<h1>Connor S. Reed</h1>

 <h2>General Interests</h2>
<p>In a broad sense, I am interested in the application of data to encourage better decisions. In other words, I am interested in using statistics, data science, and domain specific knowledge to create systematic and data informed decision making processes. To this point, the bulk of my experience has been in the field of professional sports, but these tools are relevant to nearly every field.</p>


 <h2>More About Me</h2>
<p>My brain tends to be very analytic and systematic. I enjoy probabilistic thinking, predictive analysis, and working in the equilibrium between efficiency and perfection in order to maximize surplus value in my work. That said, I have somewhat of an obsessive brain and do not like to leave problems unsettled. Therefore, I enjoy finding unique and creative solutions to such problems, either by working around them, or by changing my frame of reference.</p>


 <h2>Work Background</h2>

 <p>My primary background is in sports (I have experience working with a top NBA organization, doing analytics in a MLB simulation program, doing research on modern NHL analytics, working for a leading Daily Fantasy Sports player, and I currently work at the NHL). However, I am interested in any field that uses data in novel and interesting ways.

 <p>I enjoy thinking about problems from different scopes, developing new skills, and learning for learning's sake! In addition to my standard education, I have taken a number of MOOCs, with a general focus on topics in data science.</p>

 <h2>Education</h2>
 <p> <b> McGill University</b>, Montréal, QC, Canada <br />
  B.Sc. – Physical Geography Major with a Mathematics/Statistics Minor</p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
  <p>Generally, the best way to reach me is via e-mail (connor.reed.92@gmail.com) or cell-phone (listed on my <a target="_blank"  href="resume.html">résumé</a>). I am also on LinkedIn, and I keep the code to my more public facing projects on Github. Links to my profile on both sites are below.</p>
