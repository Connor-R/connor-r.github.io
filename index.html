<h1>Connor S. Reed</h1>
   
 <!--<p>I was born and raised in Santa Cruz, CA. After high school, I moved to Montréal, QC and studied at McGill University. I have now completed my undergraduate studies, returned to California, and am currently looking to start my post-university phase of life.</p>-->

 <h2>General Interests</h2>
<p>In a broad sense, I am interested in the application of data to encourage better decisions. In other words, I am interested in systematic and data informed decision making processes which can be used and applied across a full spectrum of scale. To this point, the bulk of my experience has been in the professional sports, but the application of data is relevant in any field.</p>


 <h2>Job Seeking and More About Me</h2>
<p>I am a recent graduate in search of a new symbiotic job environment. Ideally, a situation in which I am able to provide an employer with a base package of skills and knowledge, while also being an elastic worker with the potential of being molded to best fit my employer. In return, I am looking for the opportunity to learn new skills and hopefully have the tutelage of my superiors to best implement these skills into my toolbox.</p>

<p>My brain tends to be very analytic and systematic. I enjoy probabilistic thinking, predictive analysis, and working in the equilibrium between efficiency and perfection in order to maximize surplus value in my work. That said, I have somewhat of an obsessive brain and do not like to leave problems unsettled. Therefore, I enjoy finding unique and creative solutions to such problems, either by working around them, or by changing my frame of reference.</p>

<!--<p>I dislike surprises and I also believe in the importance of being cognizant of my own weaknesses. Therefore, I prefer to state what I believe my biggest weaknesses are up front to establish a better understanding between myself and an employer. Primarily, my largest deficiencies are centered around anxiety in social situations with unfamiliar people and low self confidence resulting in situations that cause me to doubt myself.</p>-->

 <h2>Work Background</h2>

 <p>My primary background has been in sports (I have experience consulting to a top daily fantasy sports MLB players, working with a top NBA organization, and doing research on modern NHL analytics). However, I am interested in any field that uses data in novel and interesting ways.

 <p>I enjoy thinking about problems from different scopes, developing new skills, and learning for learning's sake! In addition to my standard education, I have taken a number of MOOCs, with a general focus on improving my programming abilities.</p>

 <h2>Education</h2>
 <p> <b> McGill University</b>, Montréal, QC, Canada <br />
  B.Sc. (June 2016) – Physical Geography Major with a Mathematics/Statistics Minor</p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
  <p>Generally, the best way to reach me is via e-mail or cell-phone, both of which can be found on my <a target="_blank"  href="Connor_Reed_Resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>
