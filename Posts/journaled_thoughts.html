<p> 
  In an attempt to keep a history of things I've felt strongly about, I will use this page as a semi-journal of my own thoughts. Most of these are one-sided rants that I've written in various text messages threads or my Fantasy Football group chat and are based on things I've previously read or researched, but usually am not remembering perfectly off the top of my head. I requested a volunteer to: <q>keep a journal of my rants and send them to me in 5 years so I can see how wrong/right I was</q>, but it was pointed out (by Kyle) that I should instead: <q>just do it via your website somehow.</q> So Kyle, here it goes.

Regarding the New England Patriots usage of Corderelle Patterson:
<blockquote>
  <p>
  I love how the Pats are basically showing that RBs don't really matter, as they're using a 6'2 KR/discarded WR to run between the tackles. Meanwhile, the Giants are using one of the absolute most valuable assets in the sport to draft a RB in a QB heavy draft and the Seahawks hired a guy who's philosophy is: â€œto run power left, and then fool you by running power right." (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SamuelRGold/status/1057426036856623104">relevant video</a>). Though the Pats still used their 1st rounder on a RB this year too, so who knows what's going on.

Regarding the usage of the fade route:
<blockquote>
  <p>
  This is an automated post to remind you that the back corner fade is the worst passing route in football. Even with a dominant 1v1 player like Gronk/DeAndre Hopkins it's a terrible call, especially at the goal line. I have a working theory on why coaches still use it though: (A) It's fun for the receivers, (B) It requires a ton of strength/athleticism for the receiver, so when it works, it shows up on highlights. The coaches then watch the highlight and see it working. It's sort of the play-version of a running back/middle linebacker. Only the most athletic players can do it, but it's not very valuable.
  <br>...<br>
  To add to my running back/linebacker/corner fade rant, it's the same reason shot creators/tough shot makers in basketball are overrated as well. It requires a ton of athleticism and shows up on highlights, but it's still not that valuable.
