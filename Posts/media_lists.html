<h1> Documenting Media (or An Insight Into Why I Like to Make Lists) </h1>
<p>
<i>July 4, 2018</i>
</p>

<p>
  Like most humans, I enjoy consuming various forms of media. However, compared to most humans, I keep better records and/or ratings for the things that I read, watch, or listen to. I find this documentation important, as I like being able to trace the genesis of things that I have learned or heard. In the worst case scenario, if I ever lose my memories or knowledge, keeping records like this will help retrace my steps, however unlikely or depressing that may be. A more realistic reason for this notekeeping is because it is not very difficult and it brings me happiness, which is a strong enough reason on its own. As a smarter friend once told me, only somewhat hyperbolically: "You seem to enjoy record keeping more than you enjoy ____" where the blank can be filled by most things I keep lists of (e.g. <a href="../Tables/books.html">books</a>, <a href="../Tables/movies.html">movies</a>, <a href="../Tables/podcasts.html">podcasts</a>, <a href="../Tables/tvShows.html">TV shows</a>, <a href="../Tables/boudlers_completed.html">climbing</a>, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  For books, movies, podcasts, and TV shows I include scouting grades, which allows me to rank these media forms into a "Best Of" list in the case anybody is interested in such a thing. All scouting grades are on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/scouting-explained-the-20-80-scouting-scale/"> 20 to 80 scale</a>, where the 20 grade baseline is sitting in silence without thinking (for example, I would rather blast white noise loud enough that I cannot think than watch a TV show about fashion; thus, this fashion TV show would receive a grade of 20). If you're wondering why I continue watching shows or listening to podcasts that have below average ratings, it is because I generally have a completionist mindset (even though this is a prime example of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy"> Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>), so if I've invested a lot of time into watching or listening to something, I often try and make sure I've watched or listened to <i><b>all</i></b> of it , which often includes listening to years worth of backlogs of podcasts (update: I'm finally comming around to the idea of how stupid this is, and have recently stopped doing this as thoroughly). Finally, if you're wondering how I make time for all of this media, it is largely due to listening to podcasts and watching TV shows or movies at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-do-podcast-nuts-find-the-time-they-listen-at-chipmunk-speed-1499957591"> accelerated speeds</a>.
