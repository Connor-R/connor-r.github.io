<h1> 2018 (plus 2017 and 2016) NBA Draft Board </h1>
<p> 
  <i>June 9, 2018</i>
  <br> <i>Updated: June 15, 2018</i>
  <br> <i>Post-draft list: June 23, 2018</i>
</p>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
  <i>Click <a href="#2017">here for 2017 rankings</a>, and click <a href="#2016">here for 2016 rankings</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
  I'm mostly posting this to keep myself accountable and to look back on in future years. These rankings are heavily based on personal preference for certain player archetypes and my own basketball philiosophies. I especially like 3-and-D players (some of my favorite players are the rare 3-and-D point guard, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hillge01.html"> George Hill</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beverpa01.html"> Patrick Beverley</a>) and lob catching/rim protecting bigs. I value smart decision makers, decisive ball movers, smart defenders, and players who seek out smart shots (dunks/layups, corner 3s, and, of course, free throws). Finally, I believe that the most talented players are often not the most important towards winning games; <b><i>what is most impressive is not what is most valuable</b></i>. Therefore, players whose skillset revolves around shooting contested midrange jump shots, chasing blocks, scoring out of the post, or, to a lesser degree, personal shot creation are often valued too highly, while less talented offensive players who are strong individual and team defenders are frequently undervalued by fans and front offices alike.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my draft thoughts are heavily influenced by the scouting and analysis of others, primarily <a target="_blank" href="https://deanondraft.com"> Dean Demakis</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecity2"> Evan Zamir</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tothemean.com/2018/06/10/nba-draft-2018.html"> Jesse Fischer</a>, the writers at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestepien.com/"> The Stepien</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kpelton"> Kevin Pelton</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdf5X8hXBKnkVTfxuxkLiOQ/videos"> The Dime Drop</a>. I do not watch a lot of NCAA basketball, nor do I think I am a talented scout by the eye-test, so my personal opinions are derived mostly via interpreting the scouting reports from better analysts/talent evaluators, placing weight on traits I find valuable, and looking at statistical performances. Finally, I placed a lot higher weight on grouping players into tiers rather than worrying about their ordinal rank within the tier. If you're like me and more comfortable with baseball's process of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fangraphs.com/scoutboard.aspx"> grouping by Future Value</a> rather than worrying about individual rankings, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/scouting-explained-the-20-80-scouting-scale/"> Future Value</a> grades on each tier would be as follows: Tier 1 would be the 65s, Tier 2 would be 60s, Tier 3 would be 55s, Tier 4 would be 50s (average starters), Tier 5 would be 45s, and the honorable mentions would be 40s.
</p>
<p>
  There are some terms I frequently use that aren't well defined, so I'll do my best to define them here. I often use the term <b>ape index</b> (a term borrowed from rock climbing) when discussing a player's length and it measured simply as wingspan minus height. A player's <b>toolkit</b> is a combination of their physique, athleticism, fluidity, and coordination; essentially the physical abilities that are more difficult to teach. I define <b>skill</b> as a combination of ball handling and shooting ability. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html">LeBron James</a> is not an incredibly skilled player; he is an above average shooter and ball handler, but those are likely the parts of his game that are weakest. He is merely an athletic freak in a prototype body that is (mostly) immune to injury who just happens to be a basketball genius on both ends of the court. On the other hand, a player like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html">Kyrie Irving</a> may be the most skilled player in the league. He is a 99th percentile ball handler and a terrific shooter and those are easily his strongest parts to his game. However, skill is not equal to value, as there are many more outside attributes that go into making a valuable player, as shown by nobody mistaking Irving for being a better player than James. Possibly the most important outside attribute is <b>basketball IQ</b>. Offensively, I define this as a combination of a player's passing vision, decision making with the ball, timing and positioning off the ball, and creativity (e.g., seeking out and drawing contact for fouls, using fakes and misdirections to open passing lanes, setting unusal screens that better open the floor, etc.). On the defensive end, the main skills I try and identify are choosing the right shots to contest (a counter-example would be a player like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteha01.html"> Hassan Whiteside</a>, who frequently leaves his man to chase blocks) boxing out to ensure his team gets a rebound as opposed to fighting for a rebound of their own (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lopezro01.html"> Robin Lopez</a>, whose teams rebound better with him on the floor, despite him not gathering many rebounds of his own), being engaged in off-ball defense and knowing when/where to switch (really most of the players on the current Celtics, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smartma01.html">Marcus Smart</a> is especially proficient), and I have a personal attaction to players who know when to jab in a swipe for a steal as an off-ball defender (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iguodan01.html">Andre Iguodala</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/balllo01.html">Lonzo Ball</a> are both excellent at quickly swiping at the ball while staying engaged with their mark).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Post-Draft Update</b>: I've added <a href="#Post-Draft">post-draft rankings</a> for how I would value players going forward. In simple Bayesian terms, the pre-draft rankings can serve as a prior, while the post-draft rankings are the posterior, using my pre-draft rankings as a prior which are then influenced by the new information that is available (how early they were picked, what team picked them, any trades that were made involving the player).

    <br> younger (21.2) junior, plus shooter with good IQ/length, but lacks strength/athleticism/finishing
<br><br>
  <li><b><a 
    target="_blank" 
    href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/lonnie-walker-2.html">
    Lonnie Walker</a></b> - <i>Miami</i>
    <br> older (19.4) freshman, plus athleticism/wingspan, but mostly a set of tools that need molding into skills
<br><br>
  <li><b><a

    href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kenrich-williams-1.html">
    Kenrich Williams</a></b> - <i>TCU</i>
    <br> old (23.5) high energy wing with plus IQ/finishing/rebounding, but questions about shot/athleticism and probably doesn't have much development left given age
</ul>


<a id="Post-Draft"> <h2> Post-Draft 2018 Rankings </h2> </a>
<h3> Tier 1 (~65 FV)</h3>
<ol start="1"> 
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 1, Tier 1) Luka Doncic</b> - <i>Pick 1.03, Dallas Mavericks</i> 
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 2, Tier 1) Jaren Jackson Jr.</b> - <i>Pick 1.04, Memphis Grizzlies</i>
</ol>
<h3> Tier 2 (~60 FV)</h3>
<ol start="3"> 
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 3, Tier 2) Deandre Ayton</b> - <i>Pick 1.01, Phoenix Suns</i> 
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 4, Tier 2) Wendell Carter Jr.</b> - <i>Pick 1.7, Chicago Bulls</i> 
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: 8, Tier 3) Zhaire Smith</b> - <i>Pick 1.16, Philadelphia 76ers</i>
    <br> Philadelphia is a great fit for Smith. His defensive switchability and athleticism should play up in the small bursts Philly can initially allow him as he eases into the rotation.
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 5, Tier 2) Marvin Bagley III</b> - <i>Pick 1.02, Sacramento Kings</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: 10, Tier 3) Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</b> - <i>Pick 1.11, Los Angeles Clippers</i>
    <br> This is an ideal fit for Shai, who should play well next to Patrick Beverely in a unique backcourt situation.
<br><br>
</ol>
<h3> Tier 3 (~55 FV)</h3>
<ol start="8"> 
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 6, Tier 3) Miles Bridges</b>- <i>Pick 1.12, Charlotte Hornets</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 7, Tier 3) Mohamed Bamba</b> - <i>Pick 1.06, Orlando Magic</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 9, Tier 3) Kevin Huerter</b> - <i>Pick 1.19, Atlanta Hawks</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: 19, Tier 5) Robert Williams</b> - <i>Pick 1.27, Boston Celtics</i>
    <br> Williams's main limitation is his defensive IQ, and he was drafted to the absolute best situation to fix this.
<br><br>
</ol>
<h3> Tier 4 (~50 FV)</h3>
<ol start="12"> 
  <li><b> &darr; (pre-draft: 11, Tier 3) Mikal Bridges</b> - <i>Pick 1.10, Phoenix Suns</i>
    <br> Bridges fits best as a secondary piece who shouldn't be relied upon to create much on his own and Phoenix is not a great fit for this. Plus, from a team perspective, Phoenix was in need of higher varience players with bigger upside, which Bridges is not.
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 12, Tier 4) Troy Brown Jr.</b> - <i>Pick 1.15, Washington Wizards</i>
  </ul>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 13, Tier 4) Josh Okogie</b> - <i>Pick 1.20, Minnesota Timberwolves</i>
  </ul>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 14, Tier 4) Michael Porter Jr.</b> - <i>Pick 1.14, Denver Nuggets</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: 17, Tier 5) Jacob Evans</b> - <i>Pick 1.28, Golden State Warriors</i>
    <br> Evans should fit well with a loaded Golden State roster, where his high floor/low ceiling combination and strong ability to limit mistakes while making the simple play fits best.
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 15, Tier 4) De'Anthony Melton</b> - <i>Pick 2.46, Houston Rockets</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 16, Tier 4) Trae Young</b> - <i>Pick 1.05, Atlanta Hawks</i>
<br><br>
</ol>
<h3> Tier 5 (~45 FV)</h3>
<ol start="19"> 
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: 20, Tier 5) Jarred Vanderbilt</b> - <i>Pick 2.41, Denver Nuggets</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: HM) Lonnie Walker</b> - <i>Pick 1.18, San Antonio Spurs</i>
    <br> The best player development organization of the last 20 years drafts a player described as a, "set of tools that need molding into skills." Yes, this is a good fit.
<br><br>
</ol>
<h3> Honorable Mentions (~40 FV) </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Jalen Brunson</b> - <i>Pick 2.33, Dallas Mavericks</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &uarr; (pre-draft: Unranked) Donte DiVincenzo</b> - <i>Pick 1.17, Milwaukee Bucks</i>
    <br> DiVincenzo was drafted higher than I expected, by a relatively strong player development organization, and should fit well in the Bucks wing rotation.
<br><br>
  <li><b> &darr; (pre-draft: 18, Tier 5) Kevin Knox</b> - <i>Pick 1.09, New York Knicks</i>
    <li> A project player with low defensive IQ going to the Knicks isn't my favorite fit, even if they've developed better in the last couple of years between Porzingis and Ntilikina.
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Shake Milton</b> - <i>Pick 2.54, Philadelphia 76ers</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Dzanan Musa</b> - <i>Pick 1.29, Brooklyn Nets</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Elie Okobo</b> - <i>Pick 2.31, Phoenix Suns</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Collin Sexton</b> - <i>Pick 1.08, Cleveland Cavaliers</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Landry Shamet</b> - <i>Pick 1.26, Philadelphia 76ers</i>
<br><br>
  <li><b> &harr; (pre-draft: HM) Kenrich Williams</b> - <i>Undrafted</i>
<br>
</ul>
<h3> Dropped Off </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b> &darr; (pre-draft: HM) Mitchell Robinson</b> - <i>Pick 2.36, New York Knicks</i>
    <br> A player needing significant refinement and monitoring getting drafted to the most volatile organization in the league is a bad combination.
</ul>
