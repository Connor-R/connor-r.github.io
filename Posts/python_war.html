<h1> Play War (the Card Game) in Python </h1>

<p> While on a rock climbing vacation in South Africa, my friends and I were graced with lots of down time during rainstorms and in the evenings. We frequently passed this time playing board games or cards. Unfortunately, none of my friends wanted to play the <i>classic</i>, <i>mentally stimulating</i>, and <i>exceptionally fun</i> card game of <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)">War</a> with me so I spent many days wallowing in sadness over not having a willing war partner, until I finally decided to replace my human friends with my computer.
</p>
<p>
  Given the basic rules of the game and lack of user input for any strategical decisions, I figured the game would be quite easy to simulate, so I set out on making my simulator while the rest of my friends did something far less fun,  cooking dinner. After an hour, I had successfully created <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/Connor-R/connor-r.github.io/blob/master/ad_hoc/python_war.py">my simulator</a>, while all they had to show for themselves was fried rice (which was, supposedly, "really good").
</p>
<p>
  I am quite happy with how this turned out after only an hour of work. Now I can have endless fun simulating war games over and over and over and over whenever I can't find a dueling partner. Hopefully the rain ends soon, or else I'll soon have to simulate another game, maybe <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Fish
">Go Fish</a> is next.
