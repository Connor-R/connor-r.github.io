<h1>2018/19 NBA Team Interest Levels</h2>
<p> 
  <i>October 16, 2018</i>
</p>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
  I felt like quickly throwing together a post on my interest level on each NBA team entering the 2018/19 season, basically ripping off <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA">Zach Lowe's</a> yearly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24846824/zach-lowe-2018-19-nba-league-pass-rankings-part-1">League Pass Rankings</a>. Mostly, this post is to document my thoughts at the <i>beginning</i> of the season to compare how I feel at the <i>end</i> of the season. As has been <a target="_blank" href="media_lists.html">noted before</a>, I think record keeping is important and I'm trying to better document my records publicly.
</p>

<ol start="1"> 
  <li><b>Utah Jazz (9.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Stylistically pleasing</li>
      <li>Great depth</li>
      <li>Ricky Rubio/Dante Exum/Donovan Mitchell/Joe Ingles/Jae Crowder/Rudy Gobert/Ekpe Udoh are all favorites</li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Philadelphia 76ers (9.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Only thing keeping them from going higher is the hype train surrounding them</li>
      <li>Robert Covington is a favorite</li>
      <li>Zhaire Smith is one of my favorite rookies</li>
      <li>Ben Simmons is one of a few players in the league with all-time great vision (other players I can think of: LeBron James, Lonzo Ball, James Harden, likely Luka Doncic)</li>
      <li>Joel Embiid has the skill and personality to be the face of the NBA</li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Toronto Raptors (8.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Tons of favorite players (Lowry/Green/Leonard/VanVleet/Anunoby/Siakam)</li>
      <li>Early viewings of Nick Nurse's coaching style give me hope they could be extremely fun</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Miami Heat (8.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>"Jazz East"</li>
      <li>Stylistically pleasing</li>
      <li>Fun depth</li>
      <li>Love Josh Richardson, Bam Adebayo, and Justise Winslow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Denver Nuggets (8.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Nikola Jokic might be my favorite player to watch</li>
      <li>Jamal Murray/Gary Harris/Paul Millsap all rank highly as well</li>
      <li>Why did they give Mason Plumlee so much money?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Los Angeles Lakers (8.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Lonzo Ball is likely my 2nd favorite player to watch (behind Nikola Jokic), his passing, help defense, and cutting are unreal</li>
      <li>They would be at least a 9 without Rondo and Michael Beasley</li>
      <li>I'm high on Josh Hart and Alex Caruso</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Milwaukee Bucks (7.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Giannis Antetokounmpo is an automatic 5 interest points</li>
      <li>Malcom Brogdon, Khris Middleton, and Erson Ilyasova are favorites</li>
      <li>Eric Bledsoe and Thon Maker confuse me</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Boston Celtics (7.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Stylistically pleasing</li>
      <li>Marcus Smart/Jaylen Brown/Gordon Hayward/Jayson Tatum/Al Horford might be the most defensively versatile lineup in the league</li>
      <li>"Gordon Hayward and Aron Baynes are so light they wear sunscreen in the gym"</li>
      <li>I hope Jayson Tatum picks the right parts of Kobe's game to mimic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Brooklyn Nets (6.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm somewhat irrationally high on Brooklyn this year; they remind me of a worse version of the 2015/16 Boston Celtics with the lack of star power but a roster that goes 11 deep</li>
      <li>D'Angelo Russell's development this year could make or break their playoff chances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Indiana Pacers (6.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>CoJo/Victor Oladipo/Bojan Bogdanovic/Myles Turner are personal cheeseballs</li>
      <li>Hated their last 2 drafts with Holiday and Leaf</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Houston Rockets (6.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>They would be at least a 7.5 without Melo and Michael Carter-Williams</li>
      <li>Maybe this is the year my Zhou Qi draft day rankings start to show some value</li>
      <li>Marquese Chriss has potential to be the next JaVale McGee of watchability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Dallas Mavericks (6.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Luka Doncic is worth 5 ranking points by himself</li>
      <li>Dwight Powell is quietly very entertaining and Dirk Nowitzki/JJ Barea have some nostalgic appeal</li>
      <li>The rest of the team is relatively boring</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Golden State Warriors (5.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Who plays between Bell/Jones/Looney?</li>
      <li>How well does DeMarcus Cousins integrate (once healthy)?</li>
      <li>Is Jacob Evans an NBA player this year?</li>
      <li>Where is Patrick McCaw?</li>
      <li>How much do any of the Hamptons 5 (plus Shaun Livingston) try during the regular season?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Portland Trail Blazers (5.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Lillard Time may be the single most exciting time during regular season NBA basketball</li>
      <li>Lineups with Damian Lillard, Seth Curry, and CJ McCollum are going to be pretty fun</li>
      <li>I was super high on Caleb Swanigan at one point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Oklahoma City Thunder (5.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Tons of players I like (Roberson/Abrines/Luwawu-Cabarrot/George/Patterson/Adams/Noel)</li>
      <li>Russell Westbrook/Jerami Grant are two of the most explosive athletes at their positions</li>
      <li>Extremely stylistically dis-pleasing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Chicago Bulls (4.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Wendell Carter Jr. is one of my favorite rookies this year</li>
      <li>Lauri Markkanen was one of my favorites rookies last year</li>
      <li>Kris Dunn and Jabari Parker are two of my least favorite young players</li>
      <li>Zach LaVine confuses me</li>
      <li>Fred Hoiberg does not seem like a good NBA coach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>New Orleans Pelicans (4.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Weird situation where 3 of the best 4 players all want to play the 4 (unless AD finally gives in and realizes he's a 5)</li>
      <li>Jahlil Okafor is becoming a 20/10 threat now that he's vegan and Elfrid Payton is going to shoot 40% from 3 now that he cut his hair (sarcasm)</li>
      <li>AD, Nikola Mirotic, and Jrue Holiday save the grade from slipping into the bottom echelon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Memphis Grizzlies (3.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Really sad that this is where Jaren Jackson Jr. ended up, they would be a 2 at best without him</li>
      <li>I'm rooting for a full recovery for Mike Conley</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Washington Wizards (3.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>John Wall is a more pleasing (to me) version of RWB</li>
      <li>The junior wings (Otto Porter Jr., Kelly Oubre Jr., Troy Brown Jr.) are fun and I want to see lineups with all 3</li>
      <li>Wizards of years past have had the worst end-of-game offensive strategy in the league (lots of isolation 18 foot jumpers and bricked floaters) and I imagine it will stay that way this year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Los Angeles Clippers (3.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Tuning in for the PG (Patrick Beverely/Milos Teodosic/Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) and backup C (Boban Marjanovic/Montrezl Harrell) minutes</li>
      <li>If all 5 are ever on the floor at the same time I might faint</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Minnesota Timberwolves (3.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Wish Tyus Jones was appreciated more, I think he's better than Jeff Teague</li>
      <li>Josh Okogie was a draft favorite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Sacramento Kings (2.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>I like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Willie Cauley-Stein quite a bit</li>
      <li>How do they handle frontcourt minutes between the young (WCS/Bagley/Labissiere/Giles) and old (Randolph/Koufos/Bjelica)?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Cleveland Cavaliers (2.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>They're going to be relatively boring, but I think the 7th seed is a realistically possibility since they have a lot of NBA caliber players, which not all the teams in the East feature</li>
      <li>I hope JR Smith takes 15 FGA per game</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Phoenix Suns (2.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>I really want Dragan Bender to be good (him and Zhou Qi are maybe my two biggest draft over-rankings so far)</li>
      <li>The Mikal Bridges trade will likely go down as a franchise altering one (in a bad way)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>San Antonio Spurs (2.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Oh how the mighty have fallen; the late 00's/early 10's Spurs teams were true 10s</li>
      <li>I'm disinterested in watching DDR/Gay/Aldridge isolate and shoot 16 foot jumpers</li>
      <li>Popovich's greatest accomplishment may be making this team watchable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Atlanta Hawks (1.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of John Collins/Kevin Huerter/Taurean Prince will be interesting</li>
      <li>Does Trae Young provide any value outside of PNR offense?</li>
      <li>BAZEMORE</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Orlando Magic (1.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Jonathan Isaac (and a little bit of Aaron Gordon) keeps them from being a 1</li>
      <li>Mo Bamba *could* be extremely fun</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Charlotte Hornets (1.5)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Kemba Walker and Nic Batum are the only reasons they aren't a straight up 1</li>
      <li>Tony Parker will look very strange in a Hornets jersey</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>Detroit Pistons (1.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Unless Dwayne Casey coaches out of his mind, an offense centered around Jackson/Griffin/Drummond is have no space and be relatively boring</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><b>New York Knicks (1.0)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>It's bad when the players I'm most interested in are draft busts from 4 years ago</li>
      <li>I hope they don't mess up the development of Knox and Ntilikina, they could be 3/5th of a good team with Porzingod one day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
