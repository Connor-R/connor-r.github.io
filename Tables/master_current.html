The ball doesn't just sound different off of his bat; when he really lays into one, you can feel a thump inside your chest as if someone set off a firework at home plate. Its explosive, beautiful, and paradoxically violent considering that Vladimir is so childlike in his shape and demeanor. He plays with a vivacious enthusiasm, totally unashamed of his own at times bizarre mannerisms, as if the way he feels when playing elite pro baseball is how most of us did with a wiffle ball in our hands during adolescence. (Late during Fall League, he was cranky and petulant with umpires.)   But his is not a childlike stature. His listed 6-foot-1, 200 pounds is a farce, and on the few occasions that Guerrero and Peter Alonso (who is listed at 6-foot-3, 245) were standing near one another during Fall League, Vlad was clearly the larger human being. While he reaches an almost shocking top speed on the bases given his size, Guerrero does have lateral mobility issues that impact his range at third base. He is very likely to move to first base or DH at some point in his early 20s, but leaving him at third, even if he's not very good there, might help motivate him to keep his weight in check for as long as possible, something that could be more important than the quality of his play in the field since Vlad had knee issues during the 2018 season.   Really though, it matters very little where he ends up playing. This is the best hitter in the minors and the stick will play anywhere. For at least two years now people around baseball, including the late Mel Didier, swore that Guerrero would be ready for and competing in the majors before he turned 20. Toronto's desire to maintain control of his talent for as long as possible scuttled that notion late last summer when they chose not to promote him, and Vlad will turn 20 in March before this season even starts. He should be up early this year, and immediately become one of the game's most exciting, productive hitters. He is the cornerstone of the Blue Jays franchise, and perhaps a cornerstone of our sport.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - TOR\"","2019","70","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 80 | Power: 70 | Run: 45 | Arm: 60 | Field: 45 | Overall: 70  The Blue Jays knew they were getting a special talent when they signed Vlad Jr. -- the son of 2004 AL MVP and Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero -- for $3.9 million in July 2015, after he had ranked as the top international prospect in his class. In the three-plus years since, he's cemented himself as the best hitter in the Minor Leagues by consistently torching advanced pitching as a younger player at every level. That was especially true last season, when Guerrero batted .402 and .336 at Double- and Triple-A, respectively, to finish his age-19 campaign with an MiLB-best .381 average. He also led the Minors in slugging (.636) and OPS (1.073), finishing the season on the cusp on the Majors before a turn in the Arizona Fall League.  Guerrero is an elite, generational-type hitter who stands out as much for his physical tools at the plate as his approach and capacity for making adjustments. His swing is both explosive and efficient, a combination of electric bat speed, physical strength and off-the-charts barrel control, and it makes him adept at crushing both heaters and secondary pitches to all parts of the field. He has 80-grade raw power and hit a career-high 20 home runs in 2018, but it's widely agreed that Guerrero is merely scraping the surface of his power ceiling. His pitch recognition and feel for the strike zone belie his age and experience, as he absolutely punishes mistakes, seldom expands his zone and rarely strikes out.  Whether Guerrero can stick as a third baseman is still a burning question. The Blue Jays were pleased with the gains he made there in 2018, noting that he improved his athleticism and overall footwork at the position and showed more arm strength than he did in previous years. It makes him a passable defender at the hot corner for now, but his below-average speed, thick build and modest range portend a move to first base in the future. Regardless of where he ends up on the field, Guerrero is set to become one of baseball's premier hitters, with the ceiling of a perennial MVP candidate.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"MLB\"","1","\"2015 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"61.8\"","\"63.6\"","\"64.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","65","65","80","40","45","60","70","70","80","30","45","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","80","70","45","60","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"1st\""],["2","2","2","2","8","\"68.3\"","\"64.2\"","\"68.6\"","\"58.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"59.4\"","\"|\"","\"Wander\"","\"Franco\"","2019","\"18.3\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"189\"","\"professional\"","400","6","\"|\"","1941","677551","","","\"sa3007033\"","\"|\"","1","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2021","70","\"OsxMtDgMaI0\"","\"Franco is really close to a perfect prospect, as he's plus at almost everything he tries, and has one of the best pro debuts we've ever seen.\"","\"Franco was identified as a top tier player in his age group as early as 12 or 13, and was seen regularly by scouts by age 14. Sometimes, precocious prospects are workout warriors or have early physical peaks, but Franco isn't either of those. He essentially hasn't failed on a baseball field in any meaningful way since puberty, with his success punctuated by a 2018 pro debut in which he outpaced the game's most recent phenom, No. 1 overall prospect Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., in just about every way, at the same level, at the same age. Franco signed for the largest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class ($3.825 million) and was seen as the best player in the class by a good margin. There were some questions about his occasionally disinterested style of play as an amateur, but he likely already had a deal done and didn't have anything to play for in later workouts. He's literally always been the best player on any field he's been on, usually by a lot. The raw tools are accordingly loud, and match his stats: at least a plus hit tool with explosive bat speed, elite bat and body control, and an advanced sense of the zone to go along with plus raw power, plus speed, a plus arm, and a real chance to stick at shortstop. Franco is about as close as you'll see to a perfect prospect at this point, with questions only arising if you really nitpick -- the main one being that Franco isn't tall -- but he already has huge power, so it matters less that he isn't physically projectable. The Rays have indicated they will start Franco at Low-A in 2019 and, so long as he keeps performing, keep pushing him until he's challenged so he can experience adversity before he reaches the big leagues. It wouldn't surprise us to see Franco move across multiple levels, but we wouldn't expect a Juan Soto-esque pace of promotion, and a 2019 MLB debut seems incredibly unlikely, given the Rays' upper-level infield glut and the service time implications. Rays officials have likened their immediate impression of Franco, as a player and person, to Evan Longoria. Teammates respond to him, and there isn't even a whiff of the makeup concern some scouts conjured up as an amateur. Franco seems to be the sole author of his potential at this point.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - TB\"","2021","65","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 70 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 65  A switch-hitting shortstop with deep baseball ties in his family, Franco ranked as MLB Pipeline's No. 2 international prospect before signing with Tampa Bay for $3,825,000 at the outset of the 2017-18 period. The Dominican Republic native made the jump stateside for his pro debut last season and promptly established himself as one of baseball's better prospects by winning the Rookie-level Appalachian League's MVP Award at age 17. Playing against considerably older competition, he produced a .351/.418/.587 line with 11 home runs in 61 games and led the circuit with 85 hits and 57 RBIs.  Franco's robust production during his pro debut reflects his high offensive ceiling. He consistently impacts the baseball from both sides of the plate, showing a combination of bat speed, strong wrists/hands and elite bat-to-ball skills that leads some scouts to project him as a plus-plus hitter. He should offer above-average over-the-fence power, too, especially from the left side of the plate, from where he hit all but one of his home runs in 2018. Franco's approach, much like his physical tools, is advanced beyond his years, and he receives raves for his ability to recognize spin and control the zone.   In the field, Franco has impressed evaluators with his hands, range and actions at shortstop, not to mention the high level of confidence he exudes. He could outgrow the position and shift over to second or possibly third base, though such a move would do little to detract from his All-Star-caliber ceiling. While the Rays have historically employed a patient approach in developing young talent, Franco could be the rare exception, as many have already identified him as the next teenage wunderkind to reach the Major Leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"A\"","1","\"2017 J2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","13","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"60.0\"","\"57.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","1.0","1.0","\"|\"","35","30","60","60","45","60","65","55","65","60","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","70","55","60","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["3","3","3","6","3","\"67.7\"","\"63.6\"","\"65.0\"","\"60.7\"","\"58.2\"","\"60.9\"","\"|\"","\"Victor\"","\"Robles\"","2019","\"22.0\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","260","4","\"|\"","1413","645302","","18363","\"sa828409\"","\"|\"","5","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","2","","\"Low\"","2019","65","\"3VwXSd7XgXo\"","\"He lacks big raw power, but Robles has every other tool and they all play up because he has terrific feel and instincts. He should be a great defensive center fielder and baserunner who makes lots of quality gap-to-gap contact.\"","\"If not for a hyperextended elbow that shelved him for several months in 2018, Robles wouldn't be on this list. (The injury to Robles was also part of why Washington pushed Juan Soto along quickly.) In the 2017 Fall League (he missed some time that season due to hamstring tightness), he looked both readier and nearly as talented as fellow Fall Leaguer Ronald Acua, and it seemed certain that he'd be up for good at some point the following spring. But in April an awkward dive on a shallow fly ball that most center fielders wouldn't even have sniffed at bent Robles' elbow backward and based on the way he writhed around in pain, the injury appeared catastrophic. X-rays were negative and an MRI showed no structural damage, but Robles didn't start swinging a bat for a month and a half and was out of game action for three. He spent July and August rehabbing before a great September in Washington, during which he slashed .288/.348/.525. This is a do-everything center fielder who glides from gap to gap, has runner-halting arm strength, and plus-plus speed that is aided by seemingly sixth-sense instincts on the bases. Robles has middling bat speed and doesn't generate huge exit velocity, but he has above-average hand-eye coordination, bat control, and pitch recognition, and a gap-to-gap approach that suits his speed. He'll slug on paper by turning the line drives he slaps into the gaps in to extra bases. Robles has slightly below-average plate discipline, which may dilute his production for a bit, but he projects as a 3-plus WAR center fielder with a skillset akin to Lorenzo Cain's, and he's big league ready right now.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"MLB\"","1","\"2013 J2 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"58.2\"","\"60.9\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","60","45","50","70","70","70","65","50","50","70","70","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["4","4","5","5","14","\"66.6\"","\"61.8\"","\"65.0\"","\"56.9\"","\"52.6\"","\"57.3\"","\"|\"","\"Forrest\"","\"Whitley\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"79\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","380","6","\"|\"","1691","666215","\"whitley_forrest\"","","\"sa917930\"","\"|\"","4","\"Alamo Heights HS (TX)\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2019","65","\"5krfMUxyV_M\"","\"Whitley has five -- count 'em five -- excellent pitches, including one of the minors' highest curveball spin rates and best changeups.

At that event, he was sitting in the 90-92 range with feel for locating a solid-average curveball. He looked like a mature-bodied pitchability prospect whose stuff might be done improving. During that fall and winter, though, Whitley began to reshape his physique. He dropped about 50 pounds and came out the following spring with much better stuff, his fastball creeping into the 93-95 range and touching 97.   Whitley and his stuff have continued to improve, though he had a somewhat chaotic 2018. He missed the season's first 50 games due to a suspension for the use of an unknown stimulant, then had his season debut pushed back due to a lat strain. He finally toed the rubber at Double-A Corpus Christi in June and made five four-inning starts before he was removed in the first inning of his sixth outing and placed on the IL with an oblique strain. He missed a little over a month, then made two more starts in August before feeling lat discomfort warming up for what would have been a third. He was shut down as a precaution and sent to the Arizona Fall League to pick up innings.   His stuff was wholly intact in Arizona, as Whitley sat 93-97 and touched 99. His apparitional changeup haunts both left and right-handed hitters, disappearing beneath barrels as it approaches the plate. Whitley's array of breaking stuff is well-designed. His power 12-6 curveball honors his Texas heritage but has been de-emphasized as an out pitch in deference to his tilting, mid-80s slider. He has the best collection of stuff in the minor leagues, and might have been in the big leagues last year if not for various setbacks. He may be on somewhat of an innings limit this year because he didn't pitch all that much in 2018, but barring that, we expect he'll help the Astros cause at some point in 2019. \"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","\"2016, 1st (17) - HOU\"","","2019","65","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 65 | Control: 50 | Overall: 65  The Astros rated Whitley as the best high school arm in the 2016 Draft and were thrilled that he lasted until they picked at No. 17, where he signed for $3,148,000 as the sixth prep pitcher selected. In 2017, he averaged 13.9 strikeouts per nine innings and joined Zack Greinke, Chad Billingsley, Clayton Kershaw and Dylan Bundy as the only high school first-rounders this millennium to pitch in Double-A during their first full pro season. His encore wasn't as successful, as he worked just 26 1/3 regular-season innings because of a 50-game suspension for violating the Minor League drug program and minor oblique and lat injuries.  Whitley got more work in the Arizona Fall League, where he was the developmental circuit's strikeout leader and showed why he's considered the best pitching prospect in baseball. He can make hitters look bad with his entire repertoire, starting with a 93-98 mph fastball with natural life (heavy sink down or cutting action up in the zone) and a devastating changeup with fade and depth. He has a pair of high-spin, power breaking balls with a 12-to-6 curveball and a late-biting slider, and he can turn the latter into a true cutter in the low 90s.  Whitley's biggest present need is to refine his command. He'll sometimes pitch exclusively out of the stretch to concentrate on repeating his delivery, which isn't the smoothest but contains no glaring red flags. His stuff is so good that he doesn't have to locate it with precision to succeed, but he looks like a dominant No. 1 starter when he does.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"AAA\"","1","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"52.5\"","\"58.8\"","\"52.9\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.1667","1.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2550","3000","40","70","60","60","60","50","","50","70","70","60","65","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","65","60","60","","","","50","\"CIN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["5","5","4","3","19","\"65.7\"","\"62.5\"","\"66.4\"","\"56.3\"","\"51.3\"","\"56.7\"","\"|\"","\"Fernando\"","\"Tatis Jr.\"","2019","\"20.4\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","390","6","\"|\"","1096","665487","","19709","\"sa919910\"","\"|\"","3","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2019","65","\"f-7iDniIWf0\"","\"Tatis still has a chance to turn into some version of Manny Machado, but opinions differ on how much we should be concerned about his contact ability.\"","\"Though his numbers were mostly the same as they were during a very impressive 2018 at Double-A San Antonio (.286/.355/.507, 16 HR, 16 SB), Tatis appeared to come of age during the offseason in the higher-stakes environment of the Dominican Winter League. Except for the sliver of our population who are both prospect hounds and savvy internet streamers, Tatis' LIDOM brilliance was mostly obscured from American eyes, and may one day exist only as an oral history, the way John Lucas and Bernard King's D.C. summer league cameos do for basketball fans today.   Nevertheless, MLB scouts and teams are well-aware of Tatis' all-world physical gifts, but the Padres knew first. Scouted and snatched away from the Camelback Ranch backfields by A.J. Preller himself, Tatis had barely worn a White Sox uniform before he was flipped to San Diego for James Shields during 2016 Extended Spring. He wasn't a highly-regarded amateur prospect when he signed the year before the trade, but he got better very quickly and essentially hasn't stopped. He has Carlos Correa's frame, but is more agile and acrobatic a defender than Correa, and while there's some risk that Tatis will eventually fill out beyond viability at shortstop, it probably won't be for a while, and in the interim he's going to be quite good there. He also has power that is rare for the big leagues generally, let alone for a middle infielder, and he has gotten to it in games thus far despite some issues with strikeouts. There's a sizable gap between the low-end of Tatis' possible outcomes (he moves to third quickly and always has contact issues) and the high end (he becomes a plus glove at short and has an offensive trajectory like George Springer's, whose contact issues suddenly went away) but right tail outcomes like this barely exist across baseball.   Strikeout-prone prospects often require some time to adjust and can take a little bit to perform, but we like Tatis' chances to become a superstar, the crest of the Padres' wave of young talent and a cornerstone of a burgeoning franchise.\"","\"|\"","","\"SD\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - CWS\"","2019","70","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 70    The son of former 11-year Major Leaguer Fernando Tatis signed with the White Sox for $700,000 in July 2015, after he had ranked 30th on MLB Pipeline's list of the Top 30 international prospects. He was on the move a little less than a year later, going from Chicago to the Padres as part of the James Shields trade. In his first full season in 2017, Tatis became the first 18-year-old in Class A Midwest League history to post at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, before making the jump straight to Double-A in August. He returned to the level last season and was nearing another 20-20 campaign, with 16 homers and 16 steals through 88 games, until he underwent season-ending surgery for a fractured thumb that he sustained on a head-first slide in late July. He made up for some of that lost time during the offseason with an impressive performance in the Dominican Winter League.    As a shortstop capable of hitting for a high average with at least plus power, Tatis has one of the highest offensive ceilings in the Minors. He crushes the ball to all fields with an explosive but fluid right-handed swing that features a combination of bat speed, barrel awareness and huge extension through contact. His plus-plus raw power plays from line to line because he's comfortable letting the ball travel deep into the zone. While he can be too aggressive at times, leading to some swing-and-miss issues, Tatis has a consistent approach, puts together good at-bats and shows a high capacity for making adjustments. He also makes an impact on the bases, and he's improved his speed to the point where evaluators now view him as a plus runner.    Tatis has the necessary athleticism and tools required to stick at shortstop. He profiles as an above-average defender there, with a quick first step, good range and a strong arm that fuel his knack for making highlight-reel plays on a daily basis. While he could still outgrow the position, given his remaining physical projection, Tatis' bat could make him a perennial All-Star, perhaps even an MVP candidate, in his prime.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"MLB\"","1","\"2015 J2 (CHW)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"49.5\"","\"56.8\"","\"56.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","50","60","65","50","60","50","60","70","55","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","60","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["6","6","8","10","5","\"64.2\"","\"60.5\"","\"61.4\"","\"59.4\"","\"56.5\"","\"59.7\"","\"|\"","\"Casey\"","\"Mize\"","2019","\"22.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","360","6","\"|\"","2385","663554","\"mize_casey\"","","\"sa3008444\"","\"|\"","10","\"Auburn\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","60","\"KTLpXoKizJU\"","\"Mize has a non-zero chance of turning into a version of Aaron Nola, and he'll likely be big league ready in 2019.\"","\"Mize was a midrange projection arm in high school and broke out on the Cape after his freshman year at Auburn. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate Team USA, then took a giant leap forward in his draft spring, which led to Detroit taking him first overall. His command improved and he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch, to pair with his mid-90's fastball, above average slider, and plus splitter. After pitching for Team USA the summer before the draft, Mize got a PRP injection in his pitching elbow. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder in high school, and he also missed time a sophomore at Auburn with forearm tightness.   Mize has some violence to his delivery and isn't the prototypical projectable plus athlete you normally see at the top of the draft. There's also some anecdotal evidence suggesting heavy cutter usage leads to diminished velocity. These are all things to make you wonder how Mize projects, but right now he may be able to pitch in the big leagues, with some mentioning Aaron Nola as the type of pitcher he could become. He's already made an adjustment to his slider that has given the pitch   more verticl depth, like a slurve, which adds a new movement wrinkle to his mix.  He doesn't really fit Detroit's timeline for contention, and may not be as good in his sixth year of control as he'll be in his second, so many have openly wondered if Mize becomes a trade chip once he succeeds in the big leagues. That's a good problem to have for a big league club in need of top shelf talent; Mize may give them that as soon as 2019. \"","\"|\"","","\"DET\"","\"2018, 1st (1) - DET\"","","2020","65","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Splitter: 70 | Control: 60 | Overall: 65  Undrafted out of high school, Mize honored his commitment to Auburn and blossomed into one of the top college pitchers in the nation. His combination of stuff and control improved in each of his three years there, and he became the highest drafted player in program history when Detroit made him the No. 1 overall pick and signed him for $7.5 million, a record in the bonus pool era. A lengthy junior campaign during which Mize accrued 114 2/3 innings prompted the Tigers to limit his workload after signing, though it certainly didn't keep the right-hander from having an impressive pro debut that concluded with four abbreviated starts in the Florida State League.   With plus command and the ability to induce whiffs with three different pitches, Mize has the ingredients needed to headline a starting rotation. A plus-plus splitter in the mid-80s that dives at the plate is his best offering, and he's adept at locating the pitch down in the zone or below it. Mize sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider took a step forward as a junior, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to manipulate it into a harder cutter when he desires. Mize has long shown a knack for pounding the zone and attacking hitters. He finished first in NCAA Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posted similar numbers as a junior while finishing third among D-I hurlers with 156 strikeouts.  That Mize was shut down in 2017 at Auburn and again in the summer with Team USA due to a tired arm and flexor strain in his forearm raises concerns about his durability. However, he did his part by staying healthy throughout his 2018 campaign, and neither his athletic frame nor his clean delivery have a glaring flaw.

Toward the end of showcase season, scouts started throwing around Derek Jeter comparisons, saying that Lewis had a similar frame with chance for a 70 bat, 55 raw power, and the possibility to stick at shortstop with some work. Others saw closer to a 50 or 55 bat and a center fielder, and his draft spring was up-and-down, with scouts that charted all of his games reporting his hitting stats were not strong, though the tools were all still present.   The Twins took him first overall and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a top tier of talent without a clear top prospect. Things have gone even better than expected for Lewis in pro ball, and he's hit above league average at every stop and reached High-A at age 19 while improving defensively at shortstop. Most scouts think he can stick there, which was not the case even a year ago, and one long-time scout even said Lewis is ahead of where Jeter was defensively at the same stage. We'll call it a 60 bat with 50 game power and 50 defense, but there's ceiling for more in here.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","\"2017, 1st (1) - MIN\"","","2020","65","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 70 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 65  While it surprised some when the Twins took Lewis with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 Draft, the toolsy infielder has shown quickly that he was worthy of being taken in the top spot. The California high schooler made it to the full-season Midwest League in his summer debut, then performed his way up to the Florida State League in his first full season. While he may have been fatigued down the stretch, he did homer three times in helping Fort Myers win the FSL title at the end of the year.    A premium athlete, Lewis has impressive tools across the board combined with instincts and makeup that allow them all to play up consistently. He consistently makes hard contact with an advanced approach at the plate, drawing walks while not striking out a ton. He can drive the ball to all fields and his over-the-fence power started showing up, with more to come. His speed should allow him to continue to be a serious basestealing threat. He had a very positive year at shortstop defensively, showing a ton of improvement. There's still room for him to improve the consistency of his throws, but the Twins think he could be an above-average defender when all is said and done.    Lewis was the youngest player in the Florida State League when he got there at age 19, so he's already well ahead of the curve. Seeing him in Minnesota at age 21, with a future as an All-Star level player, seems completely reasonable.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"A+\"","1","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"55.5\"","\"53.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","50","60","40","55","60","50","55","60","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","70","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["8","8","6","7","6","\"62.3\"","\"61.3\"","\"62.9\"","\"59.2\"","\"54.8\"","\"59.6\"","\"|\"","\"Eloy\"","\"Jimenez\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","370","6","\"|\"","21","650391","","17484","\"sa830373\"","\"|\"","8","\"Dominican Republic\"","-1","2","","\"High\"","2019","60","\"rGa1I4XSrsE\"","\"Jimenez's body has gotten very big, very quickly, and he has had a myriad of injury issues, but he has also performed at every minor league level and has cartoonish all-fields power that plays in games because he also has good feel for contact.\"","\"Even before the White Sox acquired Jimenez from the Cubs in the Jose Quintana trade, he had dealt with a multitude of injuries. Hamstring and shoulder issues plagued him while he was still with the Cubs, and limited him to DH duty, or forced him to sit out for a few days at a time, or altogether kept rehabbing him on the Mesa backfields. He has continued to have various issues since the South Siders acquired him. In 2018 alone, Jimenez dealt with patella tendinitis during the early part of spring training, then was left back in extended due to a strained pec. He suffered a strained left adductor in July, and finally a quad strain this winter, which ended his Dominican Winter League season.   But while Eloy has missed considerable time with injuries and sometimes played through them, he has mashed like few other players in the minors. He split 2018 between Double-A Birmingham and Triple-A Charlotte, slashing .337/.384/.577, his strikeout rate plummeting to 13% at the latter stop. Despite his limited speed and at-bats, he somehow managed to net 53 extra-base hits and seemed ready for a big league cup of coffee in September. The White Sox refused to brew him one, and Eloy's agent threatened to file a grievance against the club, an issue that was resolved during 2019 spring training with a record contract extension. He'll likely be up all year, and while we think there's a chance injury or a lack of mobility limit Eloy's ceiling the way flaws have similarly limited some of Chicago's other recent prospect graduates, we still think he'll hit enough to be a star.\"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","","\"Aug. 1, 2013 - CHC\"","2019","70","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 65 | Power: 70 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 70  Jimenez has blossomed from the top-rated talent on the 2013 international market to one of the best hitting prospects in recent memory, rivaled in the current Minor League crop only by the Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Signed by the Cubs for $2.8 million out of the Dominican Republic, he broke out as the Class A Midwest League's MVP in 2016 and went to the White Sox the next year as the prize in a four-prospect package for Jose Quintana. He has continued to improve since changing organizations and set career highs in all three slash categories (.337/.384/.577) and home runs (22) in 2018 despite battling injuries to his left pectoral and adductor muscles.  Jimenez has some of the best raw power in baseball, which he generates with electric bat speed plus the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame. His pop has elicited comparisons to Giancarlo Stanton, but he's a better hitter than Stanton. He excels at recognizing pitches and making adjustments, allowing him to repeatedly barrel the ball with high exit velocities to all fields.  The White Sox are banking on Jimenez's offensive prowess making him a superstar -- before he made his big league debut, they gave him a six-year contract worth $43 million with two option years that could push the total value to $75 million -- but he won't provide a lot of value outside the batter's box. He has slowed down as he has matured physically and is now a below-average runner.

He missed most of May battling vertigo symptoms for the second time in nine months (they first started in late August '17), then fractured a finger in late-June and missed the rest of the season. He was supposed to play in the Fall League, but a return of the left elbow pain he had played through during the year became severe enough that he needed an MRI, which revealed bone spurs. He had surgery and was shut down for the year. When Senzel did play, he was very good and slashed .310/.378/.509 in 44 games at Triple-A while playing second base for the first time in affiliated ball. Senzel's likely future defensive home is still to be determined. He wasn't a very good defensive third baseman early in college but became one as a junior. The presence of Eugenio Suarez led to reps at second base, and Scooter Gennett's emergence led to what was supposed to be reps in left and center field this fall before Senzel needed surgery. The departure of Billy Hamilton leaves an obvious hole that he could potentially fill, but he hasn't been seen playing center enough to know for sure. At the very least, he has stumbled into defensive versatility. Mostly though, Senzel hits. He doesnt have monster raw power, nor does he seek to take max-effort swings by utilizing a big stride or leg kick. Instead, his power comes from precise, high-quality contact. Hes going to be a doubles machine with home runs coming opportunistically rather than playing core aspect of his approach, but hell still hit for power. He has the skills and polish of a near-ready star, and the injuries don't seem like they're going to be a chronic thing. \"","\"|\"","","\"CIN\"","\"2016, 1st (2) - CIN\"","","2019","65","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 65 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 65    The No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 Draft, Senzel seemed poised to complete his relatively brief time in player development during 2018, only to be delayed by injuries. First, he missed time with a bout of vertigo in May and then came a fractured right index finger that required season-ending surgery in June. Bone spurs in his elbow cut short his fall work as well. But there was a lot to like in the short amount of time that Senzel did play.    Senzel is an athletic player whose bat is just about ready for the highest level. That's not surprising given he was billed as the top pure hitter in his Draft class. Originally a third baseman out of Tennessee, he can handle the hot corner and he also has the makings of an above-average second baseman. He got some reps in center and left field during instructs as the Reds continue to look for ways to get his bat into the big league lineup soon, as he is blocked at second and third.     When healthy, Senzel uses a combination of strength and bat speed, along with an advanced approach at the plate, to be an extremely dangerous hitter from the right side. He makes consistent hard contact, doesn't strike out a lot and draws walks, which points to a future of hitting over .300 and perhaps competing for batting titles. He could debut as an everyday utility player until a permanent spot opens for him.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CIN\"","\"MLB\"","1","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"50.5\"","\"60.5\"","\"57.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","55","40","55","55","45","55","70","55","55","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","65","55","60","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PHI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["10","10","11","16","9","\"61.6\"","\"58.7\"","\"60.0\"","\"58.1\"","\"48.2\"","\"59.0\"","\"|\"","\"Taylor\"","\"Trammell\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"LF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","350","6","\"|\"","1720","666211","\"trammell_taylor\"","","\"sa917943\"","\"|\"","7","\"Mount Paran HS (GA)\"","2","1","","\"Med\"","2021","60","\"M_E6U1FxIGw\"","\"Trammell has the explosive tools and football background of Carl Crawford, but has better feel for the game at the same stage of development.\"","\"Trammell has uncommon on-field self-awareness for a two-sport high school athlete who was only 20 last year.

Trammell also put on a shocking display during BP at the Futures Game and hit two absolute seeds during the game. He never did anything remotely like that in the Fall League (nor, frankly, did any of the other prospects who played in D.C. and then later in Arizona) and actually struggled to turn on balls there, but there's a chance of huge, if dormant, in-game power here, too. Though Trammell runs well enough to play center field (by a lot), his arm strength still might limit him to left field. That's where we have him projected, where we think he'll be a Carl Crawford or Brett Gardner type of defender.

That was especially true with Trammell, who signed for $3.2 million at No. 35 overall. The former Georgia high school star has impressed at every stop of his development and really stood out on a national stage when he won MVP honors at the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in '18 after homering and tripling.    A multi-sport athlete in high school who had the chance to play football at Georgia Tech, Trammell's combination of natural ability, feel for the game and makeup have continued to lift him as he progresses through the system. In the Florida State League in 2018, while dealing with a nagging ankle injury, he continued efforts to lower his strikeout rate and draw walks, and he still showed left-handed pop while driving the ball. His ability to get on base will make him a regular stolen base threat that could frustrate defenses.     That speed gives Trammell the chance to be a future center fielder. He has a below average arm, something he worked on during his stint in the Arizona Fall League.

The swing and miss issues he exhibited in high school led many to assume his development might be slow, but after a month of vaporizing Low-A pitching at Burlington, he was quickly sent to the Cal League, where he'd spend most of the year. At Inland Empire, Adell continued to perform, and the Angels pushed him to Double-A Mobile in August, where he was finally forced to deal with some adversity, and struck out 31% of the time.   Several prospects of recent memory (Byron Buxton, Domonic Brown, and Brandon Wood to name a few) have possessed such titanic physical gifts that they essentially weren't challenged until they reached the big leagues, and some people in baseball posit that it can be psychologically taxing to deal with growing pains in that bright of a spotlight, with the hopes of a franchise and its fans on one's shoulders. Adell is that kind of physical talent. He has a rare blend of power and speed, speed that he has retained since high school even though he has added about 20 pounds. He's now a better bet to stay in center field during his prime than he was in high school, when scouts assumed he'd slow down as he added weight. His feel for going back on balls in center is pretty good and some of the arm strength that Adell (who was once into the mid-90s on the mound) suddenly lost in high school has returned.   His breaking ball recognition and bat control will continue to be tested by upper-level pitching, and if they start to show improvement, it's not only a sign that Adell is adjusting but that he has the capacity to do so in the future. At that point, we're talking prime Andrew McCutchen and Grady Sizemore-type tools.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2017, 1st (10) - LAA\"","","2020","60","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 60 | Run: 65 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 60    Remember when there was concern about Adell's ability to hit at the pro level coming out of the Kentucky high school ranks in 2017, even though he was the state's Gatorade Player of the Year and led all prepsters with 25 home runs? Yeah, no one else does, either, not after Adell raked across two levels of Rookie ball during his summer debut then hit his way all the way to Double-A at age 19 in 2018, fitting in a Futures Game appearance for good measure. Hamstring and ankle injuries shelved him in Spring Training, and he was sidelined for an extended period of time.    While the swing-and-miss tendencies that concerned some scouts still remain with Adell, his bat speed and ability to read pitches and make adjustments more than outstrip the worry. He's shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields and his over-the-fence pop started showing up consistently during his first full season. Yes, Adell can still refine his overall approach to see more pitches and draw more walks, but the strides he has quickly made in pitch recognition bode well for his future at the plate. Adell's speed works on both sides of the ball, giving him the ability to steal some bases and enough range to play center field, especially as he improves his reads and routes.     Should he slow down a touch as he physically matures, Adell has shown the ability to play the outfield corners. A shoulder issue that kept him from playing the outfield in 2017 is a distant memory and the plus arm that allowed him to crank out plus fastballs from the mound in high school has returned. The five-tool outfielder is way ahead of schedule and could be patrolling the Angels outfield alongside Mike Trout sooner rather than later.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"AA\"","1","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"47.3\"","\"58.6\"","\"56.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","50","70","60","50","50","50","70","70","55","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","60","65","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["12","12","10","8","35","\"61.5\"","\"58.7\"","\"61.4\"","\"55.1\"","\"48.8\"","\"55.7\"","\"|\"","\"MacKenzie\"","\"Gore\"","2019","\"20.3\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","360","6","\"|\"","2079","669022","\"gore_mackenzie\"","","\"sa3005068\"","\"|\"","11","\"Whiteville HS (NC)\"","2","-1","","\"High\"","2021","60","\"7bZP4Vs1QhA\"","\"Gore's athleticism enables him to locate a bevy of good pitches despite a weird delivery that serves to disorient hitters.\"","\"Blisters and fingernail issues were a minor problem during Gore's 2017 pro debut, and shelved him three separate times throughout 2018. His stuff was intact when he pitched, his fastball resting mostly in the 92-94 range and topping around 96 during most of his starts, though he has peaked at 98.   He is mechanically non-traditional, something Gore is able to maintain because he's such a great athlete. As his front leg kicks up before he pedals toward the plate, so too does his glove and pitching hand, way up over his head, as if his mitt and knee are connected by an invisible wire. When Gore comes home, he drifts toward the first base side of the mound a bit, creating a unique angle on his pitches.   And those pitches are good. Though he doesn't have great natural ability to spin the ball, Gore's over-the-top arm slot enables him to get tumble on his curveball anyway, he has very advanced changeup feel, and his slider is firm. He'll be able to locate what he wants, where he wants for as long as he retains his top-of-the-scale athleticism. He may be on a bit of an innings count this year just because he only threw 66 innings in 2018, but otherwise he's quite advanced and could move through the minors fairly quickly. \"","\"|\"","","\"SD\"","\"2017, 1st (3) - SD\"","","2021","65","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 65    As a Whiteville (N.C.) HS junior, Gore went 12-1 with a 0.08 ERA and 174 strikeouts in 83 1/3 innings. He somehow improved upon those results the next year, going 11-0 with a 0.19 ERA and a 158-to-5 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 74 1/3 innings en route to 2017 Gatorade National Player of the Year honors. The Padres viewed Gore as the top prospect in his class and were ecstatic to land the southpaw with the No. 3 overall pick, signing him for $6.7 million. Assigned to Class A Fort Wayne in 2018, Gore was plagued by a blister issue on his throwing hand that twice landed him on the disabled list, and the Padres decided to shut him down for the season in August after another flare-up.    Though he pitched with slightly diminished stuff last season due to injury, Gore still showed the makings of developing a front-of-the-rotation-caliber arsenal. His fastball sits at 93-95 mph and can touch 96, often playing above its velocity due to its late life. He has a pair of breaking balls in a mid-70s curve, a plus pitch and nets him plenty of whiffs, and a hard slider in the low 80s. The Padres expect both offerings to be sharper as Gore distances himself from the blister issue. He rounds out his arsenal with a tumbling changeup that has plus potential, and everything he throws plays up due to his big, athletic leg kick and because he gets good extension toward the plate, both of which help create a deceptive look for hitters on both sides of the plate.    Gore is lauded for his competitiveness and overall aptitude on the mound. Those qualities, along with his potential for four above-average-or-better offerings, could make the young lefty a future front-of-the-rotation piece. Already on his way toward achieving that projection, Gore stands to rise quickly through the Minors compared to his Draft-class peers, as long as he stays healthy.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","2","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.9\"","\"57.1\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","2.0","-1.0","1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","1850","45","55","50","50","45","","","60","55","60","55","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","60","55","","","","55","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["13","13","17","23","18","\"61.4\"","\"57.5\"","\"58.6\"","\"56.3\"","\"51.4\"","\"56.8\"","\"|\"","\"Sixto\"","\"Sanchez\"","2019","\"20.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","340","6","\"|\"","1850","664350","","","\"sa873550\"","\"|\"","18","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2020","60","\"OFHkPmNCPOI\"","\"Shoulder issues have limited Sanchez's workload during each of the last two seasons, but he has a rare combination of present stuff and command, which is shocking considering he hasn't been pitching for all that long.\"","\"Sanchez's first 2019 start -- during which he walked an uncharacteristically high four hitters and spent much of the outing rotating his head and neck about his shoulders, and stretching his arm and upper back -- was perhaps a harbinger of things to come; his season would later end due to multiple injuries. After that rough first start, his stuff and command were as they usually are. He was generating upper-90s velocity with ease, his breaking balls were crisp, and his changeups were well-located and moving. He walked just seven hitters in his final seven starts of the year before succumbing to elbow inflammation, which ended his regular season in early-June. Sanchez rehabbed in Florida in anticipation of an Arizona Fall League assignment and threw some tune up innings early during the 2018 fall instructional league, his stuff intact and ready for Arizona. Then he awoke one morning with soreness in his collarbone. After an MRI it was determined that Sixto would have to shut things down for a bit and head to Arizona quite late, so he was just shelved for the year. Sanchez has now missed time to injury in two consecutive seasons. In each year, he has often been given extended rest between starts and dealt with issues in his neck and collarbone area. That isn't ideal and all else being equal, we'd rather have a pitching prospect without this kind of injury history. But all else isn't equal when one lines up Sixto's stuff and command, both of which are very advanced for a conversion arm so new to pitching, against the stuff and command of other minor league pitchers. This is one of the most talented pitching prospects on Earth, one with top of the rotation potential.

But starting with his United States debut in '16, when he won the Gulf Coast League ERA crown, he's been raising his prospect value exponentially. The only thing that's slowed him down has been the injury bug, with elbow inflammation shutting him down in early June in 2018, though that didn't stop the Marlins from insisting Sanchez be included in the package they received for trading J.T. Realmuto to Philadelphia in February.    When healthy, Sanchez has perhaps the best combination of electric stuff and command of any pitcher in the Minor Leagues. He might appear undersized at six-feet tall, but he's deceptively strong, with an athletic and repeatable delivery. Sanchez throws both a two- and four-seam fastball, the former thrown with a lot of sink to get ground-ball outs and the latter cranked up to triple digits at times. Not only can Sanchez maintain velocity deep into starts, the fastball plays up because of movement and his plus command of the pitch. He can add and subtract from his breaking ball, and seeing it as a future plus strikeout pitch isn't out of the question. He shows good feel for his changeup as well, giving him the chance to have at least three above-average offerings.    Sanchez's workload has been limited, partially because of understandable caution and partially because of injury. A healthy and complete 2019 should help get him ready for an eventual career at or near the top of a big league rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"AA\"","1","\"2014 J2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"57.1\"","\"55.8\"","\"|\"","1.7500","0.0000","0.1667","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2750","45","65","50","55","45","","","55","65","60","60","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","75","55","55","","","","","60","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["14","14","15","14","29","\"60.9\"","\"57.8\"","\"60.0\"","\"55.4\"","\"46.6\"","\"56.2\"","\"|\"","\"Adley\"","\"Rutschman\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"216\"","\"draft\"","475","8","\"|\"","2812","","\"rutschman_adley\"","","","\"|\"","9","\"Oregon State\"","1","2","","\"Med\"","2020","60","\"riXzQCIbfPw\"","\"Excellent defensive catcher with current all-fields power and feel for contact.

He held the top spot, wire-to-wire, during the subsequent 12 months, which included him hitting .427/.584/.772 as a junior. It's because Rustchman is good at everything. Remarkably mobile for someone his size, he comfortably has the skills to not only stay at catcher, but excel there. He's an agile ball-blocker, he can throw, and he's a con artist pitch-framer who gets umpires booed because fans are convinced they're all strikes. On top of that, this is a switch-hitter with both power and feel for contact from both sides of the plate and an intense, earnest, vocal leader.

He capped things off by being a member of USA Baseball's National Collegiate Team over the summer and has kept on rolling on both sides of the ball this spring.    The switch-hitting backstop is the complete package at and behind the plate. He has an advanced approach at the plate, walking more than he's struck out at Oregon State, with the ability to make consistent, hard contact and drive the ball from both sides of the plate. He'd been more of a gap-to-gap doubles hitter, but the over-the-fence power started to show up more during his junior season.       Rutschman is also outstanding behind the plate, with excellent hands, agility and a very strong throwing arm. He's even a better runner than some give him credit for. With his all-around skills at a premium position while playing at the pinnacle of college baseball, Rutschman will be at the forefront of all conversations for the top pick in the Draft.

His mid-90s fastball plays up due to great extension, and further incorporation of a running two-seamer has given May's heater enough tail to miss bats in the strike zone. His vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. It's May's out pitch, but he also has a developing cutter and its movement is a great foil for his two-seamer. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now.   The leg kick makes May slow to home and he may be vulnerable to the stolen base because of it, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners.

He advanced to Double-A at age 20 and thrived there, winning the clinching game of the Texas League playoffs.  Los Angeles has had May switch from a four-seam fastball to a two-seamer, which jumped 3 mph last season to sit at 92-97 mph with groundball-inducing run and sink. After he threw a curveball and slider that tended to blend together, the Dodgers had him concentrate on the curve, which has become a hard-breaking weapon that also creates groundouts. He added a cutter in 2018 and it has become a solid third pitch that reaches the low 90s.  May also has a changeup, and while it's raw and gets too firm at times, he shows enough aptitude that it should become an average fourth offering.

Most importantly, his arm strength is once again viable at second base. An elbow injury relegated Hiura to DH-only duty as a junior at UC Irvine, and he may have gone even earlier in the 2017 draft if not for concerns about the injury and how it might limit his defense. That's no longer a concern, as Hiura has an average arm and plays an unspectacular second base. This is an incredible hitter. He has lightning-quick hands that square up premium velocity and possesses a rare blend of power and bat control. Hiura's footwork in the box is a little noisier than it has to be, and if any of his swing's elements are ill-timed, it can throw off the rest of his cut. This, combined with an aggressive style of hitting, could cause him to be streaky. But ultimately he's an exceptional hitting talent and he's going to play a premium defensive position.

The Brewers were not one of them, as they selected Hiura with the No. 9 overall pick, signed him for below slot value at $4 million and then watched him tear up his pro debut. He continued to rake in his first full season, first in the Class A Advanced Carolina League and then in Double-A, earning a Futures Game selection along the way. Hiura tied a bow on his year with a standout performance as the Arizona Fall League's MVP.  Hiura's swing is a thing of beauty, as he combines explosive bat speed and good physical strength with tremendous bat-to-ball skills and barrel awareness. It enables him to generate consistently loud contact, with the ball jumping off his bat to all fields. That preternatural feel for impacting the baseball fuels Hiura's projection as a potential plus-plus hitter who also offers at least above-average game power. Though not a basestealing threat, Hiura does possess average speed and earns high marks for his baserunning and awareness.  The Brewers believed that Hiura could make a successful recovery from his elbow injury without needing surgery, and he completed a throwing program in Rookie ball during his pro debut before appearing in games at second base without issue during instructs and in 2018. He's an average defender at the position, with decent actions and footwork, though his below-average arm strength can be exposed on longer throws. Any concerns about Hiura's glove will be outweighed by his huge upside as a middle-of-the-order bat, as there are few players in the Minors who can rival his combination of hitting ability and power.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AAA\"","1","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"49.5\"","\"56.8\"","\"58.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","45","60","45","45","45","60","60","60","45","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","70","60","50","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["17","17","19","12","52","\"60.4\"","\"57.3\"","\"60.0\"","\"54.1\"","\"45.3\"","\"54.9\"","\"|\"","\"Cristian\"","\"Pache\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","350","6","\"|\"","1080","665506","","","\"sa916722\"","\"|\"","15","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","0","","\"Med\"","2021","60","\"ALCsGpZ1oiA\"","\"An elite defensive center field prospect like Pache needs to do very little with the bat to be a good everyday player, and while his statistics leave much to be desired, he has flashed feel for contact and in-game raw power, just never both for any real length of time.\"","\"If we told you a prospect seemed like an injury-independent lock to play elite outfield defense, how much offense would he have to provide to be a star-level player?

He's a plus to plus-plus runner with a great first step, and he has a knack for contorting his body in ways that enable him to make spectacular catches on flyballs that would otherwise fall in for tough-luck hits. He also has a 70-grade arm when he sets and throws properly, though at times he sacrifices velocity and accuracy in order to get rid of the ball more quickly, which isn't always the right decision. Pache also has good bat-to-ball skills and solid average raw power, but the quality of his at-bats and his hitting mechanics both vary. His upside is enormous if everything comes together, and Pache just turned 20 years old, but there's risk that the bat plays down because of Pache's approach. If that's the case, he might exist in the Hamilton/Pillar area of WAR production, but even a one-dimensional offensive profile likely results in star level production and because Pache is still just the age of a college sophomore, we anticipate growth in this area.\"","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","","\"July 3, 2015 - ATL\"","2020","60","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 70 | Arm: 70 | Field: 70 | Overall: 60    Ever since Pache signed back in July 2015, when he was one of the better international prospects available in that signing class, he's shown off his outstanding speed and defensive acumen, with hints of what kind of offensive player he could become. His bat took a step forward in 2018, allowing him to reach Double-A and more than hold his own in the Arizona Fall League as a teenager.    Pache might be the best defensive outfielder in the Minor Leagues at present and once he gets to the big leagues, he'll immediately join a list of elite-level center fielders. His speed allows him to cover a tremendous amount of ground and his plus instincts, reads and routes allow that to play up even more. He has a gun for an arm to go with it that would more than work in right, though there is zero question he's a Gold Glove caliber center fielder long-term. Pache's straight running speed is close to top of the scale, but he's yet to translate it effectively in terms of stolen bases. Pache's power is just starting to show up, at least in terms of extra-base ability, and he's showing signs of making adjustments to his swing that could eventually allow him to approach average power in the future.     If he can continue to refine that swing and his approach, Pache has the potential to be an All-Star caliber player.

As is the case with many Louisville commits, his asking price was high. He got to campus and took such an immediate step forward that he was invited to play for college Team USA after just his freshman year. His tools steadily progressed and entering his draft spring, McKay was showing effortless 65-grade raw power, and above-average raw stuff on the mound. On draft day, we think a slight majority of teams preferred McKay as a hitter (the two of us were split). But every MLB team had him as a first round talent both ways, so it seemed inevitable that he would be the rare player who would get a chance to do both in pro ball so his team could at least have time to determine which path was the right one if he couldn't do both. That open-minded approach has driven how Tampa Bay has developed McKay. In 2018, his offense was fine -- he was unlucky by advanced and TrackMan metrics -- while he really broke out as a pitcher, regularly showing all the best stuff that he had only flashed in college. McKay leaned on a low-to-mid-90s fastball and didn't have trouble navigating lineups because of his above average to plus command of the pitch. A plus-flashing curveball is his best secondary offering, but his cutter and changeup are both above-average, giving him No. 2 or 3 starter upside, and he's not a long way off from reaching it. Shohei Ohtani's usage is the only precedent for how McKay might be handled: a standout, playoff rotation-caliber starter and DH. Given how baseball is valuing first base/DH players, there appears to be much more value on the mound for McKay, but there's still a real chance he turns into something like a 110 wRC+ hitter who could make a club just on the merits of his hitting and fielding ability as a first baseman, and scouts have always raved about his makeup and work ethic. The most exciting scenario would be if Tampa Bay paired him with a two-way righty (Tanner Dodson was a high pick in 2018 that will play both ways) and pull the gambit Joe Maddon has tried before: rotating righty and lefty pitchers between the mound and a spot in the field based on the matchups. It could be an effective strategy on its own while enabling roster flexibility in other areas, and it saves matchup relievers until later in the game. Of course, nobody wants the Rays to get too cute and spoil what might just be a traditional, mid-rotation profile.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2017, 1st (4) - TB\"","","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Cutter: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 55  Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 30 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The recipient of the John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year Award in each of his three seasons at Louisville, McKay was regarded by many as the best two-way Draft prospect since Dave Winfield in 1973. He took home both the Golden Spikes and Dick Howser Awards as college baseball's top player as a junior in 2017, when he went 11-3 with a 2.56 ERA and a school-record 146 strikeouts in 16 starts while also hitting .341 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs. The Rays have continued to develop McKay as a two-way player in pro ball after selecting him No. 4 overall and signing him for $7,007,500, though so far he's had more success on the mound.  McKay operates with a 92-95 mph fastball and commands it exceptionally well against hitters on both sides of the plate. Both his curveball and cutter project to be above-average pitches, with the latter currently ahead of the former, and he's developed good feel for a changeup as a pro after using it sparingly in college. Everything he throws plays up because he has plus command and knows how to sequence his pitches. As a hitter, McKay demonstrates a patient, discerning approach, with a knack for getting on base, though his overall impact with the bat has been underwhelming as a pro.  McKay was limited in his first full season by a pair of oblique injuries, the second of which he sustained while swinging, highlighting the inherent risk of developing a two-way player. The Rays would like to reduce McKay's overall workload in 2019 and won't deploy him as a first baseman, although a return to the position later in McKay's career has not been ruled out. The club still is very interested in developing McKay's bat, however, and the plan is to have him DH around his pitching schedule as they continue to develop him as a two-way player.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AAA\"","2","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"43.2\"","\"53.6\"","","\"53.6\"","\"57.9\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","65","35","45","60","55","55","65","30","50","60","\"|\"","","2300","2150","55","55","50","55","","50","","60","55","55","60","","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","","55","","","60","\"MIN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["19","19","14","11","34","\"59.9\"","\"57.9\"","\"60.0\"","\"55.1\"","\"48.8\"","\"55.6\"","\"|\"","\"Bo\"","\"Bichette\"","2019","\"21.2\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","350","6","\"|\"","1661","666182","\"bichette_bo\"","","\"sa917949\"","\"|\"","5","\"Lakewood HS (FL)\"","0","2","","\"High\"","2020","60","\"lRUNUyhGHkM\"","\"Bichette had a solid 2018 and still has a shot to be a 60 hit/60 power middle infielder.\"","\"There's some contextual disappointment surrounding Bichette's 2018 statline because he didn't recreate his video game numbers from the year before, but he still netted an incredible 61 extra-base hits as a 20-year-old at Double-A.

Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter where he ends up playing defense because his bat is likely to profile. He has scintillating bat speed, and Bichette's hand-eye coordination and bat control are an effective foil for the garage band noisiness of his swing, which hasn't negatively impacted his ability to make contact in pro ball. Bichette ditches his leg kick with two strikes, something we're not certain is all that helpful based on visual evidence. Ideally, Bichette will start lifting the ball more often (he has a league-average ground ball rate right now) and turn some of these doubles into homers, but it's hard to justify making a change when he has been wildly successful so far.

He made an immediate impact after signing, hitting .427/.451/.732 in his pro debut, and then paced the Minors with a .362 average the following year in his first full season. Spending all of 2018 as a 20-year-old in Double-A, Bichette led the Eastern League in hits (154), doubles (43), extra-base hits (61), runs scored (95) and total bases (244) as the circuit's second-youngest regular. Along the way, he represented the U.S. in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game for a second straight year.   Bichette has a violent swing but controls it well, generating an abundance of hard, line-drive contact across the field through a combination of bat speed, bat-to-ball skills and a clean path through the zone. He does overswing sometimes, which leads to some off-balance whiffs, but the overall approach is mature, and he's comfortable shortening his swing with two strikes. Bichette is physically strong for his size, possessing plus raw power that should translate to above-average game power in the future. While not a burner, Bichette is an average runner with exceptional baserunning instincts, and he finished second in the Eastern League with 32 steals.  Bichette worked hard on improving his defense at shortstop last offseason and continued to make gains as the season unfolded, showing cleaner footwork and actions as well as a more consistent glove to his backhand. He has the requisite above-average arm strength for the position, though his arm stroke can at times be inconsistent, and some scouts peg him as a second baseman long term. Whether he ends up at shortstop or the keystone, Bichette is going to make an impact at the plate, with the potential to compete for batting titles in his prime.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AAA\"","1","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.8\"","\"55.9\"","\"54.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","40","60","45","45","60","60","55","60","45","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","65","55","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"LAN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["20","20","26","31","25","\"59.8\"","\"55.9\"","\"56.4\"","\"55.8\"","\"50.7\"","\"56.3\"","\"|\"","\"Jesus\"","\"Luzardo\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"209\"","\"professional\"","330","6","\"|\"","1741","666200","\"luzardo_jesus\"","","\"sa917981\"","\"|\"","24","\"Stoneman Douglas HS (FL)\"","1","2","","\"Med\"","2019","55","\"XPMeIpPKW2k\"","\"Luzardo's stuff spiked when he was a high school senior, then he broke, then the stuff came back, then he was traded and rocketed through the A's system. He may end up with three plus pitches and plus command.\"","\"The summer before his senior year of high school, Luzardo looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and need Tommy John.   After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) was not enough time for many teams to have high-level decision makers in to see him and take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and continued to strengthen his body. When he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal.   He has quickly climbed Oakland's minor league ladder and reached Triple-A at age 20 in 2018. Those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant. Luzardo will vary the shape of his breaking ball -- he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters, he back foot it to righties -- and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties. His delivery is a bit violent but it doesn't inhibit his command, and Luzardo's musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school. His fastball, which has been up to 97 in his big league appearances this spring, may not play like a mid-90s heater because he is undersized and a short-strider, but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt.   He has mid-rotation upside and is abnormally polished. We may see him in Oakland this year.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2016, 3rd (94) - WSH\"","","2019","60","\"Scouting Grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 60 | Overall: 60     When the A's got Luzardo from the Nationals as part of the package in return for Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson, they knew the left-hander was the prize acquisition, even though he had just returned to the mound in 2017 after having Tommy John surgery in the spring of his senior year of high school in Florida. They may not have known he'd show why he was the best player in the deal so quickly, as Luzardo began the year with a leap to the California League to start 2018 and finished it in Triple-A, working in a start for the World Team in the All-Star Futures Game for good measure.    Now considered the top left-handed pitching prospect in the game, Luzardo's pitchability and polish have him just about ready to impact a big league rotation. Right before his elbow injury, Luzardo's velocity had spiked, raising his Draft stock. It's come all the way back post-surgery, with a fastball that often sits in the mid-90s and touches as high as 98 mph. Thrown with excellent sink and outstanding command to both sides of the plate, Luzardo both misses bats and gets groundball outs. His best secondary offering is his fading and sinking changeup, a second plus pitch in his arsenal. His curve has improved and is at least above-average, a pitch he adds to and subtracts from at will.     With his stuff, command and plus presence on the mound, there isn't much more for Luzardo to prove in the Minors. He'll spend the 2019 season at age 21 with the chance to pitch at, or near, the top of a big league rotation soon, though his chance to make that rotation on Opening Day ended with a left shoulder strain during Spring Training.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"A+\"","1","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (WAS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"49.2\"","\"56.7\"","\"55.0\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2600","45","55","50","","55","","","55","55","60","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","60","55","","","","","60","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["21","21","20","20","55","\"58.6\"","\"56.6\"","\"58.6\"","\"54.0\"","\"47.5\"","\"54.6\"","\"|\"","\"Ke'Bryan\"","\"Hayes\"","2019","\"22.3\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","340","6","\"|\"","1140","663647","\"hayes_kebryan\"","","\"sa874730\"","\"|\"","19","\"Concordia Lutheran HS (TX)\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","60","\"o76lKnW1nX0\"","\"Hayes is an elite third base defender with contact skills who has performed through Double-A.

The younger Hayes was identified as a potential early-round pick pretty early in high school and eventually climbed to the back of the first round after a strong senior spring. He was drafted 32nd overall and signed for $1.8 million rather than head to Tennesse, where he and Nick Senzel would have played together for a year. Hayes has moved through the minors quickly and had a strong 2018 season at Double-A Altoona -- .293/.375/.444 with an 11% BB%, 16.5% K%, 31 2Bs, 12 SB -- in what would have been his draft year. He's one of the best defensive third basemen in the minors and has progressed to become an above-average hitter, as well. A flat-planed swing and conservative hitting footwork are stifling the in-game power production. For Hayes, that's fine. He does everything else.   It's possible the Pirates will try to coax more power of out him by tweaking either his footwork or by moving his hands, the latter of which feels riskier.

After a strong season in Double-A that included a trip to the Futures Game and an Eastern League All-Star nod, the younger Hayes has the chance to be a better all-around player than his dad.    Hayes continues to improve as a hitter. He's always had a solid approach at the plate, but it's become even more refined, with a walk rate that went up for a third straight season in 2018. So did his ability to drive the ball. While he still largely uses a contact-first approach, Hayes set career highs in extra-base hits and slugging percentage, and there's more over-the-fence power to come as he matures and continues to add strength. That might slow him down a touch, but he's still smart enough on the basepaths to steal bases. There might not be a better defensive third baseman in the Minors, with his agility, hands, arm and instincts all pointing to future Gold Glove awards.     Hayes will be 22 years old for all of the 2019 season, with plenty of room for growth from an already-impressive toolset.

In the seven minor league starts before his big league debut, Kopech walked just four batters, and he was similarly efficient in his first few big league outings. His velocity was down and the Tigers shelled him in his final start, and an MRI revealed Kopech would need Tommy John. The timing was particularly cruel, not just because things had started to click, but also because late-season TJs usually cost the pitcher all of the next year; Kopech isn't expected to be back until 2020.   His stuff is great, headlined by a mid-90s fastball that often crests 100 mph. The command inroads Kopech made late in 2018 are especially important for his ability to deal with lefties, because his changeup feel is not very good. He'll need to mix his two breaking balls together to deal with them, and his slider feel is way ahead of the curveball.

He blossomed into one of the game's top pitching prospects in his new organization and gave up just one run in his first three big league starts last August. He got hammered and had diminished velocity in his fourth, after which he learned that he needed elbow reconstruction that will sideline him throughout 2019.  Before he got hurt, Kopech showcased some of the nastiest stuff in the Minor Leagues and earned comparisons to Noah Syndergaard. Hitters have great difficulty catching up to his fastball, which parks at 95-99 mph and often reaches triple digits with late running action. They're also overmatched by his mid- to upper-80s slider with two-plane break, a true wipeout offering at its best.  Kopech also throws a sinking changeup that has its moments but can get too firm, and he has added a curveball to give him an offering with greater velocity separation from his fastball. He has battled his control for much of his pro career, especially when he rushes his delivery, though he seemed to turn a corner when he totaled four walks in his final seven Triple-A starts.

It's possible the two didn't pair well together and that a better changeup, or a third pitch, will be needed in order to miss bats.

Injuries hampered him early in his pro career, but he still made it to Triple-A at age 22 and started the All-Star Futures Game in 2018, earning a spot on the 40-man roster in the offseason.    The velocity jump that Keller showed in his senior year of high school has largely stayed with him.

He was so dominant during his first few pro starts in the DSL that the Padres quickly pushed him stateside for the remainder of 2017, then to the Midwest League at age 18 the following year.   Not only does Patio have premium arm strength, but he has natural feel for spin, and is a curious learner who quickly actualizes instruction on the mound. He has already begun to vary the cadence of his delivery to mess with hitters' timing, and has mapped aspects of MacKenzie Gore's delivery to his own, just to see if it works for him.

Patino is both athletic and physically strong for his age, with present feel for throwing and locating four pitches. His quick right arm generates a fastball that's been up to 98 mph and usually sits in the low-to-mid-90s with late life thanks to his extension toward the plate. Patino's power slider in the upper 80s is a swing-and-miss offering, and he also shows aptitude for executing an above-average curveball as well as a changeup that stands to improve as he gains experience. He's consistently around the zone and could have at least above-average command once fully developed.    Patino already shows durability and holds his velocity deep into starts. His delivery and arm action require further refinement like so many young, live-armed hurlers, but he has the requisite athleticism and physical tools needed to make the proper adjustments.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","4","\"2016 J2 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"55.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2500","40","60","40","","50","","","50","65","55","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","45","55","60","","","","50","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["27","27","29","49","17","\"57.8\"","\"55.1\"","\"55.0\"","\"56.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"57.1\"","\"|\"","\"Alexander,Alex\"","\"Reyes\"","2019","\"24.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","220","4","\"|\"","985","621052","","15015","\"sa739551\"","\"|\"","45","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2019","55","\"Z_2KQ7Utxy4\"","\"Reyes' elite stuff belongs in the 60 FV tier, but constant injury has increased the likelihood that he ends up a reliever, at least for a while.\"","\"We erroneously peeled Reyes off this list during the summer. When he departed his May 30 start after four innings, he had thrown exactly 50 career frames. The MLB rule for rookie eligibility states that it has been exceeded when a pitcher has thrown more than 50 innings, so he's technically still eligible. Reyes has developed amid constant setbacks. He had a shoulder injury in 2015, a marijuana suspension that spanned the 2015 Fall League and start of the 2016 season, underwent Tommy John later in 2016 and then suffered a right lat ligament detachment in his first big league start back from TJ in 2018. The surgery to reattach his ligament took place in early June, which, with a six month recovery, means Reyes should be ready for 2019. Healthy Reyes is one of the best arm talents on the planet. His fastball will sit 93-97 and hover near 100 out of the bullpen. He'll also show you a plus changeup and curveball. His feel for each can be inconsistent, which is understandable given how little he has pitched over the last three years. If fully realized, Reyes has top of the rotation stuff. It's unclear how St. Louis will usher Reyes along next spring, both as far as his role and workload are concerned. He has the stuff to be a dominant multi-inning or high-leverage relief arm should the Cardinals think he's more likely to stay healthy that way. His innings total will likely need to be manicured somehow, and perhaps that's the way to go about building Reyes back up even if the org considers him a traditional starter long term.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AAA\"","1","\"2012 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"57.1\"","","\"|\"","1.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2600","40","70","55","60","45","","","50","70","60","70","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.650","\"2nd\""],["28","28","24","48","4","\"57.7\"","\"55.9\"","\"55.0\"","\"59.4\"","\"52.5\"","\"60.0\"","\"|\"","\"Chris\"","\"Paddack\"","2019","\"23.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","220","4","\"|\"","1923","663978","","20099","\"sa875195\"","\"|\"","34","\"Cedar Park HS (TX)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2019","55","\"YwTLMq1jxSI\"","\"Paddack wields arguably the best changeup in the minors and his fastball has big velo and tough plane, so it's probably fine that his curveball is mediocre.\"","\"Amateur scouting heuristics would not have expected Paddack be here. He was a high school draftee who was 19 and a half on draft day (draft models like young players), and had no feel for spin (something modern pitching research has determined isn't a malleable trait). The Marlins signed him for $400,000 as an eight rounder and traded him to San Diego just over a year later in exchange for Fernando Rodney. The six starts Paddack made leading up to the deal were incredible. He had a 48:2 strikeout to walk ratio during that span, and he has continued to miss bats while filling up the strike zone since the Padres acquired him. He'd probably have been in the majors last year had Tommy John surgery not robbed him of more than a year of development (Paddack blew out in his third ever start as a Padres prospect).   His stuff was fine when he returned last year, with his fastball up to 95 in his first extended spring training start back from injury, and he topped out at 98 during the year. He'll likely never have a great breaking ball, but as long as he locates it properly against righties, it will be enough. If there's an 80 changeup in the minors, this is probably it, and plenty of starters with mediocre breaking balls have survived with heavy changeup use. Paddack's fastball plays in the strike zone and he can make it sink if he wants to work down, so he shouldn't run into any game theory-related issues due to a lack of repertoire depth because his stuff is just too good to hit when he locates it, even if you properly guess what's coming. It's rare for true aces to have such limited repertoires, and we think it's more likely that Paddack develops into a 3-4 WAR starter than a demigod, the way his numbers might indicate.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","4","\"2015 Draft Rnd 8 (MIA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"52.5\"","\"60.0\"","","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2450","2050","50","60","60","45","","","","60","60","70","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TEX\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["29","29","21","18","89","\"57.4\"","\"56.3\"","\"58.6\"","\"53.3\"","\"47.4\"","\"53.8\"","\"|\"","\"Carter\"","\"Kieboom\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","340","6","\"|\"","1725","666198","\"kieboom_carter\"","19958","\"sa917937\"","\"|\"","14","\"Walton HS (GA)\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","60","\"_-90cLZAZz4\"","\"He's unlikely to stay at shortstop, but Kieboom will stay somewhere on the infield and his early-career performance suggests he's going to get to much of his plus raw power in games.\"","\"Kieboom entered 2018 with just 48 full-season games under his belt due to a nasty hamstring injury that cut short his promising 2017 campaign.

Regarded by scouts as one of the better prep hitters in his class, Carter, who signed for below slot at $2 million, has steadily built upon that reputation as a pro. After being limited by a hamstring injury in what was still a productive first full season, a healthy Kieboom broke out in 2018, earning a midseason promotion to Double-A at age 20 as well as an All-Star Futures Game selection after a torrid first half in the Carolina League. He took home the Nationals Minor League Player of the Year award after ranking among the organization's Minor League leaders with 48 extra-base hits (tied for first), 16 home runs (third) and 69 RBIs (second).  Kieboom impresses scouts with plus bat speed and loose wrists as part of a balanced right-handed swing. He's comfortable hitting to all fields, with plus raw power to his pull side that should play more from line to line as he gets stronger. He did a better job in 2018 of striking balance in his approach and consistently put together strong at-bats. While not a basestealing threat, Kieboom does have average speed, which plays up thanks to his quick feet and excellent instincts.  Kieboom has worked hard to improve his defense as a pro and projects to be at least average, with the necessary range, hands and arm strength to profile elsewhere on the infield if forced off shortstop.

It improved a bit in his second taste of Double-A in 2018, then became an issue again in his late-season promotion to Triple-A. He's fringy at shortstop and as a runner, so most scouts see him sliding over to second base long-term, but he's good enough to play shortstop everyday if a club doesn't have better options and focuses on shifting and positioning around him.

Taken No. 3 overall and signed for a franchise-record bonus of $5.5 million, he's lived up to that billing by hitting pretty much everywhere he's been, going to the Futures Game twice and reaching Triple-A just before his 22nd birthday.

The Rockies love having their infielders learn multiple positions while developing in the Minors, and Rodgers has proven to be quite adept at it. While not overly quick, his arm, hands and instincts would allow him to stick at shortstop long term and the Rockies believe he's above-average at second and third as well.

As awestruck as his swing leaves onlookers, it is imperfect and causes him to drive the ball into the ground about 50% of the time. He hits it so hard that it hasn't mattered yet, and it may not be prudent to tweak Sanchez's swing so long as he keeps performing, but the ceiling on his power output is huge if his bat path gets dialed in.

After batting .329 between two Rookie levels in '16, Sanchez moved up to the Class A Midwest League in '17 and finished second in the circuit with a .305 average while homering 15 times in 117 games for Bowling Green. Sanchez continued to rake at Class A Advanced Charlotte last season, producing a .301 average that ranked fourth in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League. He also suited up for the World team at the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in July.

After the season, the Rays added Sanchez to the 40-man roster.  Sanchez has the ingredients to be a difference-maker with the bat, as he's already shown that he can hit for both average and power during games at a young age. He has a fluid swing and an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate, and there are few within the organization who consistently hit the ball as hard as Sanchez. Scouts expect him to tap into more power as he gets stronger and learns how to lift the ball more consistently, but he will need to tone down his aggressiveness and become more selective along the way.

Waters has the chance to be an impactful hitter from both sides of the plate. Mechanical adjustments on his swing, particularly his stride, allowed him to be on time with his buggywhip stroke. He's better from the left side currently, but has shown the ability to make hard contact and drive the ball both ways, with raw power sure to turn into more consistent in-game pop as he matures. Waters' plus speed works on the basepaths, where he is a threat to steal, and in the outfield, and he has every chance to stick in center field long-term.    After a first full season in which Waters' considerable tools showed up perhaps ahead of schedule, the Braves are excited to see what the young outfielder can do as an encore. He has the chance to be a dynamic, elite-level performer, and seeing a young outfield of Acuna, Pache and Waters -- yes, he has the arm and offensive profile for right field -- in Atlanta should excite all Braves fans.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ATL\"","\"AA\"","4","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (ATL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"55.9\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","1.0","\"|\"","35","30","55","60","45","60","60","50","60","55","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","60","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["35","35","31","45","16","\"56.8\"","\"54.9\"","\"55.0\"","\"56.5\"","\"47.8\"","\"57.3\"","\"|\"","\"Nick\"","\"Madrigal\"","2019","\"22.2\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"67\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1394","663611","\"madrigal_nick\"","","\"sa3008139\"","\"|\"","32","\"Oregon State\"","1","1","","\"Low\"","2020","55","\"tQxQekapA8k\"","\"Tiny Nick Madrigal looked like a star before a broken wrist injury last February. Now, we wait and see if post-draft concerns about his size, power, and durability were just due to the lingering effects of the injury or if they're actual, long-term concerns.\"","\"When Madrigal fractured his wrist during Oregon State's second series of the year, he was hitting .560 (14-for-25) with two doubles, two homers, and three steals in three attempts. For two long weekends in Arizona he did everything. He crushed balls in all parts of the strike zone, ran plus-plus times to first base, and made several highlight reel defensive plays at second base. The wrist fracture kept him out for the rest of February, all of March, and most of April. When he returned, Madrigal kept hitting, but not for power, which is consistent with what plagues hitters for several months after they've had a break in the hand/wrist area.   That trend continued through his first pro summer, which was interrupted by a hamstring issue, as Madrigal struggled to pull and/or lift the ball at all. He had a downward, slashing swing instead of the dynamic and athletic cut he'd had early in the year, when he could scoop and lift stuff at the bottom of the zone. But he kept making contact. It was a month before a pro pitcher was able to strike Madrigal, who only K'd in 3% of his pro plate appearances last year, out.   It's fair to make a distinction between prospects who are small, and ones who are just short. Jose Altuve is short, but is built like a little tank. Madrigal is small, a diminutive 5-foot-7, 165 pounds, and this, combined with his total lack of post-draft power, has the pro side of scouting very concerned. He looked tired and sluggish during instructional league, though it wasn't as if he'd played a whole year and was an obvious candidate to be run down, furthering concerns that his size will be an issue. We're inclined to believe there's a substantial bounce-back on the horizon. He was the best draft-eligible hitter we saw last year, a complete player with few, if any, flaws.\"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","\"2018, 1st (4) - CWS\"","","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 65 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 60 | Overall: 55  The Pacific-12 Conference player of the year as a sophomore in 2017, Madrigal saw his chances of repeating end when he broke his left wrist early in his junior season. He still lived up to his reputation as the best player and hitter in college baseball and became the second-highest-drafted second baseman ever when the White Sox picked him at No. 4 overall (two spots lower than the Brewers took Rickie Weeks in 2003). After helping Oregon State win the College World Series, he signed for $6,411,400 and batted .303 in his pro debut while advancing to Class A Advanced.  Madrigal's introduction to pro ball reinforced why scouts considered him the best pure hitter in the 2018 Draft. Unfazed by advanced competition, he used his controlled right-handed swing to spray line drives all over the field while striking out just five times in 173 plate appearances. He's small and doesn't have a lot of raw strength, but his ability to barrel the ball and his plus speed should produce a healthy amount of doubles and maybe 12-15 homers per season.  Recruited by Oregon State as a shortstop, Madrigal wound up playing second base for the Beavers in deference to Cadyn Grenier, an Orioles supplemental first-rounder who was rated as the best college defender in the 2018 Draft. Madrigal has the hands and actions to play shortstop, though his average arm makes him a better fit at second base. Chicago plans on trying him at short but he spent almost all of his debut at second, where he could develop into a Gold Glover.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHW\"","\"AA\"","3","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (CHW)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"59.1\"","\"52.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","40","45","70","55","50","70","45","45","70","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","65","40","60","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["36","36","42","42","151","\"56.7\"","\"53.7\"","\"55.0\"","\"52.4\"","\"45.5\"","\"53.0\"","\"|\"","\"Luis\"","\"Urias\"","2019","\"22.0\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"69\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1924","649966","","16622","\"sa828496\"","\"|\"","21","\"Mexico\"","1","2","","\"Med\"","2019","55","\"euhgiB0OSV4\"","\"Urias reached the majors last year amid some approach tweaks in an effort to coax more power from a profile that already has top-shelf feel for contact.

He still managed to slash .296/.398/.447 as a 21-year-old in the hitter-friendly PCL and reached San Diego in September.

He won the California League batting title (.330) and MVP Award as a 19-year-old after opening the season as the circuit's youngest player, was a Double-A Texas League All-Star in 2017 and then received his first big league callup at 21 last August after a strong Triple-A campaign that included a Futures Game selection in July. Appearing in 12 games with San Diego, Urias hit .208 with two home runs before a hamstring injury ended his season.    Urias has innate bat-to-ball skills and produces hard line drives across the entire field with a compact, level swing. He has plus on-base skills because his approach, plate discipline and pitch recognition are all advanced, and he led the Texas League in on-base percentage (.398) in 2017 before posting the same mark last season in Triple-A. Urias has more power than his size suggests, and after adding a more pronounced leg kick, he got to it more often in 2018, en route to 10 home runs and 31 doubles, both career highs, between Triple-A and the Majors. While the uptick in his power came with an uncharacteristically elevated strikeout rate, Urias became more comfortable with the swing as the season unfolded and slashed .420/.480/.659 with 15 extra-base hits in August prior to his callup.    Urias' best position is second base, and he made all 12 of his big league starts there last season. He's an above-average defender at the keystone, with good lateral range, reliable hands and above-average arm strength that also enable him to play both shortstop and third base if needed. Overall, Urias profiles as a bat-first second baseman who hits for average and gets on base at a high clip from atop a big league lineup.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"AAA\"","3","\"2013 J2 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"52.7\"","\"53.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","40","20","50","50","50","65","45","35","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","70","45","50","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"LAA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["37","37","32","27","47","\"56.7\"","\"54.8\"","\"56.4\"","\"54.2\"","\"41.7\"","\"55.3\"","\"|\"","\"Bobby\"","\"Witt Jr.\"","2019","\"19.0\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"draft\"","425","8","\"|\"","2813","","\"witt_bobby\"","","","\"|\"","38","\"Coleyville Heritage HS TX)\"","2","0","","\"High\"","2023","55","","\"Plus power, speed and glove.

Gatorade named him its 2019 national high school player of the year.    A rare potential five-tool shortstop, Witt didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer but scouts aren't worried about his bat. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he could hit for average if he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player.    Witt covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. He'll turn 19 shortly after the 2019 Draft, making him old for his class and sophomore-eligible in '21 in the unlikely event he follows through on his commitment to Oklahoma.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","","1","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","2","2","\"KCR\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","\"38.2\"","\"56.4\"","\"52.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","60","30","60","50","60","50","65","60","60","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","60","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["38","38","37","41","77","\"56.5\"","\"54.1\"","\"55.0\"","\"53.5\"","\"48.3\"","\"53.9\"","\"|\"","\"Ian\"","\"Anderson\"","2019","\"21.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1708","666120","\"anderson_ian\"","","\"sa917921\"","\"|\"","35","\"Shenendowa HS (NY)\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","55","\"MxmMIeX0saw\"","\"In two seasons, Anderson has progressed from upstate New York prep standout to Double-A without many speed bumps, with above average stuff and pitchability helping him project as a likely No. 3 or 4 starter.\"","\"Anderson was a prep standout as an underclassman and despite some minor injuries in his draft year, was the third overall pick in 2016.

Anderson is the most advanced in terms of his combination of stuff now, command, and size, as evidenced by reaching Double-A at age 20 with excellent stats at every stop. He isn't the sexiest prospect in terms of spin rates, so his command will need to continue to be a separator as the hitters he faces continue to get better.

The Braves took Avery in that spot back in 1988; Anderson was the choice in 2016 and if his progress as a pro, including finishing second in the system in ERA and third in strikeouts in 2018, is any indication, he's not far from joining his predecessors.    Anderson has made strides in using his outstanding three-pitch mix more effectively, starting with a fastball he can run up to 96 mph.

His curve remains an out pitch and his changeup, which he's worked on tirelessly, also is a plus pitch at times.

His signing with Chicago marked the end of a more lucrative era for young international players who are now subject to more tight-fisted rules capping bonus amounts. Despite a limited market due to the timing of his deal, Robert signed for $26 million thanks to his all-world physical gifts. The raw power and top-end speed were obvious in workouts, but unless teams scouted him in Series Nacional or during the Cuban National team's annual CanAm League tour, little was known about his ability to hit big league-quality pitching, or what his instincts were like in center field.   Because his thumb cost him April, May, and July (he re-aggravated it), it was hard to get extended looks during 2018 until Robert's six-week stint in the Arizona Fall League (which was also interrupted by a hamstring issue). LouBob's AFL stats were fine, but his swing path left him vulnerable to velocity on the inner half, and he too often expanded the zone. There's doubt that he'll get to all of his raw power in games, both due to the swing path and lack of plate discipline, but it isn't as if he's had time to make proper adjustments yet, and the pitching he saw in Arizona was the best he's seen in his life. The ceiling is the same as it was purported to be before he signed: power, speed, offensive performance similar to Carlos Gomez's best years. There's just more risk that Robert doesn't get there.\"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","","\"May 27, 2017 - CWS\"","2020","60","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 65 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 60  Shortly before new rules severely curtailed international bonus payments, the White Sox signed Robert for $26 million -- the second-highest ever for an amateur -- and a matching amount as a tax penalty in May 2017. They expected him to move quickly after he had batted .401/.526/.687 as an 18-year-old in Cuba's top league in 2016, but his first two pro seasons were shortened by knee, ankle and thumb injuries. A hamstring strain sidelined him early in the Arizona Fall League but he returned to showcase the best all-around tools in the developmental circuit.  Though he's not a switch-hitter or an infielder, Robert has a lot of similarities to Yoan Moncada, who set the amateur bonus record with $31 million from the Red Sox before they sent him to Chicago in the Chris Sale trade. He has electric bat speed, well above-average raw power and speed, and the upside of solid or better tools across the board. Also like Moncada, the right-handed hitter comes with some swing-and-miss concerns and will need to improve his plate discipline to realize his offensive potential.  Robert went from showing solid speed in Cuba to clocking sub-6.3-second 60-yard dashes during the tryout process, and even if he loses a step as he matures physically, he could be a 30-30 player. He's still a bit raw with his reads and jumps in center field but he has the physical ability to become a solid defender up the middle with more experience. If he has to move to a corner, his strong arm and offensive profile will fit well in right field.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHW\"","\"AA\"","1","\"2017 J2 (CHW)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"53.6\"","\"51.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","-1.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","30","65","60","50","60","45","55","65","60","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","65","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"ATL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["40","40","23","17","131","\"56.2\"","\"56.1\"","\"58.6\"","\"52.7\"","\"47.1\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Keibert\"","\"Ruiz\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","340","6","\"|\"","1654","660688","","","\"sa872528\"","\"|\"","13","\"Venezuela\"","-1","1","","\"High\"","2020","60","\"jGl4H285JjI\"","\"Elite arm accuracy, receiving, and feel for contact drive Ruiz's profile, which is incomplete but still spectacular for a catcher.\"","\"Watching Ruiz catch is like watching video of Alan Shepard play golf on the moon.

He's one of the better receivers in the minors and is a better ball blocker than one would expect given his lack of athleticism, as if he has wild pitch precognition. Despite average pure arm strength, Ruiz is going to snipe a lot of would-be base-stealers because his throws are almost always right on the bag.   The skills-over-tools coloration of Ruiz's profile continues on offense, where his hand-eye coordination and bat control make him extraordinarily hard to strike out. He struck out in just 8% of his plate appearances last year as a 19/20-year-old at Double-A Tulsa.

The Astros have parlayed his natural bat control into more power. Tucker has gotten stronger and more physically mature, his lower half is better incorporated into his swing than it was in high school, and in 2017, he began lifting the ball more as his ground ball rate dropped from 42% to 34%. With that additional lift has come in-game power and Tucker has slugged well over .500 during each of the last two seasons, and hit about 25 homers during each campaign. He had a horrendous 28-game big league debut but his long track record of hitting suggests that should be heavily discounted.   Though Tucker spent much of his minor league career in center field, he's a below average runner who is ticketed for an outfield corner, probably in right. He's an opportunistic base stealer but almost all of his value is tied to his bat, and we think he eventually ends up as a middle of the order bat with a dynamic hit/power combination.

The younger brother of former Astros outfielder Preston Tucker, Kyle has breezed through the Minors since signing for $4 million and recorded 20-20 seasons in both 2017 and 2018. He led the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in slugging (.590) and OPS (.989) last year but struggled in his introduction to the big leagues.  Though he has an unorthodox left-handed stroke, Tucker makes it work with exceptional hand-eye coordination and plenty of bat speed. He recognizes pitches well and is rarely fooled, producing consistent hard contact to all fields. He manages the strike zone well and has successfully incorporated more launch angle into his swing since entering pro ball, giving him the potential to hit for high averages with 25 or more homers per season.  If there's a knock on Tucker it's that while he has continued to progress as an offensive force, he has regressed in other areas. He has average speed but doesn't always show it. He spent much of his first four years as a pro in center field, but his lack of instincts and quality route-running worked against him there. He spent more time in 2018 in right field, where he has a solid arm and can be an average defender if he continues to work at it.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"AAA\"","2","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"49.1\"","\"56.4\"","\"54.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","-1.0","\"|\"","50","50","60","40","40","55","60","60","60","40","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"LAA\"","0.500","\"1st\""],["42","42","51","96","13","\"55.6\"","\"52.8\"","\"51.4\"","\"57.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"57.8\"","\"|\"","\"Hunter\"","\"Greene\"","2019","\"19.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2076","668881","\"greene_hunter\"","","\"sa3005315\"","\"|\"","82","\"Notre Dame HS (CA)\"","2","0","","\"High\"","2021","50","\"tKAAzmpe180\"","\"Build a pitching prospect in a laboratory and the result is Greene, who has elite arm strength and athleticism. He was developing better secondary stuff, but his season ended prematurely due to an elbow sprain.\"","\"Greene is a generational on-mound athlete whose 2018 season ended with an elbow sprain. A strong two month run of starts in the early summer culminated in a 7-inning shutout start (2 H, 0 BB, 10 K, it took 69 pitches) on July 2 at Lake County followed by his feat of strength at the Futures Game.  Eleven days later, Greene's season was over. He had a PRP injection and rehabbed the sprained UCL in Arizona with broad plans to start throwing during the winter and so far, he seems on track for spring training. Greene's development was already pretty likely to be slow. He was able to throw strikes with that upper-90s fastball in high school, but his breaking ball was just okay, and he had no use for a changeup, so both of his secondary pitches were behind other pitchers in the class. Teams needed to project heavily on Greene's stuff to buy him as a top five pick, but he's such an exceptional athlete and success-oriented person that many of them did. Focusing solely on pitching for the first time, Greene's slider improved in 2018. His ceiling will be dictated by the continued development of his secondary stuff. \"","\"|\"","","\"CIN\"","\"2017, 1st (2) - CIN\"","","2022","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55    Greene, who was the No. 2 overall selection by the Reds in the 2017 Draft and received a bonus pool-era record $7.23 million because of his power arm, is being watched closely after he suffered an injury during his first full season in the Midwest League. A right elbow strain that shut him down for the year in late July was cause for concern, but was initially determined not to require surgery. He passed early incremental tests during rehabilitation, but suffered a setback in late March and it was announced he needed Tommy John surgery at the beginning of April.    The start of Greene's first full professional season had its ups and downs, as the right-hander endured many rough outings and lackluster pitching lines at the start of the year. But with a repeatable delivery and easy velocity that reaches 97-102 mph, he started finding his groove as the year went on and was very impressive during his Futures Game stint. While his fastball lights up radar guns, it often lacks life. The pitch has good finish when he keeps it down, but it straightens when Greene elevates it, making it more hittable above the knees. His secondary pitches remain works in progress, with a slider that flashes plus and a changeup, while still in the embryonic stage, that has the makings of being a solid third offering. He showed improved command and control as his first season wore on.    Off the field, Greene is polished, gracious and has the poise to help him become a star in the game if he continues to develop once he returns to action. He has the chance to pitch at, or near, the top of a rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CIN\"","\"A+\"","4","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.4\"","\"59.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"|\"","2.0000","0.0000","0.0000","2.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0004-09-19","2300","2325","40","70","45","40","50","","","60","80","55","45","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","80","50","","55","","","","55","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["43","43","40","40","149","\"55.6\"","\"53.8\"","\"55.0\"","\"52.4\"","\"49.0\"","\"52.7\"","\"|\"","\"Kyle\"","\"Wright\"","2019","\"23.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","2078","657140","\"wright_kyle\"","19665","\"sa874117\"","\"|\"","44","\"Vanderbilt\"","1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","55","\"e4af0nTNiFI\"","\"Wright starred at Vanderbilt, went fifth overall to Atlanta, and reached the big leagues a year later.

Wright mixes in a curveball and changeup that are tertiary options and his lower slot matches the sinker/slider combo a bit better. His best route to early big league success may be to lean on his breaking ball and throw it as often as his fastball, like Chris Archer or Patrick Corbin do.

Wright made quick work of the Minors, reaching the big leagues in his first full season, though he pitched sparingly out of the bullpen.    The 6-foot-4 right-hander has a four-pitch arsenal and outstanding delivery that point to a future in a big league rotation soon. He can touch the upper-90s with his fastball, sitting in the 95-96 mph range, and has shown the ability to maintain that velocity deep into his outings. He still has two distinct breaking balls and while his slider at its best might be superior to his curve, it's the latter that's more consistent. He throws his above-average changeup with excellent deception and movement.    The only thing that hasn't completely lived up to advanced billing has been his control and command.

His well-rounded skillset enticed the Mets to take him sixth overall, but he was then traded by new GM Brodie Van Wagnen as the headliner to acquire Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz. Kelenic is an intense competitor who works tirelessly, to the point that some teammates and scouts think he should reel it back in a bit at times, though they point out they'd rather have a guy who's too dedicated than one who's not enough. He's a plus straight-line runner but more of a 55 on the field, and thus isn't a slam dunk to stick in center.

It was the Mets who took the two-time U.S. national 18-and-under team member No. 6 overall, signing him for more than a million under pick value. The Mariners, who picked 14th, had brought Kelenic in for a pre-Draft workout and liked him so much, they made sure to get him as part of the return for Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz in December.    Kelenic's outstanding feel for hitting from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach, was on display during his summer debut, when he earned a promotion from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachian League. He has a knack for barreling up the baseball with solid raw power some feel will eventually translate to above-average in-game pop as he matures. An above-average runner, Kelenic is a very smart baserunner who can steal a base. The Wisconsin prep product was a center fielder in high school and that's where he played during his pro debut with the Mets. While the jury is still out about his ability to stay there long-term, he does have the arm for right field should he have to slide over.    Kelenic is mature beyond his years and gets high grades for his makeup and work ethic, so making the transition to his new organization shouldn't be too difficult.

By the end of the summer, scouts had seen enough from Kiriloff and Bo Bichette to convince them that these swings could work, and that Kirilloff and Bichette belonged in the top few rounds, with both continuing to exceedexpectations. Kirilloff went in the middle of the first round in 2016, and missed time immediately after playing his first 55 pro games with Tommy John surgery.   He came back for his first full season in 2018 and dominated both Low-A and High-A, hitting over .330 at both stops with 20 homers on the season and strikeout rates below league average. There's some chance he is even more than just a 60 hitter with 55 or 60 power, which is what most scouts are projecting right now, with something like a 15-20% chance that Kirilloff turns into the next Joey Votto. There's some disagreement about whether his 2018 season was him dominating pitching that didn't challenge him, or if he has an approach that's a little too aggressive and he just got away with it in 2018. Kirilloff is a fringy runner who's an average defender in right field and has a plus arm, but he may bulk up and move to first base down the line, which would likely come with more power as well.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","\"2016, 1st (15) - MIN\"","","2020","60","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 65 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 60    Kirilloff was one of the better pure hitters in the 2016 Draft class, taken by the Twins in the middle of the first round out of Plum High School outside of Pittsburgh. After a strong summer debut in the Rookie-level Appalachian League, however, the outfielder needed Tommy John surgery and missed all of 2017. There was uncertainty about how he would bounce back after the injury and long layoff, but Kirilloff responded by earning a promotion, going to the Futures Game and leading the Minors in total bases while finishing third in average and seventh in RBIs.    If it weren't for Blue Jays phenom Vladimir Guerrero Jr., a strong argument can be made that Kirilloff is the best hitter in the Minor Leagues. He makes consistent, hard contact and can drive the ball to all fields. He has over-the-fence power the other way and also showed he can turn on pitches when needed, while making a seamless transition up to the pitching-friendly Florida State League. He's a sound and consistent right fielder, one who makes all the plays and can stay there long-term with an average arm. He might mix in some first base, where some think he could be a plus defender, to add some positional flexibility.    That's more about making sure there's a spot for him when his bat is deemed ready, which might not be too far off in the future. He's already gained a lot of strength; the Twins are excited to see what he can do now that he's completely off of his rehab protocol and doesn't have to rediscover his timing after a year off.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"55.9\"","\"54.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","-1.0","\"|\"","35","35","55","50","45","60","60","55","60","45","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","65","55","50","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"OAK\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["46","46","54","95","33","\"55.1\"","\"52.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"55.1\"","\"51.2\"","\"55.5\"","\"|\"","\"Brent\"","\"Honeywell\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1462","641703","","","\"sa828706\"","\"|\"","69","\"Walters State JC (TN)\"","1","2","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"JC3Vetq_eAA\"","\"Honeywell is back from Tommy John surgery and his plus stuff, headlined by his wacky curveball and wackier personality, is ready for his big league debut.\"","\"Honeywell felt forearm tightness while throwing live batting practice to Wilson Ramos in late February, and five days later Dr. James Andrews was reconstructing his UCL. It was the first of several season-ending injuries Rays prospects would sustain early in the year, and it delayed Honeywell's run at a potential Rookie of the Year award. A creative sequencer, Honeywell's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in Honeywell's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though its best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat. Honeywell's delivery is pretty violent and his TJ was not his first injury, but he's ready and has No. 2 or 3 starter stuff if it comes back after the surgery.

After finishing his second full season in Double-A, Honeywell returned to the level to open '17 and received a quick bump up to the Triple-A International League, where he helped pitch Durham to a Governor's Cup title. Along the way, Honeywell was named the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game Most Valuable Player as the U.S. Team's starting pitcher. Entering '18 on the cusp of the Majors, Honeywell's chances of making his big league debut were dashed when he sustained a right elbow injury in February that required season-ending Tommy John surgery.  Honeywell has no shortage of weapons at his disposal when healthy, as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low-to-mid-90s, at times touching 95-96 mph with late sinking action, and backs it with a host of secondary offerings, including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average mid-80s slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering. Throwing strikes has never been a problem for Honeywell, whose natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently.  Honeywell is a fearless competitor on the mound, and he receives raves for his ability to mix pitches, set up hitters and execute a game plan. The Rays are hopeful that Honeywell will be able to return to the mound in the Minors sometime in May or June, though it's fair to assume that the club will exercise extra caution if needed. Provided he's healthy, it shouldn't take Honeywell long to pitch his way up the Majors.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AAA\"","6","\"2014 Draft Rnd 2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.6\"","\"56.3\"","\"53.1\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","2.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2600","45","60","60","50","","45","55","55","60","65","55","","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","45","55","","","65","60","\"LAN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["47","47","36","38","76","\"54.9\"","\"54.2\"","\"55.0\"","\"53.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"53.8\"","\"|\"","\"A.J.\"","\"Puk\"","2019","\"24.1\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"79\"","\"238\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","343","640462","\"puk_aj\"","","\"sa738675\"","\"|\"","29","\"Florida\"","-1","0","","\"High\"","2019","55","\"dF78XZniyhY\"","\"He was often frustrating at Florida, heavily reliant on velocity and a dominant slider while the rest lagged behind, but Puk seemed ready to ascend last year before he blew out his elbow. \"","\"It's counterintuitive to call a lefty with a plus slider and mid-90s velocity a 'breakout' candidate, but that's exactly what Puk looked like during 2018 Spring Training before he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John.

Additionally, Puk dusted off his high school curveball and reintroduced it to his repertoire. His feel for it returned very quickly, and it was comfortably average near the end of spring and gave him a fresh way of starting off at-bats the second and third time through a lineup. His changeup was also better than it had been in college, and looked like a potential plus pitch.   Scouts thought he had a chance to reach Oakland by year's end, and a surprisingly competitive Oakland club would have been motivated to move him quickly.

An inconsistent junior year dropped him from the top spot, but the A's were happy to take him with the sixth overall selection and gave him just over $4 million to sign him. He made it to Double-A in his first full season and pitched in the Futures Game and seemed poised to make the leap to Oakland in 2018. He was derailed from the fast track when he needed Tommy John surgery last April.    In 2017, Puk led the Minors with his 13.2 strikeouts-per-nine, a testament to a full repertoire of outstanding stuff. He'll throw his fastball up to 96-97 mph and he uses one of the best sliders in the Minors, to miss a ton of bats. He mixes in a curveball and his changeup, once a distant fourth pitch, has become a devastating out pitch as well, flashing plus at times. He uses his 6-foot-7 frame very well, with excellent extension.    Puk had improved his ability to find the strike zone as his first full season wore on, though there might be a learning curve command-wise as he returns from elbow surgery.

His 2018 included eight sterling starts in Low-A and 11 very solid starts in Hi-A, all as a teenager.   Graterol has the making of a frontline starter, sitting 96-99 and hitting 100 mph often, mixing in a plus-flashing slider and a changeup that's above average at its best. He's a short strider and a bit of a dart-thrower, which is unusual for a pitcher that hits 100, but it helps Graterol throw more strikes than you would assume from a teenager hitting this kind of heat with an arm surgery in his past. The poor extension makes his velocity play lower than the radar gun readings, but with some incremental improvements in pitch execution and command, Graterol could shoot up our overall list, as he does more things like Sixto Sanchez than anyone else in the minors.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","","\"Aug. 29, 2014 - MIN\"","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  After signing in the summer of 2014 for just $150,000, Graterol pitched sparingly in the Dominican Summer League the following year, then missed all of 2016 because of Tommy John surgery. He eased his way back with a solid performance across two rookie levels in 2017, then really jumped on the prospect radar by excelling at two levels of full-season ball, topping 100 innings for the first time and helping Fort Myers win the Florida State League title in 2018.  Graterol's stuff continues to get better the more he matures and the further removed from surgery he gets. His fastball touches triple digits and will often sit in the 96-98 mph range, with an ability to maintain velocity deep into starts. Throwing with plenty of sink, Graterol misses bats and gets a ton of ground-ball outs off of his fastball. When he committed to throw the harder version of his slider, in the 87-89 mph range, it trended toward plus, but he would back off of it at times. Continued separation between that and his slower curve will help, as will further refinement of his changeup.  The right-hander filled up the strike zone in the Midwest League and was still pretty consistent up a level as a teenager, pointing to perhaps better-than-average control in the future. His stuff, command and strength all add to a big up arrow next to his name, with a future as a frontline starter a distinct possibility.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"AA\"","3","\"2014 J2 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"55.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0008-01-15","2100","2600","40","60","45","","50","","","50","65","55","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","45","50","60","","","","50","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["49","49","62","53","142","\"54.8\"","\"51.9\"","\"52.9\"","\"52.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"53.6\"","\"|\"","\"CJ\"","\"Abrams\"","2019","\"18.7\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"182\"","\"draft\"","405","8","\"|\"","2815","","\"abrams_cj\"","","","\"|\"","62","\"Blessed Trinity HS (GA)\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2023","50","","\"80 runner with feel to hit who is going to play up the middle, possibly at shortstop.

Abrams' speed and athleticism compare favorably to any of the top prep talents in the 2019 Draft, and he's also one of the better high school hitters available. He draws comparisons to Dee Gordon, though he has considerably more pop than the former batting and stolen-base champ.    Abrams has game-changing speed, uses his quickness to beat out bunts and grounders and has the instincts to develop into a premium basestealer. Gatorade's 2019 Georgia high school player of the year, he has a quick left-handed stroke and controls the bat very well, making consistent contact and using the entire field. While he won't be a slugger, he has looked a little more physical this spring and has the bat speed and deceptive strength to hit 10-15 homers on an annual basis.    The biggest question with Abrams is where he'll eventually make his defensive home. The Alabama recruit has solid arm strength and a chance to stick at shortstop, but he doesn't have the most fluid actions. He might fit better at second base or center field, and he played the latter position in deference to Bobby Witt Jr. on Team USA at the 18-and-under Pan American Championships in Panama last fall.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","","5","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","5","6","\"SDP\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"55.5\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","55","20","80","40","55","60","60","45","70","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","40","75","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["50","50","59","54","255","\"54.8\"","\"52.0\"","\"52.9\"","\"51.1\"","\"48.2\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","\"Dylan\"","\"Cease\"","2019","\"23.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","310","6","\"|\"","845","656302","\"cease_dylan\"","","\"sa829000\"","\"|\"","51","\"Milton HS (GA)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"QMBKB06eigI\"","\"A hard-throwing righty with a traditional 12-6 curveball, Cease still has control/command questions to answer before we're all-in.\"","\"Cease burst onto the scouting scene in 2013 when, as a junior in high school, he hit 96 mph and flashed an above average curveball at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament in Cary, NC. He mostly held serve in his senior year, occasionally touching a tick or two higher or flashing 60 with his curveball, but was still a stuff over command type. The Cubs went well overslot to get Cease in the sixth round with a $1 million bonus, below what his talent was worth, but appropriate since clubs knew he needed Tommy John surgery right after he signed.   He's slowly made progress in terms of starter traits during his pro career, while his velocity has increased to where he sits 95-98 mph now. In 2018, he took the biggest step forward, dominating High-A and Double-A at age 22, and some scouts are now projecting him as a No. 2 or 3 starter. We still aren't completely convinced, as Cease is still control over command, and may fit best in a multi-inning relief role, or as a starter who doesn't face any hitters a third time. \"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","\"2014, 6th (169) - CHC\"","","2019","60","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 65 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 60  Cease had one of the best fastball/curveball combinations in the 2014 Draft and might have been a first-rounder as a Georgia high schooler if he hadn't injured his elbow that March. The Cubs still paid him $1.5 million as a sixth-rounder despite his pending Tommy John surgery, then brought him back slowly before including him in the Jose Quintana trade with the White Sox in July 2017. He took off in 2018, winning MLB Pipeline Pitcher of the Year honors after excelling in Double-A and placing fifth in the Minors in opponent average (.189) and eighth in strikeout rate (11.6 per nine innings).  Cease continues to dominate with his fastball and curveball. His quick arm generates 95-98 mph heaters that regularly creep into triple-digit territory with some sinking and running life. His curve has tremendous depth and some power as well, qualifying as a true hammer when it's on.  The rest of Cease's repertoire consists of a mid-80s slider/cutter that he started using more often in 2018, and a changeup that can become an average offering once it gets more consistent. He has streamlined his delivery since turning pro and is doing a better job of repeating it, as evidenced by the fact that his walk rate has improved each year. Control may never be his forte but he's providing enough strikes to project as a starter who can make an impact.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHW\"","\"AAA\"","5","\"2014 Draft Rnd 6 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"52.5\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","1.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2450","40","70","45","55","","","","45","70","50","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","50","65","50","","","","45","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["51","51","52","37","481","\"54.7\"","\"52.7\"","\"55.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"43.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Sean\"","\"Murphy\"","2019","\"24.6\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"232\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1689","669221","\"murphy_sean\"","","\"sa873680\"","\"|\"","33","\"Wright State\"","0","2","","\"High\"","2019","55","\"tVv3ORj53mQ\"","\"Murphy could be big league ready in the second half of 2019, has a 70 arm, and there's a shot he could be an above-average hitter with above-average power and defense.\"","\"Once a walk-on at Wright State, Murphy has become one of the more well-rounded catching prospects in the minors. He has always had near elite arm strength but because he didn't catch much pro-quality stuff in college, his receiving and ball-blocking were undercooked for a college prospect when he first entered pro ball. Those aspects of his defense have vastly improved, and he's now an average defender with a chance to be above, and his arm douses opposing baserunners.   Murphy also has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, a broken hamate likely masked his power and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. In pro ball, his swing has been very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He broke his other hamate last year. Murphy's nearly .500 SLG at Double-A Midland is above what we expect moving forward, and instead think Murphy will be a high-contact bat with doubles power, which would be an above-average regular behind the plate.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2016, 3rd (83) - OAK\"","","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 70 | Field: 65 | Overall: 55    In many respects, Murphy is already a huge success story. He went undrafted and lightly recruited out of high school, making Wright State as a preferred walk-on. He was a three-year, and much honored, starter there and was the second-highest pick in the program's history when the A's took him in the third round of the 2016 Draft, a spot he fell to because of a broken left hamate during his final collegiate season. He's turned into one of the better all-around catching prospects in the game, excelling in Double-A in 2018, though surgery on his other hamate in July shelved him for seven weeks. He was off to a strong start in Triple-A in 2019 when he once again hit the injured list, this time with a torn left meniscus that required surgery in early May.     Murphy has always stood out defensively. He's athletic and agile behind the plate, he blocks and receives well and gets high marks for his game-calling and ability to work with pitchers. He also has one of the strongest arms in the Minors, one that baserunners don't test too often and that has thrown out 35.5 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. He's a threat at the plate as well, with a short swing from the right side of the plate to go with a high contact rate. He's not afraid to draw walks and there could be 20-homer potential in the future.    Murphy will be a big leaguer based on his glovework alone, one who could be a defensive-minded starter.

Wilson fits in today's game because the concerns around him involve turning over the lineup and using his third pitch, but he normally has a plus fastball, above average command, plus plus makeup, and at least one average to above offspeed pitch, so he could be a great 2-3 inning reliever who works in various roles.

After leading the system in ERA in his first full season, he streaked across three levels of the Minors to make his big league debut in 2018, the first high schooler from his Draft class to do so.    Once upon a time, people saw Wilson as a future reliever because of his size, stuff and bulldog mentality. A former high school football player, Wilson goes right after hitters with his three-pitch arsenal. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but he's shown the ability to ratchet it up to 97-98 mph at times, and he throws it with a lot of sink to get ground-ball outs.

If you thought he would put on a good bit of weight, then you could see him adding velocity to his 88-92 mph heater. But the question was whether he would have enough stuff and durability to start if he stayed about the same size. He's filled out some since the Indians took him in the comp round in 2015, but it looks like he's always going to be very thin.   His velocity has crept up a bit to 90-93, hitting 95 mph, but the life, plane, deception, extension, and command combine to make the fastball an above average pitch now. The additional arm speed has helped his breaker improve; it flashes plus at times. And he's kept the positive attributes scouts originally noticed in his delivery and the athleticism, so the command may also end up being plus. The changeup is a 45, so his curve, pitchability, and deception are the carrying tools we think will turn him into a league average starter. McKenzie also had his first pro injury in 2018, and his strikeout rate was down in his first taste of Double-A, before he had upper back issues that have him on the shelf to start 2019.

The Indians have handled him carefully, limiting him to 95 1/3 innings in his first two pro seasons before turning him loose in 2017, when he was the Class A Advanced Carolina League pitcher of the year and finished second in the Minors with 186 strikeouts. After he came down with forearm soreness last spring, they delayed his 2018 debut until June, after which he looked like his usual dominant self.  Though McKenzie's fastball sits around 91-93 mph and tops out at 95, it projects as a plus pitch because he still has room to add more strength and velocity and because of his command, extension, angle and high spin rate. His curveball gives him a second plus offering, with good shape and spin rate to go with upper-70s velocity. His fading changeup helps him keep left-handers in check and grades as solid.  McKenzie's advanced feel for pitching stands out even more than his stuff. Even though he's still filling out his extra-long frame, he has no difficulty repeating his delivery and providing quality strikes.

He was arguably the best high school pitcher in the class, evaluated heavily early on by the Giants (who picked second), before settling into the 7-13 range by June. When Murray was selected, teams picking behind Oakland suddenly had access to one more player than they had anticipated. It meant Travis Swaggerty was there for Pittsburgh at 10, which meant Grayson Rodriguez was there for Baltimore at 11, and so on. Other teams hadn't considered the possibility that Libby would fall to them and either hadn't done a lot of background work, or weren't comfortable with how he might alter their bonus pool math. When Liberatore is at his best, he throws strikes with 93-97 for the first several innings of his starts, show you a 70 curveball, a good change, and alter the timing of his delivery to toy with hitters. He added a slider part way through his junior year and instantly had nascent feel for it. At other times, he'd sit 88-92 with scattershot command and get too cute with Johnny Cueto shenanigans. But the frame, athleticism, arm strength, and ability to spin are all ideal, and there's immense ceiling here.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2018, 1st (16) - TB\"","","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  Liberatore looked like a potential top Draft pick in 2018 after a stellar summer showcase circuit that concluded with him tossing six scoreless frames in the 18U U.S. National Team's gold-medal-winning game against Korea. While his stuff wasn't as electric during his senior year at Mountain Ridge (Ariz.) High, Liberatore still had a dominant campaign, going 8-1 with a 0.93 ERA and 104 strikeouts in 60 1/3 innings. When the Draft arrived, concerns about Liberatore's signability caused the Arizona commit to last until the mid-first round, where the Rays were thrilled to find him still available at the No. 16 overall pick. He signed for slightly below slot at $3,497,500, helping Tampa Bay save the money needed to sign fellow first-rounders Shane McClanahan and Nick Schnell, and he performed well during his pro debut at a pair of Rookie levels.  A 6-foot-5 left-hander, Liberatore stands out for his combination of stuff and pitchability, with the makings of three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale once fully developed. He sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph with a fastball that plays above its velocity because he's deceptive and gets such good extension over his front side. Liberatore's curveball is a swing-and-miss hammer, thrown with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate, and he introduced a new, and very effective, slider during the spring. His diving changeup, meanwhile, is another promising pitch, one that plays nicely off his heater and could be his best secondary offering when all is said and done.  After ranking as the top left-hander in his class and garnering consideration as a top-five overall pick, Liberatore now could end up as one of the 2018 Draft's biggest steals. While he's more advanced than most high school arms in his class and therefore could move comparatively faster than some of his peers, the Rays likely will bring Liberatore along slowly, as they usually do with their high school Draft picks, giving him the time he needs to develop physically and refine his craft.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"A\"","8","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.7\"","\"57.1\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.8333","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2050","2950","40","50","50","55","45","","","55","60","55","70","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","60","55","","","","55","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["55","55","98","138","148","\"54.2\"","\"50.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"52.4\"","\"48.9\"","\"52.7\"","\"|\"","\"Deivi\"","\"Garcia\"","2019","\"20.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"69\"","\"163\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","2230","665620","","","\"sa916944\"","\"|\"","64","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2021","50","\"TtDspHp7TRI\"","","\"At this time last year, Garcia was a 40 FV and an interesting prospect to monitor. He was a slightly-built, shorter righty with a knockout fastball/curveball combination, who was moved very quickly as Garcia saw 2017 action in the DSL, GCL, and Appy league levels at age 18. We were eager to see if he could continue to perform like that in full-season ball as a 19-year-old and boy, did he. Garcia had an xFIP under 3.00 at each of his three stops last year: eight Low-A starts, five in Hi-A (one of which is the linked video), and one in Double-A. Garcia's changeup and command both ended up playing better than we expected, with his changeup regularly flashing average to above -- confirming he has starter's stuff -- and his command sufficient to deal with A-ball hitters. The concerns about his durability tied to his stature are still there. He's 5-foot-10 and anywhere from 163 to 175 pounds. He threw 74.0 innings last year and even scouts who love Garcia concede he may not be a 170 to 200-inning type of arm. Instead, he may be in the Rich Hill or Lance McCullers mold, where you'll get 125 - 135 innings and hopefully have him healthy enough to fill whatever role fits the staff best in the playoffs. Hill and McCullers are 55 or 60 FV types, so that's likely Garcia's upside if things break right.   Garcia is a very good athlete, which is what allows him to repeat his delivery, throw so many strikes, and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire, recoil, and effort at release. We're hesitant to knock Garcia's delivery simply because it's unusual, or due to his size, because his performance at this age has also been remarkable. He has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone, and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball, which has been over 3000 rpm at times. A well-located fastball up, a high-spin curveball down, and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo, and Garcia knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters. There's some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level, but again, we would bet on Garcia figuring out how to make it work. He'll open 2019 in Double-A and could be good enough to crack the Bombers bullpen late in the season.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - NYY\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  After spending $18.1 million on the 2014 international market, the Yankees were restricted to giving out bonuses of no more than $300,000 the following summer, yet they still landed a pair of quality pitching prospects in Dominican right-handers Garcia ($200,000) and Luis Medina ($280,000). While Medina has louder stuff, Garcia has much more polish and used it to rush from low Class A to Double-A in only three months at age 19 last year. He struck out 12 in seven perfect innings in the second game of a Class A Advanced doubleheader on Aug. 6, though his Tampa team lost the game (but not the no-hitter) in the eighth.   Garcia's best pitch is a high-spin curveball with so much depth that he'll have to prove he can land it for strikes when more advanced hitters don't chase it out of the zone as often. He also gets good spin on his fastball, which plays better than its 91-96 mph velocity with deceptive riding life. He made strides with his fading changeup in 2018, creating optimism that it can become at least a solid third offering.  Though he doesn't have the smoothest delivery, Garcia repeats it well and exhibits advanced control and command for such a young pitcher. Because he's small and works with some effort, there are some concerns about his long-term durability as a starter, but his athleticism and efficiency help his cause. His fastball/curveball combination should play well in the late innings if he winds up as a reliever.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"AA\"","1","\"2015 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.1667","1.0","1.0","1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2750","45","55","40","60","","","","50","55","50","65","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","60","","","","","55","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["56","56","55","35","496","\"54.2\"","\"52.2\"","\"55.0\"","\"49.4\"","\"35.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Ronny\"","\"Mauricio\"","2019","\"18.2\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"166\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1948","677595","","","\"sa3006887\"","\"|\"","39","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","55","\"NvOA8y_cZGI\"","\"This is what Fernando Tatis, Jr. looked like at age 17.\"","\"Much of scouting teenage prospects has to do with identifying good athletes and good frames, and like many of this century's All-Star, power-hitting shortstops, Ronny Mauricio is both.

He may outgrow shortstop but if he does, it means big power on a plus-gloved third baseman. We were surprised by Mauricio's GCL assignment, and then surprised further by both his admirable statistical performance there and his late-season promotion to Kingsport.

One was outfielder Adrian Hernandez, the other was Mauricio, who was ranked No. 10 on the international list and signed for $2.1 million. He was deemed advanced enough to make the jump straight to the United States for his 2018 professional debut, and he continued to surpass expectations by earning a promotion to the Appalachian League at age 17 after slashing .279/.307/.421 with 19 extra-base hits in the Gulf Coast League.  A switch-hitting shortstop, Mauricio projects better as a left-handed hitter, even though he had more success against southpaws in 2018. He's impressed evaluators with his combination of bat speed and raw power from a swing that works really well and should allow him to hit for both average and power. Mauricio's raw pop is already showing, and he's only going to add strength and tap into it more as he matures. His outstanding defensive actions, soft hands and plus arm strength will give him a chance to stick at shortstop, where he stands to offer the most value with his bat. And if his 6-foot-3 frame fills out and he needs to move off the position, Mauricio should have the offensive profile to fit at third base.  Mauricio looks a lot like former big leaguer Alfonso Soriano in terms of body type, though he profiles as a different type of player. Overall, he has as much upside as anyone in the organization, with a real chance to become an impact player on both sides of the ball.

He made the leap between his sophomore and junior years, growing into his athleticism and developing plus raw power along with above average defensive tools and arm strength. The defensive tools are especially rare for a catcher of Bart's size, as it's much easier for a more compact-framed player to excel behind the plate. Bart has the rare ability to slow the game down defensively and scouts rave about his makeup, game calling, and game preparation.   At the plate, Bart has big power and gets to it pretty often in games, particularly to his pull side, where he hit a majestic shot that was never found over the facade of the football complex in left field at Georgia Tech's stadium. But while he is exceptional behind the plate, Bart doesn't have the same ability to slow the game at it, however, with elevated strikeout rates in his draft year and just okay pitch selection. The bat speed is good and he doesn't have trouble against velocity, and some scouts point to his solid pro debut as evidence that Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around and developed some bad habits in college. Since literally everything else you could want except for contact is already present, most assume that Bart will figure out a way to get to a 40 to 50 bat with above average game power and above average defense, even if it's on the job in the big leagues in 2020. He broke his hand early in 2019 and will miss several weeks.

He continued to impress in his pro debut, finishing third in the short-season Northwest League with 13 homers despite playing just 45 games of a 76-game schedule.    Thanks to his bat speed, strength and leverage, Bart rivaled Alec Bohm (No. 3 overall to the Phillies) as the best right-handed power hitter in the 2018 Draft. He learned in college that he has natural power and doesn't have to swing for the fences, and he has the potential to produce 25 homers per season. With his controlled swing and improved plate discipline, he should hit for average to go with his pop.    Scouts were divided on Bart's ability to stay behind the plate when he was coming out of high school, but he has put those questions to rest. He lacks speed like most catchers but is relatively athletic for his position, moves well behind the plate and has made himself into a solid receiver.

Then he plateaued a bit and was sitting mostly 90-92 in short stints on the showcase circuit leading into his draft year. But right out of the gate the next spring, Rodriguez began running his heater up to 98, and was instantly in the first round conversation as soon as teams got in to watch him dominate pretty weak competition in Nacogdoches, TX. Rodriguez fits the mold of a first round prep righty, a player demographic increasingly perceived as risky on draft day. He has a big frame that remains relatively projectable, has big velocity and a great breaking ball, and shows other starter traits often enough that he projects as part of a rotation. Some scouts thought the changeup and command would progress, but not be weapons of their own; they had Rodriguez toward the back of the first round. Others thought the curveball and slider both flashed plus and didn't care about the change, or thought his delivery only needed small tweaks.

That progress endeared Rodriguez to the Orioles' scouting department, and the club selected the Texas A&M commit with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. He signed for $4.3 million, then began his pro career by posting six straight scoreless outings in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.  Rodriguez showed that he could run his fastball up to 97-98 mph as a high school senior, but typically sits more in the 92-94 mph range with heavy life. Most scouts prefer his relatively new low-80s slider, a potential plus pitch, to his mid-70s curveball, although the latter has nice shape and he repeats its release point well. Rodriguez didn't have much need for a changeup in high school but shows the potential to have an average one.  With his 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot, Rodriguez creates steep downhill plane with his pitches and already shows a propensity for getting ground balls. He's a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that enables him to flood the zone with quality strikes. Those qualities could help Rodriguez move faster than the typical high school hurler, especially if he can make progress with his changeup and curveball.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"A\"","4","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"54.3\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2700","40","60","40","55","55","","","50","60","50","60","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","60","","","","50","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["59","59","49","34","318","\"54.1\"","\"53.0\"","\"55.0\"","\"50.6\"","\"43.7\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jasrado\"","\"Chisholm\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","1619","665862","","","\"sa919327\"","\"|\"","31","\"Bahamas\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","55","\"ir2kVOIT4mE\"","\"Chisholm hit 25 homers and swiped 17 bags last year.

But while Fox was the more touted amateur prospect and signed with the Giants for $6 million, it's been Chisholm who has blossomed into the better pro prospect since signing for $200,000. After a torn right meniscus derailed his first full season and limited him to just 29 games, Chisholm bounced back to club 25 home runs in 2018, leading all Minor League shortstops. He finished his age-20 season with a torrid stretch in the California League, hitting 10 homers in 36 games following a promotion, and then tied a bow on his breakout year with an impressive showing in the Arizona Fall League.  Chisholm posts impressive exit velocities from the left side of the plate with an explosive swing that has natural loft. He showed in 2018 that he not only could tap into his plus raw power, but also apply it across the entire field, as some of Chisholm's longest home runs were hit to straightaway center. Chisholm's power does come with swing-and-miss tendencies, so he'll need to refine his aggressive approach as he develops. He's an above-average runner who receives praise for his instincts on the basepaths.   There is little question Chisholm can stay at shortstop, with good hands and actions to go along with a strong arm and a knack for making highlight-reel plays on a nightly basis.

High School as a freshman, Hall transferred to Houston County High (Warner Robins, Ga.) in 2016 and helped the program win a 5-A state title. He returned to Valdosta for his senior year, established himself as one of the top left-handed pitchers ahead of the 2017 Draft and became the fourth southpaw to come off the board when the Orioles took him with the No. 21 overall pick. He signed for above slot at $3 million.

Hall already pitches with a plus fastball, sitting at 92-94 mph and reaching 96, with late life that makes the pitch difficult to barrel. His curveball is above average but can flash plus, thrown with a high spin rate that gives it late bite, and the same can be said about the fading changeup he's made strides in developing. Meanwhile, that he does a good job repeating his simple delivery and knows how to find his release point with each pitch suggests he could develop above-average command.  The Orioles kept Hall on a tight leash during his first full season and never allowed him to throw more than 90 pitches in a start. While the training wheels should come off a bit more going forward, it wouldn't be surprising if the club employed a similar approach to managing Hall's workload in 2019.

A plus-running, backwards guy (he bats right and throws left, a generally unfavorable combination due to the defensive limitations and platoon issues caused by both) who plays plus defense at first base, White was slugging .391 at the start of August, which is rather uninspiring for a college hitter in the Cal League. By the end of the month, however, White had 30 hits in 90 plate appearances and was slugging .763.   He has made subtle changes to his lower half, drawing his front knee back toward his rear hip more than he did at Kentucky, and taking a longer stride back toward the pitcher. White is more often finishing with a flexed front leg, which has helped him go down and lift balls in the bottom part of the strike zone by adjusting his lower half instead of his hands. White looked good during the Arizona Fall League, too, squelching some concern that he was just a polished college hitter beating up on Cal League pitching.

That allowed him to become the second-highest drafted player from the program, after Chad Green, and he went on to have a solid first full season, spent in the California League, and capped it off with a stint in the Arizona Fall League.    Because of White's advanced approach at the plate, a willingness to draw walks and the ability to make consistent hard contact, few question his ability to hit. He's already shown the ability to send line drives to all fields, and an adjustment he made late in 2018, lowering his hands in his setup, started to allow him to create leverage and tap into his raw power more effectively, as he slugged over .700 in August. White runs very well and has a strong arm, and showed he's more than capable in the outfield during his time with Team USA before his junior year.    A move to the outfield, however, would take the best defensive first baseman in the Minors away from his natural position. His footwork, range and hands led to some evaluators bringing him up as one of the best defensive prospects, period, in the game. He has the chance to be a Gold Glover, and with his new adjustments at the plate, he could have more of the prototypical offensive profile for the position than people expected.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AA\"","4","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.5\"","\"55.9\"","\"53.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","50","60","60","55","55","50","50","55","70","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","60","55","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["63","63","48","33","209","\"54.0\"","\"53.1\"","\"55.0\"","\"51.7\"","\"39.8\"","\"52.8\"","\"|\"","\"Nolan\"","\"Gorman\"","2019","\"19.1\"","\"3B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","320","6","\"|\"","2392","669357","\"gorman_nolan\"","","\"sa3007017\"","\"|\"","43","\"O'Connor HS (AZ)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","55","\"_2qk0vq7IEA\"","\"A teenage third baseman with middle-of-the-order power, Gorman's built like a pass-rushing outside linebacker and may eventually have to move off third base.\"","\"Gorman mashed goof pitching as an underclassman and was universally regarded as one of the two safest high school hitters in the 2018 class until he suddenly started swinging over the top of mediocre high school breaking balls as a senior. In addition to those troublesome strikeouts, he looked less agile on defense than he had the previous summer. Teams generally thought these issues were correctable but they, and a few odd draft day dominoes, contributed to his slide back to the 19th overall pick. After signing, Gorman paved over the Appalachain League (.350/.443/.664) and received a very aggressive promotion to Low-A, where he struggled to make contact. Gorman's hand path is similar to Kyle Seager's and that loop creates power, but also some length, so there's some hit-related risk here.

The Cardinals were thrilled to find him still available with the 19th overall pick and signed Gorman for full pick value, just over $3.2 million. He showcased his prodigious power by swatting 17 home runs in 63 games during an impressive pro debut that included a promotion to the Class A Midwest League.  Gorman has light-tower power from the left side of the plate, with some scouts giving his raw power a 70-grade on the 20-to-80 scale. That power does come with some holes in his swing and leads to some swing-and-miss tendencies, but there's no denying that Gorman has ultra-quick hands and bat speed. He proved that he could make hard contact against good competition over the summer (when pitchers weren't avoiding him) and continued to do so during his pro debut, all while demonstrating a quality approach.  Some evaluators wonder whether Gorman will remain a third baseman on account of his rigid actions and the likelihood of decreased mobility as he matures physically. He does have the arm strength for the position, however, and is praised for his instincts. If Gorman can continue to refine his approach enough to tap into that power consistently, he has the chance to perfectly fit the profile of a run-producing third baseman in the middle of a big league lineup.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"A\"","1","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"36.4\"","\"53.6\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","20","30","70","40","40","50","50","60","70","40","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","40","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["64","64","69","87","130","\"53.9\"","\"51.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"52.7\"","\"47.5\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Nick\"","\"Lodolo\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"78\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","400","8","\"|\"","1746","","\"lodolo_nick\"","","","\"|\"","109","\"TCU\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2021","50","\"pIYt1wwMfI0\"","\"Didn't sign as Pirates' 1st rounder out of high school and showed almost no improvement during freshman and sophomore years, but reports from Fall 2018 were strong and he has broken out as many anticipated.

Everything clicked for him during an early-season college tournament in Houston, where Lodolo worked in the mid-90s with a plus breaking ball and changeup. He generally sits 92-94, but he is lanky 6-foot-6, so it plays up a bit due to extension. He's more apt to throw his curveball for strikes rather than bury it in the dirt for swings and misses, but he showed better grasp of the latter late in the year. While Lodlo will sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups, there have been stretches where it's his best pitch. His frame is ideal, his delivery elegant and repeatable.

Lodolo usually works at 90-94 mph and peaks at 96 with sink on his fastball, using his 6-foot-6 frame to deliver it on a steep downhill plane. He showed inconsistent feel for spinning a curveball in the past and is focusing instead on a tighter slider in the low 80s that has become a solid offering. He also sells his changeup well and it has good action at the plate, giving him three pitches that all can grade as plus at their best.  Lodolo has a long, lean body that could add more strength and an easy delivery. He's doing a better job of maintaining his three-quarters arm slot, resulting in improved control and command.

The Astros popped him in the second round in 2017, hoping to tease out the guy they saw on the Cape and in the last 18 months, they've done just that.   Martin sits in the mid-90s, mixes in a plus slider, with an above average changeup and average command. He still doesn't post the strikeout rates that you'd assume from a possible No. 2 or 3 starter in the Astros farm system, which annually leads the minors in strikeouts in part because they know how to coach pitchers to make the most of their stuff. Sources with knowledge in this area indicate that Martin should see more K's in 2019 if he can make a couple subtle adjustments to how he uses his pitches and fully unlock his potential, which could lead to a big league look at the end of 2019 if the vaunted Astros pitching staff has an open spot.\"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","\"2017, 2nd (56) - HOU\"","","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  During his college career, Martin alternated inconsistency with flashes of dominance while shuttling between roles at Texas A&M with dominating as a reliever in summer leagues. He flashed first-round stuff at times but was available to the Astros in the second round of the 2017 Draft with a pick they received from the Cardinals as punishment for a hacking scandal. He reached Double-A a month into his first full pro season and thrived there, showing the best combination of stuff and polish among Houston's stockpile of upper-level starting pitching prospects.  Martin's arsenal begins with a 92-95 mph fastball that hits 97 with running action, and he has reached the upper 90s while working in relief. He can miss bats with each of his breaking balls, with his slider showing more flashes of becoming a true plus offering than his curveball. His changeup continues to improve as he uses it more often and helped make him slightly more effective against lefties than righties in 2018.  Though Martin had trouble sticking in the Aggies rotation, he has looked like a slam-dunk starter since signing for a below-slot $1 million.

He was sitting 92-96 as a rising sophomore on Cape Cod, but often sat 90-94, and sometimes 88-91, throughout his starts the following spring. While we anticipate a rebound -- and Gilbert has been 94-97 in bullpens and simulated environments this spring -- college starters often experience a slight downturn in velo because they're being asked to go every fifth day for five months instead of once a week for three and a half. While there's a wide array of potential outcomes for Gilbert's fastball, his command, breaking ball quality, prototypical frame, and mechanical consistency have been stable.

Gilbert, whom the Mariners took in the middle of the first round after a slightly up-and-down junior season as he pitched through a bout of mono, hopes to be the next in line after Corey Kluber and Jacob deGrom. The right-hander didn't pitch at all in his first summer as a pro after signing for full pick value.  Gilbert has a strong track record of using a solid four-pitch mix and throwing them all for strikes. He showed just what he's capable of when 100 percent healthy while winning Atlantic Sun Pitcher of the Year honors as a sophomore, then being named a Cape Cod League All-Star that summer. He sat in the mid-90s, touching 97 mph on the Cape and then saw his velocity dip while he was sick, though it ticked back up closer to Draft time. He's gotten bigger and more physical this offseason, so don't be surprised to see some 70-grade fastballs in there in 2019. He can throw two distinct breaking balls, with the harder slider better than the curve, and can mix in an effective changeup as well.

What sort of hitter Riley becomes is more a matter of choice for him, but we think he'll end up in the .250 average, with an average OBP and plus game power, meaning 25 homers or so annually. \"","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","\"2015, CBA (41) - ATL\"","","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 40 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55    Back in 2015, Riley was a two-way high school standout ranked 106th on MLB Pipeline's Draft Top 200 who most teams preferred as a pitcher. The Braves liked his bat, took him well ahead of where the scouting industry had him pegged and sent him out as a third baseman. It's looking like a shrewd decision as Riley slugged his way to Triple-A at age 21 in 2018.    Riley's raw power is legitimate and he's already shown an ability to tap into it, with two 20-homer seasons and then 19 more in 2018, despite missing a good chunk of the season with a knee injury. He's a better hitter than people thought when he entered pro ball, though there's a considerable amount of swing and miss to his game. He doesn't chase out of the zone very often, but does need to improve on his contact rate on pitches in the strike zone. He worked with hitting instructor Mike Brumley at instructs last fall to make some mechanical tweaks to hopefully lead to more consistent contact. The Braves will live with strikeout totals, but know that not missing his pitch more consistently will lead to even better power production.    Riley made huge changes in his conditioning early in his career and has stuck with it, making him much lighter and more agile. That's translated to his defensive play at third, where the Braves feel he has the chance to even be an above-average defender with a plus arm. He's close to knocking on the door and it will be interesting to watch how the Braves try to get his power into their lineup soon.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ATL\"","\"MLB\"","2","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (ATL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"47.7\"","\"52.7\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","45","70","45","45","65","45","60","70","40","50","65","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","40","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["70","70","102","137","161","\"53.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"52.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"52.5\"","\"|\"","\"Josh,Joshua\"","\"James\"","2019","\"26.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","200","4","\"|\"","2384","657624","","16794","\"sa829673\"","\"|\"","98","\"Western Oklahoma JC\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2019","50","","\"James' velocity has climbed in each of the last few years and he carved up Triple-A before getting a big league look late last season.

He struck out 171 hitters in 114 innings at Triple-A Fresno in 2018 before the Astros brought him to the big leagues for six appearances (some out of the bullpen, some as a starter), and he struck out more than a batter per inning there, as well. He was slated to compete for a spot in Houston's rotation during the spring but was sidelined with a quad strain, and may begin the regular season rehabbing or in a lesser role due to the late start.  James' secondaries can sometimes be easy to identify out of his hand, but purely based on movement, they're both plus.

He then reclassified and was suddenly on track to graduate and be draft eligible a year early, meaning every decision-making amateur evaluator in the country had to get in quickly to see a pitcher who had all this new velocity but with whom scouts had very little history. Then Bukauskas asked not to be drafted (he was, late, and didn't sign) so he could go to North Carolina. After a middling freshman year, he was dominant as a sophomore and in the early part of his junior year before his stuff was depressed during North Carolina's postseason games. It inflamed perviously held concerns that durability issues resulting from his size and a violent delivery might push Bukauskas to the bullpen.   After parts of two pro seasons, we still don't have great feel for how Bukauskas will hold up under a pro workload. He hasn't had any arm issues, but missed two months due to a slipped disk in his thoracic spine, an injury he suffered in a car accident. Bukauskas was electric when he returned and became increasingly dominant towards the end of the summer before his stuff was seen by the entire industry in the Arizona Fall League.   He'll flash 70-grade changeups and sliders on occasion, bump 98, and has added a cutter. His stuff would lose some zip late in Fall League outings, and he may be more of a 120-inning starter than true workhorse, which would cap his value at around 2.5 annual WAR.\"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","\"2017, 1st (15) - HOU\"","","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 65 | Cutter: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  Bukauskas' velocity and prospect status took off in 2014, when he reclassified from a high school junior to a Draft-eligible senior, yet he turned down early-round overtures from clubs in order to attend North Carolina. Many scouts believed his fastball and slider were the best combination of pitches in the 2017 Draft, where he went 15th overall and signed for $3.6 million. An automobile accident in his first Spring Training left him with a slipped disc and limited him to three appearances in the first three months of the 2018 season, but his overpowering stuff was apparent down the stretch and in the Arizona Fall League.  Bukauskas' best offering is his slider, which combines mid-80s power with late, sharp bite, though he can fall in love with it and lose some feel for his fastball. His heater is also formidable, sitting in the mid-90s, topping out at 98 mph and featuring some sink and run. He flashed a plus changeup with fade in the AFL, though he needs to throw it more often to improve its consistency, and he also can mix in a cutter.  The debate over whether Bukauskas is better suited to be a starter or reliever dates to his high school days. He has settled down his delivery somewhat since then but still throws with effort, and his lack of size and reliable command could point him toward the bullpen. He could move very fast in a relief role, though others see him as a Sonny Gray type.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"AA\"","5","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"52.1\"","\"56.4\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.3333","0.0000","1.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2600","2550","45","60","55","","60","55","","50","60","60","","70","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","55","","65","50","","","45","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["72","72","79","81","208","\"53.2\"","\"51.2\"","\"51.4\"","\"51.7\"","\"47.3\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","\"Yusniel\"","\"Diaz\"","2019","\"22.6\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1069","666783","","","\"sa912848\"","\"|\"","92","\"Cuba\"","1","2","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"cdLpzBiXeNQ\"","\"The Manny Machado trade centerpiece, Diaz is a well-rounded corner outfield prospect who should debut in 2019.\"","\"Diaz was a prominent and expensive part of the Dodgers '15-'16 international spending spree that is now the subject of a Department of Justice investigation. He signed for a $15 million bonus -- the Dodgers paid a dollar-for-dollar tax on his deal for exceeding their pool limit -- during a CBA era that was more lucrative for international players. So advanced was Diaz that at age 19, the Dodgers saw fit to send him directly to Hi-A Rancho Cucamonga the following year, and he performed admirably for what amounted to a season and a half before enjoying a statistical breakout at Double-A Tulsa starting late in 2017. His stock and performance reached a pinnacle in 2018; Diaz slashed .314/.428/.477 with Tulsa, homered twice and won MVP at the Futures Game in July. Shortly thereafter he was traded to Baltimore as the headline prospect in the Manny Machado deal.   Diaz has a well-rounded collection of average tools that, in aggregate, promise to make him a valuable everyday big leaguer. He has slowly whittled down what was once a pretty big leg kick into something more simplistic, and it seems to have benefitted Diaz's timing without subtracting from his power. He can open up and get the bat head on pitches in, and he has feel for opposite-field contact if he's a little late on something away from him. We'd be surprised if Diaz became a 3-plus win annual WAR producer, but we think he's a very stable everyday outfield prospect who'll be big league ready in the next year and a half or so.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","","\"Nov. 21, 2015 - LAD\"","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  The Dodgers shelled out a total of $31 million to sign Diaz in November 2015, spending $15.5 million on the then-18-year-old's signing bonus and the other half to cover the team's incurred penalty tax. He reached Double-A for the first time two years later and then showed across-the-board improvement in his return to the level in 2018, earning a selection to the Futures Game, where he showcased his talents to a national audience by hitting a pair of impressive home runs. Just a few days later, the Orioles acquired Diaz along with four other prospects in a 5-for-1 deal for Manny Machado.  Diaz stands out most for his pure hitting ability, but each of his five tools has the potential to be average or better. Whether he will hit for power is perhaps the biggest question mark in his offensive profile, as Diaz has never hit more than 11 home runs in three professional seasons. He showed more pop in 2018 after toning down his setup and incorporating his lower half more, and with a more consistent launch angle, Diaz has the strength to produce at least average game power. He's tightened his approach at every level, showing more patience and a discerning eye en route to improved strikeout and walk rates.  Though he's an average runner, Diaz has been successful in just 44.4 percent of his stolen base attempts (28-of-63) as a pro and likely will lose a step with physical maturation. He's capable of playing center field in a pinch but is best-suited long term for right field. The Orioles were thrilled with how amenable Diaz was to making improvements upon joining the organization and then during instructional league. With further refinement, he could develop into a middle-of-the-order run producer who hits for both average and power.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","3","\"2015 J2 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"52.7\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","2.0","-1.0","\"|\"","45","40","50","50","50","55","55","50","50","50","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","50","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["73","73","88","136","87","\"53.1\"","\"50.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"53.3\"","\"48.7\"","\"53.8\"","\"|\"","\"Jose\"","\"Suarez\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"70\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1059","660761","","19911","\"sa872545\"","\"|\"","90","\"Venezuela\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"ePgdXSuhTp4\"","\"Suarez experienced a velocity spike last year and now has a strong three-pitch mix.

MLB teams had interest in Kikuchi when he was a teenager and several of them courted him before he was drafted into NPB. Though minor ailments limited his early-career workload, he's been one of the better starters in Japan for the last six years and has been especially good for the last two, before Saitama posted him. He started getting into pitch design after his parent club installed a TrackMan unit in 2016.   Like a lot of Japanese pitchers, Kikuchi has a kitchen sink repertoire that features a splitter and various breaking balls. Everything is above-average, except for Kikuchi's fastball. Mechanically, Kikuchi is similar to MacKenzie Gore, although his stride direction is more direct to the plate and his delivery has a brief intermission as his landing leg descends (pause) then everything comes home. His arm action is efficient and Kikuchi's slot is vertical, something it seems that more analytically inclined teams prefer. He sounds like a mid-rotation starter who, for our purposes, will enter his decline phase earlier than everyone else on this list because of his age.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"MLB\"","2","\"2018 Free Agent (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.7\"","\"50.7\"","","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.3333","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2800","45","50","","60","","55","55","45","50","","60","","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["78","78","81","79","178","\"53.0\"","\"51.1\"","\"51.4\"","\"52.1\"","\"43.9\"","\"52.8\"","\"|\"","\"Luis\"","\"Garcia\"","2019","\"19.0\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1574","671277","","","\"sa962605\"","\"|\"","50","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2021","50","","\"See Gimenez, Andres.\"","\"In the Nationals' budget-busting 2016 international signing class, Garcia ($1.3 million) was the lesser-paid and, until close to signing day, lesser-regarded prospect when compared to Yasel Antuna ($3.9 million).

Houston took things slow for the first year 10 months, and left Alvarez in the DSL in 2016 and in Extended Spring Training to start 2017, but he has moved very quickly since then, climbing to a new minor league level every half season. And he has performed. Alvarez is a career .301/.381/.507 hitter in the minors, has always been young relative to his level, and reached Triple-A last year shortly after he turned 21. He has big, all-fields raw power, and balls he mis-hits will often still find their way to the warning track. While Alvarez has good natural timing in the box and isn't often fooled by breaking stuff, he does have limited bat control and we anticipate his batting averages will be lower in majors than they have been thus far.   Athletic for his size, Alvarez has mostly played left field as a pro and he's a 40 runner underway, but he appeared to stiffen last year and most teams have him projected to first base or DH. That will limit his overall value and makes his lack of bat control a little scary, but we still think Alvarez will become an average regular, and possibly get an opportunity quite soon.\"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","","\"June 15, 2016 - LAD\"","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 45 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  The Dodgers signed Alvarez for $2 million in June 2016 and sent him to the Astros a month later -- before he had made his pro debut -- in a deadline deal for Josh Fields. Despite Fields' effectiveness as a regular-season reliever, that deal could be doubly regrettable for Los Angeles because he gave up two runs in Game 2 of the 2017 World Series to help set Houston on a path to its first championship and Alvarez has become one of the game's best offensive prospects. He batted .299/.374/.507 in his first two full pro seasons while swiftly advancing to Triple-A.  Though he's a big man at 6-foot-5 and 225 pounds, Alvarez has a relatively compact swing for his size and makes repeated hard contact to all fields. His bat speed, strength, leverage and loft in his left-handed stroke give him tremendous natural pop and he understands that he doesn't have to swing for the fences to hit home runs. He has good feel for the barrel and understands the strike zone, so he should hit for average as well as power.  While Alvarez is more athletic than many players his size, he's not going to provide a lot of value beyond his bat. He can flash solid speed once he gets going but projects as a below-average runner as he continues to mature physically. The Astros believe he's a better defender in left field, where he has a fringy arm, than at first base, where scouts from other clubs think he'll eventually wind up.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"MLB\"","4","\"2015 J2 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"43.2\"","\"52.7\"","\"49.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","2.0","1.0","\"|\"","45","30","65","45","30","45","55","55","65","40","40","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","45","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["81","80","125","155","105","\"52.8\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"53.0\"","\"51.1\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Zac\"","\"Gallen\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"191\"","\"professional\"","280","6","\"|\"","1742","668678","\"gallen_zac\"","","\"sa857550\"","\"|\"","118","\"North Carolina\"","1","1","","\"Low\"","2019","50","","","\"Viewed as a low-ceiling pitchability arm in college, Gallen reached Double-A just one calendar year after he was drafted by St. Louis, which traded him to Miami in the Marcel Ozuna deal the following winter.

It helped Gallen miss more bats, and he struck out a batter per inning at Triple-A New Orleans. Realistically, Gallen will pitch at the back of a rotation as a No. 4 or 5 starter because nothing he throws is plus and it's hard to envision him striking out many major league hitters.

Gallen spent all of 2018 in Triple-A, ranking second in the Pacific Coast League with a 3.65 ERA and 136 strikeouts.  Regarded as a back-of-the-rotation starter, Gallen gets results without plus stuff. His upper-80s cutter has been his bread-and-butter pitch, and he works it to both sides of the plate with the ability to backdoor it for strikes against left-handers. His low-90s fastball tops out at 94 but plays up because he creates downward plane and commands his heater well.  Gallen also keeps hitters off balance by varying the speed on his changeup and curveball, with the latter a slightly better offering.

He is an old, reflective soul with an adolescent's enthusiasm for baseball in the body of a Division I tight end. Because Rodriguez spent his 2018 summer in the DSL (which isn't heavily scouted) and Seattle eschews game action during instructional league, if people in baseball wanted a look at Rodriguez they sought out the highlight clips he would upload to his Instagram account. He hit .315/.404/.525 in the DSL, so there were plenty of those. His feed is also full of group photos with other young prospects and several big leaguers, all of whom Rodriguez is taller than.   The convergence of his physical, technical, and seeming emotional maturity have caused Seattle to publicly consider skipping Rodriguez over the AZL and Northwest League in favor of sending him right to their new Low-A affiliate in Charleston, West Virginia as a young 18-year-old. The cultural assimilation curve may be steep, but Rodriguez is talented enough to have on-field success there. His approach is quiet and would appear contact-oriented if not for his prodigious natural strength, which turns would-be flare singles into gap doubles, and causes mis-hit flyouts to threaten the warning track. He could end up with a plus bat and plus power, plenty to profile in an outfield corner, hit in the middle of a good order, and perhaps be a perennial All-Star. The Kelenic/Rodriguez duo is refined enough that they each might be promoted at a pace that more closely mimics college players than recently-acquired teenagers, which would enable them to have more big league overlap with the crop of twenty-somethings the org acquired in the Paxton/Diaz deals.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - SEA\"","2022","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55    &#8226; <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mariners-see-two-top-prospects-injured\">4/19: Rodriguez to miss 4-6 weeks with hairline fracture in left hand</a>  Ramirez was in the top 10 of MLB Pipeline's Top 30 international prospect list for the 2017-18 signing period and the Mariners wasted no time, signing the outfielder for $1.75 million on the first day of the period.

He has an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, and has displayed excellent raw power from the get-go. Rodriguez has changed tremendously physically -- in a good way -- since he signed and is now a physical beast, one the organization thinks might have 70 raw power. While he might lose a step as he continues to mature, he's athletic enough for a corner outfield spot with an arm suitable for right.

The Pirates nabbed him at No. 12, gave him $4.1 million, a bit over-pick value, to sign him away from a TCU commitment and then sent him to the Gulf Coast League for his pro debut. He moved up to Rookie-level Bristol of the Pioneer League in 2018 and was pitching well there when the Pirates sent him to the Rays in August as the player to be named later in the trade for Chris Archer.  With his deep, high-octane arsenal and physical projection, Baz has a very high ceiling. He'll sit at 92-96 mph and can reach back for 98 mph with his heater, throwing it with run and sink that nets him whiffs as well as a lot of weak, ground-ball contact. He can miss bats with a plus cutter that he can manipulate into a true slider, and he also spins a distinctly different curveball that will flash above-average. His changeup gives him another potential Major League-average pitch. While he does have some violence in his delivery, Baz has the athleticism and clean arm action needed to make significant gains with his control and command.  Patience will be key for Baz, and he's in good hands in a Rays organization that has a strong record of developing projectable young arms, with 2018 AL Cy Young winner Blake Snell representing their latest success story.

That turned him into a first-round pick and the Mets nabbed him at No. 19 overall. After struggling a bit in his first full season, the right-hander went back to the Florida State League and pitched his way to Double-A in 2018. The Mariners noticed the rebound and acquired him as part of the package for Robinson Cano and Edwin Diaz in December.    There hasn't been any issue with Dunn's stuff since he entered pro ball. He'll sit in the 93-95 mph range with his fastball and can reach back for more at times. He does have a pair of breaking balls, with his slider ahead of the curve. He'll throw the harder slider with good late bite and it looked like a plus pitch for him at its best in 2018. Dunn is still working to develop his changeup, though he shows some feel for it. He's made progress in getting left-handed hitters out, using that third pitch more effectively at times.    While Dunn's overall command and control have been inconsistent in his brief career, the Mariners feel they saw a better strike-thrower as he got settled in during his bounce-back 2018 campaign. He is athletic, which should help him repeat his delivery. Staying healthy helped Dunn take a nice step toward his ceiling as a mid-rotation big league starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AA\"","5","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.6\"","\"52.9\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2400","45","55","50","45","55","","","50","55","55","50","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","50","55","","","","50","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["85","84","141","151","110","\"52.5\"","\"49.7\"","\"49.3\"","\"52.9\"","\"39.2\"","\"54.2\"","\"|\"","\"Corbin\"","\"Carroll\"","2019","\"18.8\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"70\"","\"165\"","\"draft\"","379","8","\"|\"","2821","","\"carroll_corbin\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Lakeside HS (WA)\"","1","2","","\"Med\"","2023","47","\"sUghxoNDJ4g\"","\"Do-everything CF without prototypical size, more gap power than homers.\"","\"Carroll was electric during his showcase summer, displaying consistent, high-quality, all-fields contact and surprising power.

That perception changes once you see the Pacific Northwest high schooler play. Carroll hit at pretty much every stop on the summer showcase circuit last year, establishing himself as one of the top prep bats in the country. He's done nothing to diminish those evaluations this spring.    Carroll has one of the best overall approaches in the Draft, especially among high school hitters. He can spray the ball to all fields from the left side of the plate, but as he did most noticeably during his Perfect Game All-American Classic MVP performance, he can drive the ball with line-drive loft and surprising pop. His outstanding speed helps him on both sides of the ball, with the ability to steal bases and play an outstanding defensive center field.       The UCLA commit has drawn comparisons to hitters like Jacoby Ellsbury and Andrew Benintendi, slightly undersized left-handed hitters who grew into their power at the next level.

It's also clear that despite high-end velocity, Alcantara's fastball isn't going to miss that many bats. He's created greater demarcation in the movement between his four and two-seamers, that latter of which pairs well with his improving changeup, which now projects to be Alcantara's best secondary pitch. There's a strong chance he either ends up in relief due to issues with his fastball efficacy stemming from limited command and movement, but even if that's the case, he's a four-pitch reliever with two plus offerings, and that probably plays at the back of a bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"MLB\"","4","\"2013 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.6\"","\"52.1\"","","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2275","2400","40","65","55","45","55","","","45","65","60","50","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["87","86","97","74","378","\"52.5\"","\"50.6\"","\"51.4\"","\"50.1\"","\"44.7\"","\"50.6\"","\"|\"","\"Andres\"","\"Gimenez\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"161\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1085","665926","","","\"sa917114\"","\"|\"","49","\"Venezuela\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","50","\"0daljrqAYUs\"","\"More skilled and polished than he is toolsy, Gimenez has been pushed up the minor league ladder aggressively and performed. He perceived ceiling is not that high.\"","\"While evaluations of his defense are universally strong, assessments of Gimenez's bat vary significantly depending on when he was seen. He looked like a well-rounded, first-division player while he was hitting with pleasantly surprising power (.282/.343/.432 with 30 extra-base hits in 85 games) at Hi-A St. Lucie during the season's first half, but like much less of one during a rough six weeks in the Arizona Fall League. In Fall League, Gimenez looked physically overmatched at the plate, likely due to exhaustion. He was still 19 when the Mets promoted him to Double-A for the season's final six weeks, and his sophomoric body had endured a 122-game season against older, more physically developed athletes before he had even set foot in Arizona. It's fair to project Gimenez to add strength, but because his frame is small, it'll probably be just the kind of strength that gives him season-long stamina, not huge raw power. But while big raw power is unlikely, if his feel for contact is refined in a way that prioritizes lift, it's possible that Gimenez will end up hitting for more power than we project in the same way Ozzie Albies has. Gimenez has excellent natural bat control and can pull his hands in to get the barrel on pitches that would jam other hitters, and he has feel for fully extending on balls away from him and roping them into the opposite-field gap. If he does, he might end up hitting a ton of doubles and out-slug our projections without hitting a lot of home runs, or he may naturally start lifting the ball like Albies did. In general, we like Gimenez as an above-average defensive middle infielder with advanced contact skills. We think he'll be a solid-average everyday player, and while we think it's unlikely, we can see a developmental path that leads to better production than that.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - NYM\"","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 35 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 55    The Mets have never shied away from pushing young infielders up the organizational ladder if they felt they could handle the challenge, with players like Amed Rosario and Wilmer Flores making their big league debuts at age 21 in recent years. Gimenez, who signed in July 2015 for $1.2 million and made it to Double-A in 2018 before he turned 20, appears to be on a similar path.    Gimenez might be among the most unassuming-looking top prospects in the game given his small frame, but he has tools on both sides of the ball. He can flat-out play shortstop, and should be able to play there long-term thanks to his strong arm, excellent hands, range and plus instincts for the position. While he's not a burner, he has above-average speed, and he maximizes it both defensively and as a hitter, leading the organization in stolen bases in 2018. He has a very good approach at the plate that leads to consistent contact, and he's shown he's not afraid to draw a walk. He may never win a home run derby, but the 2018 Futures Gamer showed more extra-base thump in '18, with a bit more to come.    In another system, Gimenez would be the heir apparent at shortstop. With Rosario there in the big leagues, Gimenez got a lot of time at second base in the Arizona Fall League last fall, perhaps a sign of things to come.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2015 J2 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"43.6\"","\"51.4\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","30","40","60","50","55","55","45","45","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","60","35","55","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["88","87","60","75","75","\"52.5\"","\"51.9\"","\"51.4\"","\"53.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"53.8\"","\"|\"","\"Jon\"","\"Duplantier\"","2019","\"24.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1612","641541","\"duplantier_jon\"","19546","\"sa874168\"","\"|\"","98","\"Rice\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"mlEmgiI4CV0\"","\"Duplantier had injury issues in college and dealt with some in 2018 (hamstring, biceps tendinitis), but his stuff was fine in the fall when he was into the mid-90s with three good secondaries and a great idea of how to use them.\"","\"Duplantier had been injury free since college (when he dealt with shoulder problems), until 2018, when he had hamstring issues in the spring, and biceps tendinitis later in the summer. The lost innings resulted in an Arizona Fall League stint, during which Duplantier was arguably the best non-Whitley pitching prospect who was a lock to start. Despite the biceps issue, his velocity was fine in the fall. Duplantier sits 93-96 and makes heavy use of three good secondary pitches.

Those concerns weren't assuaged when he threw just one inning in his pro debut due to elbow soreness, but he took a huge step toward erasing doubts with a dominant and healthy first full season that saw him lead the Minors in ERA (1.39) while pitching across two levels and attending the Futures Game. He was shelved for an extended period in 2018 with right biceps tendinitis that limited him to just 67 innings in Double-A, but made up for lost time with an impressive performance in the Arizona Fall League.  Duplantier's fastball usually sits in the 93-95 mph range, but he can reach back for more when needed. He throws it with sink and run, making him effective both at getting ground-ball outs and missing bats. His slider is at least above average and represents his best secondary offering, thrown with power, at 85-87 mph, and late biting action that nets him whiffs and is especially lethal against righties. He also throws an effective curveball in the low 80s and has feel for a mid-80s changeup, though he'll need to refine the latter to neutralize left-handed hitters. He's around the strike zone with his entire four-pitch mix.  The strong and athletic Duplantier has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success, but concerns likely will persist on account of his arm action and low three-quarters slot. If he can stay healthy, Duplantier's combination of athleticism, stuff and command point to a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"MLB\"","3","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"51.4\"","\"55.7\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2600","50","60","45","50","55","","","55","60","55","50","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","55","","","","50","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["89","88","101","131","129","\"52.4\"","\"50.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"52.7\"","\"47.3\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Francisco\"","\"Mejia\"","2019","\"23.6\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","200","4","\"|\"","771","642336","","16403","\"sa739565\"","\"|\"","71","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"zjm3SlBQSVM\"","\"We love Mejia's bat but he still hasn't made much progress as a receiver, and if he has to move to an outfield corner, his hedonistic approach suddenly becomes scary.\"","\"Acquired from Cleveland for Brad Hand, Mejia is one of the more entertaining hitters to watch in the minors, but he has a few flaws that need to be corrected for him to reach his substantial ceiling, and possibly for him to profile at all. He has a very aggressive approach and a funky, high-effort swing from both sides of the plate, and they're only sustainable because Mejia has elite hand-eye coordination and bat control. His swing-happy approach could limit his on-base ability quite a bit, and possibly his power output, too, which would be less of a problem if Mejia could definitely stick as a catcher. Mejia has an elite arm but is a below-average receiver currently.   Before they traded him, Cleveland tried Mejia at third base and the outfield corners. San Diego seems inclined to just let him catch, but if Wil Myers' defensive movement is any indication, they're open to trying new things. There are probably certain types of pitchers that Mejia can catch without much issue, and it seems logical to pair him and Austin Hedges in a way that hides Mejia's issues while he can work on them and still gets reps. If he does have to move to, say, right field, the lack of plate discipline becomes an issue because the offensive bar out there is much higher.

This time, however, they shelled out big money to land Robinson, signing MLB Pipeline's No. 15 international prospect for more than $2.5 million. He already looks like a worthy investment after hitting his way up to the Pioneer League at age 17 in his professional debut.   Robinson generates massive raw power to all fields and showed in his first season that he could get to during games. That he already has a pretty good understanding of the strike zone and some plate discipline is impressive given his age and lack of experience. Those qualities, along with his explosive swing, give Robinson a chance to be at least an average hitter. He has the speed, range and instincts for center field, though, with so much physical projection remaining, there is a chance he'll outgrow the spot, in which he'll fit nicely at either outfield corner.   A case can be made that Robinson has the highest ceiling of any player in Arizona's system as a future slugger who could also stick in center field. The D-backs, however, are preaching patience and caution when talking about Robinson, noting that coming from the Bahamas isn't the same as coming from a place like the Dominican Republic in terms of experience. They see Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts as a potential model, one who played in the Dominican Summer League for his first summer of pro ball, while Robinson was able to jump straight the U.S for his pro debut in 2018.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"A-\"","4","\"2017 J2 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.5\"","\"55.9\"","\"52.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","30","55","60","40","60","50","60","70","55","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["93","92","84","130","79","\"52.3\"","\"51.0\"","\"50.0\"","\"53.4\"","\"50.4\"","\"53.6\"","\"|\"","\"Taylor\"","\"Widener\"","2019","\"24.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1989","642203","","","\"sa918271\"","\"|\"","123","\"South Carolina\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"hLU-GJ-aevE\"","\"Widener has a bevy of average or better pitches, and a delivery that looks like Max Scherzer's.

Acquired in that massive, three-team, Steven Souza deal, Widener is a curvaceous 6-foot righty with several above-average pitches and average command.

Moved into the rotation in 2017, he finished fourth in the system in strikeouts and sixth in ERA, then moved up to Double-A, where he finished off a playoff no-hitter. After being acquired by Arizona in a three-team trade in February that sent Brandon Drury to New York, Widener led the Double-A Southern League in strikeouts (176) and WHIP (1.03) and ranked second in ERA (2.75) in his second full season.  Widener confidently attacks hitters with a plus fastball that sits at 92-94 mph, bumps a few ticks higher and has a high-spin rate that helps him generate whiffs. He made progress in 2018 in developing an effective changeup, now his better secondary weapon, and he continues to work on the consistency and action of his mid-80s slider. He has an athletic delivery that he can repeat well, which should lead to solid control.  That Widener held up physically during his first two full seasons as a starter is encouraging considering he had ulnar transposition surgery on his pitching elbow in the fall of 2015 and also missed time with back and knee issues in college. Those prior injuries, combined with the fact that both his delivery and arm action require effort, have led some to forecast an eventual move to the bullpen, but the D-backs have been pleased with his development as a starter and will continue to develop him in that role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"AAA\"","5","\"2016 Draft Rnd 12 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"51.4\"","\"55.7\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2350","50","60","50","","50","50","","55","60","55","","55","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","","50","","","","50","\"SEA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["94","93","67","71","119","\"52.3\"","\"51.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"52.8\"","\"46.9\"","\"53.4\"","\"|\"","\"Nate\"","\"Pearson\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"245\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2033","663878","\"pearson_nate\"","","\"sa3005097\"","\"|\"","54","\"Central Florida JC (FL)\"","0","-1","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"t_D8-uewjYw\"","\"Pearson touched 104 and threw a 95 mph slider in the fall, but there's a good chance he ends up in relief.\"","\"We still know very little about Pearson compared to most 22-year-old pitching prospects. He popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser Florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when JuCo ball kicked off in January of 2017. As the draft approached, Pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping 100 mph in bullpen sessions for scouts. He forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him, and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury.   Pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the Northwest League during the summer and was poised to begin 2018 at Hi-A Dunedin (an aggressive assignment), but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the DL. In his final extended spring rehab start, he was sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with the fastball. He finally toed a Florida State League rubber that week and lasted 1.2 innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna. The injury ended his regular season after just five outs.   After rest and some rehab during instructs, Pearson went to Arizona for the Fall League. His stuff was electric there, his fastball always sitting 95-99 and cresting 100 mph often. He threw a 104 mph fastball and a 95 mph slider during the Fall Stars game, and he was able to dump his upper-70s curveball in for strikes throughout his six-week tenure, though he threw no changeups. Pearson was also horribly wild at times. It's fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of Pearson, it's impossible to know for sure.   There's a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen, but if he does and he breathes one-inning fire like he did during Fall Stars, he basically has Aroldis Chapman's stuff (though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle). Provided he stays healthy, Pearson's future is bright, albeit unclear. He's likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost 2018, but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff, there is still frontline starter potential.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2017, 1st (28) - TOR\"","","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 75 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  Pearson had some late helium ahead of the 2017 Draft after he hit 102 mph during a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May. The Blue Jays ended up selecting the JC of Central Florida product with the second of their two first-round picks the following month, signed him for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900 and then watched him light up radar guns during a dominant pro debut. Pearson's first full season lasted just 1 2/3 innings as he suffered a fractured right forearm after being struck by a line drive in early May, but he returned to the mound and impressed in the Arizona Fall League, finishing with a series of strong outings after a rusty start.  Pearson features front-of-the-rotation stuff when he's healthy, including the best fastball and slider in Toronto's system. His fastball sits in the upper 90s and routinely touches triple digits, and he showed he could run his heater up to 103-104 during an all-out first inning in the Fall Stars Game. His slider is a similarly powerful offering, thrown in the upper 80s with late, glove-side bite that leads to both whiffs and weak contact, especially against righties. He showed feel for landing a top-to-bottom curveball in the zone during the AFL, giving him a solid change-of-pace breaking ball, and his changeup should be at least average once developed.  Pearson uses his height to his advantage, creating a downhill angle to the plate so as to pound his fastball and slider down in the zone, and he's athletic enough to believe that both his control and command will improve as he gains experience. Few pitching prospects in the Minors can match Pearson's high ceiling, and he can move closer to reaching it with a healthy campaign in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"55.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","2.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2500","35","70","45","50","60","","","45","80","55","55","65","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","75","50","45","55","","","","45","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["95","94","63","72","80","\"52.3\"","\"51.7\"","\"51.4\"","\"53.4\"","\"47.5\"","\"53.9\"","\"|\"","\"Cole\"","\"Winn\"","2019","\"19.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2389","668390","\"winn_cole\"","","\"sa3008662\"","\"|\"","76","\"Orange Lutheran HS (CA)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","50","\"JTWvLDwruWs\"","\"The most advanced high school arm in the 2018 draft, Winn already flashes three plus pitches and has command of each.\"","\"Before his senior year in high school, Winn moved from Colorado to Orange Lutheran, a powerhouse program in southern California.

He also has an average slider and changeup, though there's a chance the change grows into a plus offering at some point. His command projects to be above average, as he already uses his smooth delivery to deliver pitches to fine locations rather than just over the plate. He was largely seen as the safest pick amongst the 2018 prep pitchers, a notoriously risky demographic. Texas has a deliberate approach to developing prep pitching with an onboarding process that includes a pro debut in instructional league, so Winn's actual regular season pro debut will come in 2019.

Winn already possesses two plus pitches in a 92-95 mph fastball that reaches 97 with some armside run and a curveball with true 12-to-6 break. He added a low-80s slider during his high school senior season, and it has already shown flashes of becoming a wipeout pitch. He gets good fading action on his changeup, which should improve as he uses it more against pro hitters.    Winn's athleticism allows him to repeat his clean delivery and maintain his quality stuff deep into games. He's extremely advanced and has better control and command than most pitchers his age.

His changeup is average, flashing above, and Lambert has long deployed it with veteran cunning, and he'll run it back onto the glove-side corner of the plate for looking strikes.

Lambert, the organization's second-round pick in 2015 out of the California high school ranks, has used his combination of solid stuff and advanced pitchability to thrive in several of those situations. He reached Triple-A at age 21 in 2018, the first place he's truly struggled.  Lambert has used a four-pitch mix to knock on the big league door. His bread-and-butter has been his fastball-changeup combination, a sinking heater in the low-90s that touches 96 mph on occasion and a plus offspeed pitch with tumble that keeps hitters off-balance. The biggest progress Lambert made in 2018 was the improvement of his curve. Once more of a loopy breaking ball, it has more sharpness and late break to it, turning into a true out pitch that should lead to more strikeouts in the future. He mirrors his fastball release point with the pitch and because he has such great fastball command, hitters have no idea what's coming. He'll also still mix in his slider, his fourth best pitch, but one that still is Major League-average.  Lambert learned in Triple-A that he couldn't survive if he didn't hit his spots down in the zone.

Swaggerty showed bat control and gap power, and was a fringe first rounder for many off that first, extended look on Team USA, but he came out this spring looking like a different player. He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength, lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power, arm strength and speed.   Swaggerty didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference who had also hit with wood on the Cape, and it was because his new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times, causing him to lose balance and be in a poor position to hit offspeed stuff.

Swaggerty jumped on the radar with a huge sophomore year and performed well for Team USA that summer, building anticipation for his junior year in 2018. That turned out to be a bit inconsistent for the outfielder, though he did hit 13 home runs. The Pirates liked the overall resume enough to take him No. 10 overall, and he reached full-season ball in his debut summer.    Swaggerty has the potential to have at least big league average tools across the board. The left-handed hitter has an incredibly patient approach, getting on base a ton, which should allow him to use his speed to his advantage frequently. There's a bit too much swing and miss at times, often offset by that walk rate, as he can get too aggressive at the plate. That was particularly true in 2018, when some felt he was trying to sell out for power too often. He does have the kind of raw pop that should allow him to naturally find the seats without taking him out of his gameplan at the plate.    The speed that makes Swaggerty a basestealing threat also allows him to cover a lot of ground in center field, where he has every chance to stay long-term.

He holds 94-97 for six innings, his upper-80s slider with vertical break is reminiscent of early-career Brad Lidge, and he has somehow found changeup feel and command despite few career in-game reps. But while Loaisiga has mid-rotation, big league stuff, his career has been beset by constant, often severe, injury. Since entering pro ball in 2013, Loaisiga has only thrown about 200 career innings due to repeated injury and rehab, and his 68 innings pitched for the DSL Giants during his first pro campaign remain his single-season high. He missed all of 2014 with injury, then was released, and out of pro baseball for all of 2015. The Yankees unearthed him during the 2016 23U World Championships in Venezuela and after a frantic late-night call from scout Ricardo Finol, signed Loaisiga immediately. Just two innings into his first 2016 start, Loaisiga's velocity dropped into the mid-80s and he left the mound pointing at his elbow. He rehabbed quickly enough that he was able to make 11 short starts with Staten Island the following year.   Because Loaisiga signed in 2012, he would have been Rule 5 eligible in the winter of 2017. The Yankees added him to the 40-man even though he had never completed a healthy start in full-season ball. In 2018, Loaisiga ascended quickly and showed flashes of brilliance against big league hitters, but he also made two more trips to the disabled list, including a late-season stint due to shoulder inflammation. Shoulder issues have sidelined Loaisiga pretty frequently during his career, and while he may have some years where he peaks in the 3-4 WAR range, we also think he'll have some years where he barely pitches, or that he may just move to the bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"Sept. 13, 2012 - SF\"","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  Originally signed by the Giants out of Nicaragua in 2012, Loaisiga had a decent pro debut the next summer before missing the next two years with shoulder issues and drawing his release in May 2015. The Yankees signed him in February 2016 after watching him reach 95 mph during a tryout, but he blew out his elbow after making one start in Class A and needed Tommy John surgery. He has been a revelation since returning, needing just 77 2/3 innings to rise from Rookie ball to the Majors, where he blanked the Rays for five innings in his debut last June 15.  Loaisiga lacks physicality but makes up for it with a quick arm that produces three pitches that each can grade at plus or better at their best. He sits around 95-96 mph with his four-seam fastball, pumping it up to 98 with some late life. His fading changeup was his most effective offering in his first taste of New York, though it gets a bit firm at times, and his high-spin breaking ball combines curveball depth with slider velocity in the mid-80s.  Loaisiga has a history of pounding the strike zone, averaging 1.6 walks per nine innings in his first four Minor League seasons, though his control got away from him in his introduction to big league hitters.

After the issue was resolved, Marsh took things slow for a while at the Angels complex in Tempe, limited to activities like BP while others played in actual games. The sound of the ball off his bat during those BP side sessions was very distracting. Marsh stayed in Arizona during the spring of 2017 and was much more physical than most of his AZL peers. Marsh had statistical success there and in the Midwest League the following spring, before finally scuffling at Hi-A.   Though he has above-average raw power, Marsh's in-game cut is more contact-oriented, geared for contact to the opposite field and back up the middle. During instructional league, Marsh was awkwardly swinging without a stride, likely not a swing change, but perhaps an exercise that forces him to clear his hips and improve his ability to pull the ball with power. There's a non-zero chance Marsh stays in center field but it's more likely that he moves to a corner.

He wasn't even able to start his pro career in earnest until 2017 because of a back injury. The Angels didn't want to get too excited about his debut in the Pioneer League that summer, but it was hard not to be encouraged by his 2018 that saw him play across both levels of A ball.    While Marsh had a very productive first taste of full-season ball, what makes him an even more intriguing prospect is that he still has a lot to learn, especially at the plate. He does have a good feel to hit and showed he's more than willing to draw walks, but there is a lot of swing and miss there and he does need to work on the consistency of his swing. Once he does that, he should be able to hit for average and power. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he showed the ability to steal a base and run down everything in center field.     Marsh showed he can be a plus defender at all three outfield positions, and his plus arm certainly would play in right. He and top prospect Jo Adell form a super-athletic outfield prospect duo that could be ready to join Mike Trout in about a year.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"54.1\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","55","60","40","60","55","50","60","55","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","60","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["100","99","77","127","32","\"52.1\"","\"51.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"55.1\"","\"50.9\"","\"55.5\"","\"|\"","\"Peter\"","\"Alonso\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","200","4","\"|\"","1732","624413","\"alonso_peter\"","19251","\"sa873981\"","\"|\"","48","\"Florida\"","-1","2","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"Yr1fm8IK4nw\"","\"Alonso has elite raw power and lead the minors in homers last year. He is not a good defensive first baseman and may be the primary beneficiary if the universal DH is instituted. \"","\"Alonso followed up a breakout 2017 with a minor league leading 36-home run 2018 campaign split between Double-A Binghamton and Triple-A launching pad Las Vegas. In addition to clubbing the most home runs, Alonso hit some of 2018's loudest individual blasts. He had the most prolific batting practice session at the Futures Game, then threatened a passing satellite with a titanic seventh-inning homer off of a grooved, 95mph Adonis Medina fastball. He exceeded Mets Statcast-era records on a ball in play in the Arizona Fall League, out-hit Vlad Guerrero, Jr. during Fall Stars BP, then homered the opposite way off a 103mph Nate Pearson fastball in the game. This is what top-of-the-scale, strength-driven raw power looks like, and it drives an excellent version of a profile we're typically quite bearish on: the heavy-bodied, right/right first baseman. Alonso is tough to beat with velocity because his swing is compact and even when he's a little late, he's capable of muscling mis-hit balls out the other way. After some adjustment, Fall League pitching chose to attack him beneath the knees, and well-located pitches down there were successful, but Alonso crushes mistake breaking balls that catch too much of the zone. We think a typical Alonso season will look like something between what C.J. Cron and Jesus Aguilar did last year, depending on whether the 2018 uptick in Alonso's walk rate holds water or not. He makes some nice effort-based plays at first base, but as a feet and hands athlete, Alonso is well below average. Perhaps more notable than what we anticipate will be several years of mashing in the heart of the Mets lineup, Alonso is a favorite to become the poster child for player compensation reform. Already near the center of public discourse regarding teams' suppression of prospect promotion, Alonso is 24 years old and has a skillset and body type at heightened risk to enter physical decline relatively early. With his early-career earning power stifled by his parent club, Alonso might start to show signs of physical regression during his arbitration years and also struggle to find a lucrative market in free agency. His free agency is timed awkwardly between what will probably be the next two CBA negotiations, but otherwise the circumstances indicate his situation could one day be a focal point for change.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"MLB\"","1","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"50.9\"","\"55.5\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","55","80","30","40","50","50","70","80","30","40","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TEX\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["101","100","120","125","224","\"52.0\"","\"50.1\"","\"50.0\"","\"51.4\"","\"44.8\"","\"52.0\"","\"|\"","\"Daz\"","\"Cameron\"","2019","\"22.4\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1237","663662","\"cameron_daz\"","","\"sa874736\"","\"|\"","103","\"Eagle's Landing Christian HS (GA)\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","50","\"BmUTuuIHb4w\"","\"Daz is the son of Mike Cameron, and has been on the scouting radar for a half dozen years.

Daz was an elite talent early on in his own right, but the rest of his draft class slowly caught up and by his draft year, he was one of the top dozen or so prep bats, rather than the clear top talent. The questions then are still largely the questions now: he's a plus runner who can play a solid center field with average raw power, but scouts question how much offensive impact there will be. Cameron has already surpassed the expectations that pessimistic scouts had for him as an amateur, but even scouts that like him now say he's a potential low-end regular, possibly in the Keon Broxton mold, or even a poor man's version of his father.

Viewed as someone who might need extra time to develop in the Minors, Cameron was overmatched in his first taste of full-season ball in 2016, and he also struggled at the outset of 2017 before things started to click. He was finishing off a fantastic second half in the Midwest League when the Astros packaged him with Franklin Perez and Jake Rogers to the Tigers for Justin Verlander. He began to put it all together in 2018, ascending from high Class A to Triple-A at age 21 before a standout turn in the Arizona Fall League.  The son of former big league center fielder Mike Cameron, Daz has the chance to be an impactful up-the-middle big leaguer as well. Mechanical changes that put him in a better position to hit made a huge difference and contributed directly to his turnaround at the plate. Perhaps more importantly, Cameron has developed a real approach at the plate, showing selective aggressiveness with a hit-to-all fields mentality early in the count. He's started to tap into some power, too, and some scouts believe he'll be a 15-20-homer guy in the big leagues.   A plus runner and overall graceful athlete, Cameron can steal a base but will have to learn to be more efficient in the future. That speed to go along with plus defensive instincts will allow him to stay in center for the long haul, and he has the arm strength needed for an outfield corner. Cameron's ceiling is still coming into focus, but all the pieces are there for him to develop into an everyday center fielder at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"AAA\"","4","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"52.3\"","\"51.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","50","50","50","50","55","45","50","55","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","60","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["102","101","82","69","217","\"51.9\"","\"51.0\"","\"51.4\"","\"51.5\"","\"44.2\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","\"Oneil\"","\"Cruz\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2004","665833","","","\"sa917318\"","\"|\"","53","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2021","50","\"GzwLKufiG4A\"","\"Prospectdom's version of Giannis Antetokounmpo, there are any number of possible outcomes for Cruz, most of them involve him hitting for huge power.\"","\"A peerless physical freak, Cruz is a 6-foot-7 shortstop with elite raw arm strength and raw power projection. He body-comps more closely to someone like Harold Carmichael or Brandon Ingram than he does anyone in his own sport, and there are several vastly different ideas as to how his body and game will develop as he fills out. Despite his ectomorphic build, lever length, and physical immaturtiy, Cruz has performed and has handled aggressive assignments pretty well. The Dodgers sent him to Low-A Great Lakes when he was 18, where he ran into 20 extra-base hits in 90 games before being traded to Pittsburgh at the deadline for Tony Watson. He hit .286/.343/.488 in 2018 while repeating Low-A.   There's real risk Cruz maxes out as a 40 bat, but as long as he's getting to most of that power, he'll likely profile just about anywhere on the defensive spectrum. So, where exactly on the defensive spectrum will that be? Shortstops this big don't exist, but there's some sentiment in the industry that Cruz will be able to stay there, especially as we enter the era of the lead-footed shortstop. Others consider Cruz's speed viable in center field long term. Those who think he'll thicken significantly have him projected to either right field or third base, and others think his size would make for a wonderful target at first. One source thinks Cruz should just be pitching, due to his arm strength and athleticism. Clearly this is one of the more bizarre prospects in baseball with countless possible career outcomes. Most of them are very positive or highly entertaining; several of them end in stardom.\"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - LAD\"","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 55 | Arm: 70 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55    Every once in a while a prospect comes along to defies traditional evaluations, who can't really fit into a specific box. Cruz, signed by the Dodgers in 2015 and traded to the Pirates in the Tony Watson deal in July 2017, could very well be that kind of player, especially following his strong first full season with his new organization in 2018.    Tall and gangly, Cruz has grown since first entering pro ball and now stands at 6-foot-6, not a height anyone has seen stick at shortstop. And while there's still a good chance he doesn't, he's made more strides at the premium position than anyone anticipated, with a cannon for an arm and above-average speed that helps him range-wise. Super-athletic, Cruz could easily handle an outfield spot should he slow down as he physically matures, and he could easily be an above-average defender in a corner. His real upside, though, comes with the bat. He has as much raw power as anyone in the system and, thanks to some excellent adjustments, he started tapping into it more consistently as a teenager in the South Atlantic League, hitting 14 home runs.    There's still more refinement in terms of strike zone discipline Cruz can make, but he's shown he is more than capable of developing that part of his game. Just 20 for all of the 2019 season, Cruz has tremendous upside and should continue to be one of the most fascinating prospects to track.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PIT\"","\"A+\"","4","\"2015 J2 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"52.3\"","\"51.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","70","60","40","80","40","60","80","45","45","80","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","55","70","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["103","102","137","124","427","\"51.8\"","\"49.8\"","\"50.0\"","\"49.8\"","\"47.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Garrett\"","\"Hampson\"","2019","\"24.6\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","200","4","\"|\"","1766","641658","\"hampson_garrett\"","19262","\"sa738479\"","\"|\"","112","\"Long Beach State\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"dAUevwXdsms\"","\"Another high-contact bat who can play a few up-the-middle positions, Hampson had a strong 24-game audition in Colorado last year.\"","\"Hampson was a star at Long Beach State and a mainstay on the Team USA collegiate national team. Scouts doubted he'd stay at shortstop and were worried he wouldn't have enough power to play second base, which is largely why Hampson fell to the third round of his draft despite three years of strong performance.   He's hit for more power in pro ball than he ever did in college, probably because Long Beach's marine layer makes it more difficult to hit for power there, and also because the Rockies affiliates are all launching pads. It's hard to conclude that Hampson's minor league power output (.457 SLG, mostly via doubles and triples) won't continue because his future home is going to be Coors Field. He has also stolen way more bases as a pro than he did in college, peaking with 51 steals in 2017, and 38 last year. Rockies prospects are encouraged to run, but Hampson is indeed a 70 runner and will add value on big league basepaths. Though it's unclear what the Rockies will do about the Daniel Murphy-Ian Desmond-Ryan McMahon logjam that spills over into second base, not to mention Brendan Rodgers' recent call-up, Hampson seems like a good bet to be a solid everyday player for someone.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","\"AAA\"","2","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (COL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"47.3\"","\"50.0\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","40","40","70","45","50","55","40","40","70","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["104","103","90","68","254","\"51.8\"","\"50.8\"","\"51.4\"","\"51.1\"","\"43.9\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Jonathan\"","\"India\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1310","663697","\"india_jonathan\"","","\"sa3008178\"","\"|\"","60","\"Florida\"","0","1","","\"Low\"","2020","50","\"KPK-GaBvm6U\"","\"The 2018 draft's biggest riser, India is a terrific all-around player who should be an average regular very soon.\"","\"India was a well-known prep prospect in South Florida, but the combination of a solid, but not spectacular, tool set and seven-figure asking price sent him to Florida. His first two years were about as expected; India got regular ABs but didn't have any performative breakthroughs. In his draft year, India lost bad weight and added some strength, made some offensive adjustments, and exploded, torching the best conference in the country to the tune of a 1.21 OPS and 21 homers in 68 games. Scouts saw early in the spring that his tools had improved and the performance along with them, but it wasn't until mid-way through the season that he seemed like a sure first round pick. He eventually looked like a consensus top 10 pick in the weeks leading up to the draft because the first round had so few college bats. India has 55 raw power (60 for some scouts) and is a 55 defender with a 55 arm at third base. He played some shortstop at Florida and could be a limited-range fill-in there, with a chance to fit at second base if needed for longer stretches.

The Reds selected him at No. 5 overall and signed him for $5,297,500, nearly $600,000 below pick value.    Although he appeared to be exhausted following a college season, the College World Series and the Draft process, India still navigated his way through his first pro summer and appeared with three different affiliates. All the while, he still demonstrated why he was a top 5 Draft pick. With an advanced approach at the plate, he has excellent plate discipline and the ability to hit for average that should translate. India also has flashes of above-average power. Despite not being too speedy, he can be deceptively quick and is a solid baserunner with great instincts. A third baseman in college, India played there and at shortstop and could also likely man second base. He has a strong above-average arm with fielding skills and athleticism that would likely enable him to play multiple positions well.

There's a story going around scouting circles that Solak actually broke one club's makeup algorithm, scoring higher than they thought was possible. It's probably not surprising to hear that he's a grinder type of player who makes the most of his sneaky-good tools. Solak has a pretty level cut, but is an opportunistic enough hitter to know how to lift mistake pitches and use his deceptively-average raw power. He's a plus runner who projects to play an average second base and be an everyday player, but he can play almost any other position on the field if needed, with an arm that's just a bit shy of what's preferred for shortstop. He put up a 19 home run, 21 stolen base season in Triple-A last year and would be penciled in as a top prospect about to be handed an everyday job for almost any other club, but the Rays are insanely well stocked with middle infielders, including arguably the best in the minor leagues in Wander Franco; Vidal Brujan is also ahead of Solak on this list. The Rays like to have a versatile big league roster, but there's likely a trade coming at some point to clear out spots, with Willy Adames, Joey Wendle, Brandon Lowe, Matt Duffy, Yandy Diaz, Daniel Robertson, and Christian Arroyo all seemingly ahead of Solak in the running for three starting spots since first base and designated hitter are also fully manned.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2016, 2nd (62) - NYY\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 55 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    Solak has been among the leaders in multiple offensive categories at every stage of his career. A second-round pick by the Yankees in 2016, the Louisville product finished third in the Short-Season New York-Penn League in batting (.321) and on-base percentage (.412) in his pro debut, then finished second (.301) and first (.397) in those categories in the Class A Advanced Florida State League the following year, despite bypassing the Class A level entirely. During the offseason, the Rays acquired him as part of a three-team trade with the D-backs. It was more of the same for Solak in his first year in the Rays' system, as he led the Double-A Southern League in hits (135), runs (91) and OBP (.384), and nearly achieved a 20-20 campaign before finishing with 19 homers and steals.   One of the better pure hitters in Tampa Bay's system, Solak makes repeated line-drive contact with a quick right-handed swing and a hit-to-all-fields approach. He manages the strike zone well and consistently puts together good at-bats, employing a selectively aggressive approach that fuels his ability to hit for average and also get on base at a high clip. Though not a power hitter, Solak does have some juice in his bat and showed in 2018 that can jump the yard to all fields en route to a career-high home run total. Solak's speed makes him a threat to steal on the basepaths, and the Rays like how he wisely picks his spots to run.  Solak has a below-average arm and isn't the most fluid second baseman, but he has worked hard to improve his footwork at the keystone and makes all the routine plays. The Rays started to increase his versatility last year with reps in the outfield, and Solak held his own in both left field and center to go along with his usual work on the dirt.

After a solid pro debut, he was one of four players shipped to the Padres as part of the Craig Kimbrel trade that November. Elbow soreness limited Allen's time on the mound the following year, but he had a healthy campaign in 2017 and then put it all together last season at age 21, earning an August promotion from Double-A to Triple-A, where he won four of his five starts. The Texas League Pitcher of the Year finished with a 2.54 ERA between the two levels and led the system with 14 wins and 151 strikeouts.      After pitching with a below-average fastball at the outset of his career, Allen now operates more in the 92-94 mph range with late life. He's aggressive with his fastball placement, too, and confidently attacks right-handed hitters on the inner half of the plate. A changeup that receives plus grades and plays nicely off his heater is Allen's best secondary offering, and he also has feel for throwing his curveball and slider for a strike, with the latter grading as the better pitch.    Allen did his part to assuage any concerns about a potential injury in 2017 by logging 125 innings and then handled a career-high workload last season in the upper Minors, working 148 2/3 frames. Allen's four-pitch mix along with his pitchabiliy give him a higher floor than ceiling, and he has the durability needed to be a workhorse starter in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"AAA\"","9","\"2015 Draft Rnd 8 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"51.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2200","40","50","55","50","","","","50","50","60","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","60","45","50","","","","50","\"MIA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["108","107","96","67","337","\"51.6\"","\"50.6\"","\"51.4\"","\"50.4\"","\"43.5\"","\"51.0\"","\"|\"","\"Nico\"","\"Hoerner\"","2019","\"22.1\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2429","663538","\"hoerner_nico\"","","\"sa3007867\"","\"|\"","61","\"Stanford\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","50","\"W6oDgCR-O3c\"","\"Hoener made some subtle swing changes after the draft that got him hitting for more power.

He hit for much more power than was anticipated in the summer and fall, and the identifiable mechanical tweak is evidence that the change is real and not small-sample noise. Hoerner makes routine plays at short and so long as scouts are okay with his funkny throwing motion, he has a chance to stay there. There are scouts who have him projected to second base or to center field. Hoerner's previous swing enabled a bit of a jailbreak out of the batter's box, exaggerating his home-to-first speed.

Since signing for $2,724,000 as the 24th overall pick in June, Hoerner has lived up to his reputation as one of the best hitters in the 2018 Draft class. He has handled every challenge Chicago has given him, including an Arizona Fall League assignment last offseason and a promotion to Double-A to start his first full season, slowed only by strained left elbow ligaments last summer and a hairline fracture of his left wrist after getting hit by a pitch this April.  Hoerner excels at putting the bat on the ball, thanks to his uncanny hand-eye coordination, compact right-handed swing and controlled approach. Though he hit just three homers in three years at Stanford, he has strong hands and has driven the ball in his short history with wood bats. He has the sneaky power to hit 15 homers per season, not to mention the patience to draw walks and the solid to plus speed to steal bases.  Though he has the quickness and athleticism for shortstop, scouts are mixed on his ability to stay there. His instincts and reliability stand out more than his range or arm at shortstop, so he may be better suited for second base and has drawn comparisons to Ian Kinsler.

Some of this success was probably because Casas was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left Casas games having seen him swing just once or twice because he was constantly walking. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing (mostly during instructs though, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer) but expectations are he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package. The margin for error for a teenage first base-only types is very small, but we're also very high on Casas' bat.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","\"2018, 1st (26) - BOS\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 30 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Though the Red Sox picked 26th in the 2018 Draft, they still came away with one of the best power hitters available in Casas, who signed for $2,552,800. He led the U.S. 18-and-under national team in homers and RBIs in both 2016 (as its youngest player) and 2017, winning 18U World Cup MVP honors and the World Baseball Softball Confederation player of the year award in the latter year. Originally set to graduate from high school in 2019 before reclassifying for the 2018 Draft, he played just two games in his pro debut before tearing a right thumb ligament while diving for a ball at third base.  While Casas has as much raw power as anyone in the 2018 Draft class, he's more than just a masher. His 6-foot-4 frame comes with a naturally long swing, but he has no difficulty making repeated contact because his feel for hitting and his plate discipline are very advanced for a teenager. And that contact is loud contact, the product of bat speed, strength and leverage from the left side of the plate.  For his size, Casas moves well and is relatively athletic, though he projects as a well below-average runner. The Red Sox are committed to trying him at third base and he has a strong arm that clocked low-90s fastballs when he pitched as an amateur, though most scouts think his size and lack of quickness will land him across the diamond. He improved his conditioning as a high school senior and has soft hands, enhancing his chances of becoming a solid defender at first base.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"A\"","1","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.0\"","\"57.3\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","25","35","70","40","45","60","50","65","80","30","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","30","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["110","109","145","119","425","\"51.5\"","\"49.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"49.8\"","\"43.5\"","\"50.3\"","\"|\"","\"Daulton\"","\"Varsho\"","2019","\"22.9\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1992","662139","\"varsho_daulton\"","","\"sa3002838\"","\"|\"","77","\"Wisconsin-Milwaukee\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2021","50","\"ePZeHPlIfmk\"","\"Varsho is still not a great receiver but his arm plays because he gets out of his crouch so quickly, and he has rare contact ability and speed for a catcher.\"","\"The list of catchers with speed comparable to Varsho's is pretty short.

He's also a doubles machine with natural feel for gap-to-gap contact, and if soft liners trickle between outfielders, Varsho can turn those into hustle doubles.   He remains a below-average receiver and often has trouble firmly squeezing balls in his glove, at times struggling to block breaking stuff in the dirt. Because Varsho is an above-average athlete, most scouts think these aspects of catching will become viable in time and that Varsho may just be behind in this regard due to his cold weather, small school background.

He led the short-season Northwest League in OPS (.902) in his pro debut and was having a solid first full season in the California League before requiring surgery in June to repair a broken right hamate bone. He returned to Visalia in August, hit well down the stretch and then made up for some lost time with a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League.   There is a lot to like in Varsho's innate ability to impact the baseball. He has a short, strong stroke from the left side and knows the strike zone well, with a natural ability to backspin the ball that leads to plenty of power. He has an aggressive approach but also shows a discerning eye, often fouling off tough pitches to prolong at-bats. Unlike most catchers, Varsho has at least above-average wheels and a desire to contribute on the basepaths, and he was successful in 19 of 22 steal attempts in 2018. Behind the plate, Varsho's athleticism makes him an adept blocker, and he doesn't shy away from trying to back-pick baserunners. He improved his catch-and-throw skills and threw out nearly 40 percent of basestealers at Visalia, but he still has gains to make on that front, as well as with his receiving.  Varsho is athletic enough for the outfield if he can't stick behind the plate, and some believe he could even handle second base. Regardless of his future defensive home, Varsho has a bright future in the big leagues with his bat, athleticism and baseball IQ.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.5\"","\"49.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","50","55","40","45","55","45","50","55","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["111","110","99","64","442","\"51.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"49.7\"","\"46.0\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Monte\"","\"Harrison\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","747","656509","\"harrison_monte\"","","\"sa828691\"","\"|\"","110","\"Lee's Summit West HS (MO)\"","2","-1","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"BW5Y0A3EeuI\"","\"Harrison's feel to hit remains slow to develop and he started tinkering with new swings during Fall League, which helped him put the ball in play but not with power.\"","\"If ever there were an athletic contest in which players from across multiple leagues had to compete against one another in all of their respective sports, Harrison would be a top five pick. An athletic deity in high school, Harrison was a star in every sport. He was an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaSwX9pJsI0' target='_blank'>acrobatic dunker</a> and a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8qRgoGQX2M' target='_blank'>dominant open-field runner</a>, who was signed away from a football commitment to Nebraska for $1.8 million. For much of his pro career, Harrison has either been hurt or underperformed. Aside from his .270/.350/.480 season in 2017, he has struggled to make contact, especially in 2018, when he struck out in 37% of his plate appearances, and a minor league leading 215 times. Despite this, Harrison nearly posted yet another 20/20 season and improved so much as a defensive player that he's now considered plus in center. The Marlins sent him to the Arizona Fall League with a desire to see some kind of bat-to-ball improvement. Harrison responded by ditching his leg kick. His strikeout rate in Arizona was 25% -- better than the summer, but still not great -- and he hit for almost no power there. His issues with strikeouts weren't, in our opinion, caused by excessive movement in his swing but rather by things like breaking ball recognition, bat path, and hand-eye coordination. Those aren't things that can be remedied by mechanical changes, and we'd rather an athlete like this be moving a lot at the plate to help ensure he's getting to as much of that power as possible, even if it means living with a lot of strikeouts. There's a wide range of outcomes possible for a talent like this, ranging from Carlos Gomez to Colby Rasmus to B.J. Upton to Drew Stubbs to Jake Marisnick. Harrison is a premium athlete with good makeup who should get plenty of opportunity to cure his own ills at the big league level. We think he's likely to be frustrating, but reasonably valuable, and possibly have some star-level seasons in his late twenties.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2014, 2nd (50) - MIL\"","","2020","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 70 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  A three-sport standout in high school, Harrison opted to play baseball over accepting a football scholarship from the University of Nebraska. The Brewers made him their second-round pick in 2014, swaying him with a well-over-slot $1.8 mllion bonus. After ankle and hamate injuries sidetracked his first two full pro seasons, Harrison broke out with 21 homers and 27 steals in 2017, then got traded to the Marlins along with Lewis Brinson, second baseman Isan Diaz and right-hander Jordan Yamamoto for Christian Yelich during the offseason.   In terms of pure athleticism and brute strength, Harrison has tremendous upside. A career .242 hitter who led the Minors with 215 strikeouts in 2018, he must demonstrate he can make consistent contact to reach his true potential. Even when he struggled in his first season in the Miami system, his upside was evident with 19 homers and 28 steals. According to Marlins metrics, 20 percent of the balls he put in play in Double-A had exit speeds of more than 105 mph, nearly three times the MLB average of 7 percent. Defensively, he has the quickness for center field and a cannon for an arm that easily would fit in right.  Harrison made some adjustments in the Arizona Fall League, reducing his front leg kick and producing more regular contact. If he stays healthy and keeps refining his swing, he could develop into a 30-30 player.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"AAA\"","4","\"2014 Draft Rnd 2 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.5\"","\"50.9\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","45","65","60","50","70","35","55","65","60","60","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","55","60","70","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["112","111","100","65","426","\"51.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"49.8\"","\"45.4\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Isaac\"","\"Paredes\"","2019","\"20.3\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2257","670623","","","\"sa920275\"","\"|\"","107","\"Mexico\"","-1","2","","\"Med\"","2021","50","\"f5iDesF-nuc\"","\"Paredes had a wonderful 2018 but his ultimate defensive home has come into question, as has his body's projectability.\"","\"It's hard to quibble with Paredes' stellar 2018. He hit .278/.359/.456 across two levels, and reached and performed at Double-A Erie as a 19-year-old. He's been drawing trade interest since the moment he set foot on the Cubs complex in 2016 due to his very mature feel to hit, which belies his age. Despite this, there are concerns about Paredes. He already has a catcherly build as a teenager and though he has spent the bulk of his pro innings at shortstop, he's not going to stay there and probably won't end up on the middle infield at all. He may eventually have to try to catch (which would slow his development, or the grind may dilute his offensive production) or move to first base, where he saw some reps in the Mexican League this offseason. The instability on defense is concerning even though everyone loves Paredes' bat.

Paredes' advanced bat was on full display during his first season with the Tigers, as he garnered All-Star honors in the Florida State League before a July promotion up to Double-A. He more than held his own in the Eastern League at age 19, slashing .321/.406/.458 over 39 games, then tied a bow on his season with a strong showing in the Mexican Winter League.   Paredes' success and overall consistency at the plate reflects just how well he can swing the bat. He has preternatural feel for putting the barrel on the ball and covers the plate well, with an advanced, contact-focused approach that results in low strikeout totals. He projects to have average Major League power, and he hit a career-best 15 homers in 2018, albeit exclusively to his pull-side. Physically mature for his age with a thicker build, Paredes is a fringey runner who could lose a step.   Paredes is a reliable defender at shortstop, with good hands and a strong, above-average arm, but also modest range that might require him to move to another position. Second and third base are options, and he saw meaningful time at both in 2018, logging 45 games between the two positions on top of his primary work at shortstop (74 games).

He's a career 12% strikeout hitter, whose rates haven't really moved even as the Dodgers have altered his swing to make it more explosive and try to get Verdugo to hit for more power. His stance is super wide open, the way Justin Turner's is, before Verdugo takes a long, slow stride toward the pitcher, leading with his heel, and then uncorks a max-effort hack that sometimes sends him reeling into the ground.   It's incredible that Verdugo is athletic enough to make so much contact with this swing, but he still doesn't lift the ball very much, and probably maxes out with doubles power.

He still would have landed a well over-slot bonus from Tampa Bay if he hadn't failed a post-Draft physical, and more medical questions arose when he missed two months as a sophomore with an elbow injury that didn't require surgery. He has stayed healthy and done a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, putting himself in position to be one of the first pitchers drafted.  As a southpaw with a strong frame and four pitches, Thompson has the ingredients to become a mid-rotation starter. Both his fastball, which sits in the low 90s and tops out at 96 mph with some run and angle, and his low-80s slider are plus pitches at their best. He generates good spin rates on both his slider and curveball, which has more depth than power, and also mixes in a decent changeup.  Though some clubs still have concerns about Thompson's health history, he has helped his cause by not missing a start and working deeper into games this spring. His high-three-quarters delivery is relatively clean, and he's finally pounding the strike zone after battling it in his first two college seasons. He has a good chance to surpass Alex Meyer (No. 23 overall, 2011) for the distinction of being the highest-drafted pitcher ever from the Wildcats program.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","","4","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (STL)\"","\"|\"","18","19","\"STL\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"52.9\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","0.7500","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","50","45","55","45","","","50","55","55","60","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","55","","","","50","","",""],["115","114","162","283","40","\"51.4\"","\"48.9\"","\"46.4\"","\"54.7\"","\"48.4\"","\"55.3\"","\"|\"","\"George\"","\"Kirby\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"210\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2824","","\"kirby_george\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Elon\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2022","45","","\"Kirby has been trending up in the fall/winter, sitting in the mid-90's with a curveball that flashes plus at times; some scouts think he'll work his way into the first round and fellow small-school North Carolina righty Seth Johnson at Campbell isn't far behind.\"","\"Kirby had a very loud performance this spring, twirling 107 strikeouts to six walks in 88 innings for Elon.

That distinction belongs to Kirby, who capped a breakout sophomore year by posting a 24/1 K/BB ratio in 13 innings as a Cape Cod League reliever. He has followed up by winning Colonial Athletic Association pitcher of the year honors and leading D-I in strikeout/walk ratio (17.8) and walk rate (0.6 per nine innings) entering the NCAA tournament.  Kirby has four potential quality pitches to make it as a starter, beginning with a running fastball that sits in the low 90s, reaches 98 mph and should add more velocity as he gets stronger. He has feel for spinning the ball and both his curveball and slider show flashes of becoming plus offerings. He also has some aptitude for throwing a changeup with some sink.  Kirby has so much success with his fastball that he hasn't relied as much on his secondary pitches, which still need more consistency. He doesn't have any problems throwing strikes but will have to refine his command. He has a sound delivery and arm action, so it's easy to project him as a possible No. 3 starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","","9","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","19","20","\"SEA\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"56.4\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","0.7500","","","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","55","45","50","45","","","60","60","50","55","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","55","","","","60","","",""],["116","115","105","63","465","\"51.4\"","\"50.4\"","\"51.4\"","\"49.6\"","\"43.3\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Estevan\"","\"Florial\"","2019","\"21.5\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2223","664314","","","\"sa874464\"","\"|\"","99","\"Haiti\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"mYK2ssfvC80\"","\"We acknowledge Florial's tools belong way higher on this list, perhaps as high as Luis Robert's, but we don't think his contact issues will be easily solved. He's boom or bust.\"","\"Even those casually exposed to public facing prospect analysis become familiar with a few key concepts and player archetypes, and an early lesson often addresses the volatility of players like Florial, who have several elite tools that will lead to star-level performance if they hit enough, but who also carry significant risk that they will strike out too much to matter at all. Of course, the reason each individual player has strikeout issues can vary. Some hitters have feckless, over-aggressive approaches, while others can't recognize breaking balls or have a problem with lever length and get tied up inside. Florial's issues -- his strikeout rate has fallen between 27% and 32% each of the last three years -- appear to stem from his bat path and limited bat control. Stiff wrists cause his bat head to drag into the zone, which can cause him to be tardy on fastballs at the letters and, more frequently, flail at soft stuff dipping down and away from him. Yoan Moncada has similar issues that have yet to be remedied.   Florial does enough other stuff that, even if the strike outs remain an issue, he could still be a valuable big leaguer. He crushes anything down and in, has sufficient plate coverage to hit fastballs middle away, and has enough power to do damage to the opposite field. He also has good ball/strike recognition so, again like Moncada, there should be power, walks, and up-the-middle defense. We think Florial is likely to be an exciting but flawed everyday player, though it's not audacious to think his relative youth (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2018) and inexperience (he also missed a year of reps due to a suspension for bad paperwork) leave more room for growth than we anticipate.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"March 19, 2015 - NYY\"","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 65 | Arm: 65 | Field: 60 | Overall: 55  Assuming the identity of Haniel de Oleo when registering for school in the Dominican Republic, Florial emerged as one of the top prospects on the 2014 international signing market, but MLB banned him from signing for one year after discovering the discrepancy. After he produced a Haitian birth certificate with a slightly different birthdate, the Yankees signed him in March 2015 for $200,000, a fraction of what he would have earned without the controversy. He quickly established that he had the best all-around tools in the system, though his development was slowed by right hamate surgery that cost him two months last summer and will be again after he broke his right wrist when he crashed into the center-field wall during Spring Training.  Florial excites scouts with three tools that grade as well above average: his raw power, speed and arm strength. With the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing, he's well equipped to take advantage of Yankee Stadium. He's still raw and overly aggressive as a hitter, leading to concerns about whether he can make enough contact to realize his full potential, though he did post the best walk rate (13 percent) and second-best strikeout rate (25 percent) of his career during his truncated 2018 season.  Florial also has a lot to learn about basestealing, though if he puts everything together he could become a 30-30 player. He's improving as a defender in center field and should be an asset there in the big leagues. His cannon arm will fit anywhere he's needed.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A+\"","2","\"2014 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"50.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","60","45","80","40","55","60","60","50","80","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","65","65","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["117","116","148","117","657","\"51.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.5\"","\"45.1\"","\"48.8\"","\"|\"","\"Will\"","\"Smith\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1651","669257","\"smith_will\"","19197","\"sa873265\"","\"|\"","70","\"Louisville\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"PAOgaHuSvPg\"","\"A multi-positional prospect who can catch, Smith made a swing change in 2017 and unlocked dormant power, only to have a hole in his swing exposed last year.\"","\"In the 2016 draft, Smith was a scout's favorite on a loaded Louisville club that had eventual top-10 overall picks Corey Ray and Brendan McKay as the headliners.

He redshirted, then only threw 36 innings the following spring as a redshirt freshman and began his draft year in the bullpen, a relative unknown. He moved to the rotation in March and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent. In 2018, his first full season as a member of the rotation, Howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off. After two dominant months to close his regular season, Howard threw a no hitter in the Sally League playoffs. During that stretch, he was sitting 94-98 for much of his starts and flashing three good secondary pitches, the best of which is a disappearing, low-80s changeup. Howard can also freeze hitters with a mid-70s curveball and use it to get ahead, and his mid-80s slider has enough length to miss bats away from righties. Though he has below average fastball command, Howard's ability to throw his breaking balls for strikes significantly improves his chances of starting. His inning count in 2018 (112) was about the same as it was if you combine his college and pro workload from 2017, and it's fair to assume that even if Philly wants to him to throw more innings, an innings cap might impede a 2019 debut, even if Howard's stuff is ready. He has considerable upside if he can retain his stuff while carrying a 160-plus inning burden.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","\"2017, 2nd (45) - PHI\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  A reliever in his first year at Cal Poly, Howard moved into the rotation as a redshirt sophomore and took off, landing in the second round of the 2017 Draft and signing for below pick value. He rode a bit of a roller coaster in his first full season, but finished as strongly as perhaps any pitching prospect in baseball, including a one-walk, complete-game no-hitter in the South Atlantic League playoffs.  Howard's stuff and command took a big step forward in the latter stages of 2018, though there is still work to be done in terms of his overall command. Late in the season, he was up to 98 mph with his fastball consistently, sitting very comfortably in the 94-95 mph range, throwing his heater with plus life in the zone. His two breaking balls can be inconsistent and blend into each other at times, but he will show an above-average slider and a distinct curveball, with them occasionally looking like a cutter. His changeup has the chance to be at least average.  He misses plenty of bats and has the stuff to be a frontline starter. The only thing that could hold him back is his command and control. If he can build off of his improvements in finding the strike zone as well as consistent mechanics on his breaking stuff, he could reach that ceiling in the near future.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","\"A+\"","2","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.9\"","\"52.1\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2100","40","60","55","50","50","","","45","60","60","55","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","50","50","55","","","","45","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["120","118","191","377","10","\"51.2\"","\"48.1\"","\"45.0\"","\"57.5\"","\"48.3\"","\"58.3\"","\"|\"","\"Yerry\"","\"Rodriguez\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","180","4","\"|\"","3186","","","","\"sa918130\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"8-2tF4ZEJGw\"","","\"Rodriguez has a swing-and-miss heater that plays in the strike zone because of its spin and weird plane, plane caused by Rodriguez's lowish arm slot.

The changeup is Rodriguez's best secondary, and projects to plus, as does Rodriguez's command, which is already advanced. The fastball/changeup/command concoction was poisonous to rookie-level hitters in 2018; Rodriguez struck out 82 and walked just eight in 63 innings of AZL and Northwest League ball.

Ramos' 2018 struggles weren't entirely unexpected because at age 18 he was the youngest regular in the South Atlantic League, and he did make improvements over the course of the season. His bat speed and strength remain impressive, giving him the raw power to crush home runs to all fields. He needs to develop a more patient approach in order to make enough contact to do damage against advanced pitching, though his strikeout rate actually decreased from 2017 (32 percent) to 2018 (25 percent).  While Ramos displayed plus speed in pre-Draft workout, he plays as more of a solid runner and could slow a bit more as his muscular frame continues to mature. He spent all of his first two pro seasons in center field and is presently an average defender there, thanks more to his quickness than his instincts.

His $125,000 bonus was a fraction of what Cleveland paid Bracho ($1.5 million) and Valera ($1.3 million), and he already looks like a bargain. Rocchio hit his way to the United States as a 17-year-old last summer, finishing third in the Arizona League batting race (.343) as the rookie circuit's third-youngest qualifier.  Rocchio has advanced feel for hitting and pitch recognition, along with a sweet swing from both sides of the plate. He commands the strike zone but makes contact so easily that he doesn't draw many walks. While he's small and not physically mature, he has quick hands and snap in his wrists that should produce at least gap power.  Rocchio has plus speed and is very aggressive on the bases, so he could be a prolific basestealer once he improves his reads and jumps. His quickness and instincts give him solid range at shortstop, though his arm is merely average and might prompt an eventual move to second base.

Amaya's hands have life, and work in a tight little loop as he accelerates them to swing. He can pull and lift balls in various parts of the zone with regularity, and the impact of his contact is only limited by his average bat speed. The physical grind of catching is likely to dilute his in-game offensive production a little bit, but unless the beating he takes back there starts to take away from his defensive abilities (which sometimes happens to young catchers), Amaya is a pretty good bet to have some kind of big league career, and, if the bat maxes out, he'll be an above-average regular. He turns 20 in March and will likely head to Hi-A next year.

Amaya's defensive ability and makeup are the traits that initially attracted the Cubs, and he hasn't disappointed in those areas. He's a better receiver and moves better than most catchers his age, already showing the aptitude to frame and block pitches well.

At his best, Denaburg works 93-95 and hits 98 mph, and throws a plus curveball that's among the most consistent 60-grade curveballs you'll see from a teenager. He also has a rarely-used changeup that was used more and flashed 55-potential late in the spring, particularly in the region final when he twice used it to strikeout Red Sox first rounder Triston Casas. In addition to consistently throwing the best version of his curveball, Denaburg also located it well for his age, often down in the zone. His fastball also works best down due to his plane and the life on the pitch. Denaburg arguably could have been regarded as the best prep pitcher in his draft class if not for the biceps injury (which appears to have no long-term affect), so he could rise in 2019 relative to the prep pitching class if he can show that level of stuff over a longer period.\"","\"|\"","","\"WSH\"","\"2018, 1st (27) - WSH\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Denaburg intrigued scouts as an athletic catcher before emerging as one of top high school pitching prospects in the country ahead of his senior year. While biceps tendinitis limited Denaburg's time on the mound in the spring, the Nationals, long rumored to have interest in the Florida prep, took him with their first-round pick (No. 27 overall) and then signed him for $3 million, more than $500,000 above his slot's recommended value. The club cautiously chose not send him out for his pro debut, instead giving Denaburg extra rest until instructional league, where he drew rave reviews from those who saw him.  An athletic righty with two plus pitches and plenty of room to fill out, Denaburg has the look of a future big league starter. He's been up to 97 mph in the past with his fastball and typically sits 93-95, throwing his heater with good life down in the zone. His breaking ball is a high-spin-rate hammer, a plus pitch that he throws in the upper 70s with depth and finish, and he also shows feel for developing a changeup with average-or-better potential. Denaburg should have at least average control based on the merits of his sheer athleticism and clean arm action.   In addition to his two-way exploits on the diamond, Denaburg was also the kicker and punter on his high school's football team. Such a multi-sport, multi-position background underscores just how much upside Denaburg has left to unlock now that he's focused on pitching full time.

During the spring, Bohm steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. Bohm pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with Bohm's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with Kris Bryant an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting Bohm as a 50 bat with 60 game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the Phillies. Bohm's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, Bohm looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","\"2018, 1st (3) - PHI\"","","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 35 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  The summer before his junior year at Wichita State, Bohm had a strong Cape Cod League showing.

Ranked No. 7 among Draft prospects by MLB Pipeline, Bohm was taken No. 3 overall by the Phillies, as they believed him to be the best pure hitter in the Draft. He was having a relatively pedestrian pro debut last summer that was interrupted by a shin contusion caused by a pitch.    Bohm has the potential to hit for average as well as power at the highest level. He has strength and excellent bat speed to go along with excellent strike zone control. As a result, he can draw walks and doesn't strike out much, especially for someone who can generate plus raw power. The Phillies are excited to have him work with new hitting coordinator Jason Ochart and implement their more advanced program in 2019. While Bohm has worked on his defense at third, the jury is still out about whether he will be able to stay there. He did do a lot of agility and flexibility type of work during instructional league play after last season.    The Phillies are committed to him sticking at the hot corner and have been pleased to see him forge a strong bond with shortstop prospect Luis Garcia on and off the field.

He was touching 99 while throwing live BP, and sitting 92-96 during his starts in extended spring training. His 13-start Northwest/Sally League tour, during which he walked just 19 in 54 innings, was the first step toward quelling concerns about his viability as a starter, though we're still somewhat apprehensive here at FanGraphs.   Crouse's repertoire depth is not the issue. Based on his pitch usage during instructional league, his changeup seemed to be a developmental priority, and he has indeed made progress with it. It now comfortably projects to average, while Crouse's fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman.  He incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence on occassion. An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Scouts often sentence quirky, visibly fiery and emotional hurlers to late-inning duty, and we do think Crouse would thrive in such a role, but view these traits as positives. Crouse has a unique build and delivery, and is a very short strider whose 5-foot-4 extension sucks some of the perceived velo out of his fastball. This, plus the lower slot, might make him unusually vulnerable to lefties despite his velocity. This, his brief injury history, and still fringy command all contribute to a bundle of relief risk in our opinion.\"","\"|\"","","\"TEX\"","\"2017, 2nd (66) - TEX\"","","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  Few pitchers in the 2017 high school class could match Crouse's combination of stuff and track record of performance against top competition, but his volatile delivery and mound antics created enough concern that he lasted 66 picks in the Draft. Since the Rangers gladly pounced on him in the second round and signed him for an over-slot $1.45 million, he has been their best pitching prospect. They handled him carefully in his first two pro seasons, during which he logged a 1.93 ERA and a 31 percent strikeout rate.  A true power pitcher, Crouse blows away hitters with a fastball that parks in the mid-90s and repeatedly hits 99 mph with riding life that makes it even more difficult to barrel. He backs it up with a wipeout slider with mid-80s velocity and two-plane depth, and he shows the aptitude to manipulate it into a true curveball to give batters a different look. His changeup can be too firm at times but shows flashes of becoming an average third offering with some fade.  Crouse has a lot going on in his violent delivery, which finishes with some disconcerting head whack, yet he repeats it and keeps it in sync enough to find the strike zone on a regular basis. He's more animated than most pitchers, and he'll throw in a Johnny Cueto shimmy or groom the mound like Mark Fidrych at times. Though some scouts wonder if he can hold up as a starter, the Rangers are determined to develop him as one and believe he can become their ace of the future.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TEX\"","\"A\"","6","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (TEX)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"53.3\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","2.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2700","40","60","45","60","","","","45","60","55","70","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","45","","60","","","","50","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["127","125","131","59","602","\"50.9\"","\"49.9\"","\"51.4\"","\"48.8\"","\"39.7\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Ronaldo\"","\"Hernandez\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","2568","660613","","","\"sa881850\"","\"|\"","73","\"Colombia\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2022","50","\"i2Oumgt06Go\"","\"A plus-plus arm and big raw power drive Hernandez's high-ceiling profile.\"","\"Hernandez's career got off to a slow start in part due to his conversion (he was originally a SS/3B who the Rays asked to catch) but also due to injury, which cost him much of his first pro season.

He has since blossomed into the organization's top catching prospect, not to mention one of the better young backstops in the Minors, showing tools that give him impact potential on both sides of the ball. He raked in the Rookie-level Appalachian League during his 2017 stateside debut, finishing fifth on the circuit in both average (.332) and slugging (.507), then boosted his stock in his first full season by clubbing 21 home runs over 109 games at age 20 in the Class A Midwest League in '18.  Hernandez is a physically strong right-handed hitter who projects to hit for power and average at a premium position. He makes a lot of hard contact, exhibiting bat speed as well as a knack for barreling the baseball with good hand-eye coordination. He's added loft to his swing and began to tap into his plus raw power last season to finish second in home runs among Minor League catchers. That power is almost entirely to Hernandez's pull side, however, and some evaluators question his ability to hit to all fields. While he doesn't strike out much, Hernandez will need to tone down his aggressive approach and become more selective as he works his way through the Minors.   Hernandez has the type of plus arm strength and catch-and-throw skills needed to control a running game, but he'll need to make considerable gains with his receiving and blocking to stick behind the plate. Some of those improvements should happen naturally with experience, as Hernandez is still new to catching and learning the many nuances of the position.

He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to North Carolina to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school, fulfilling the rosiest hopes some had of him eventually putting it together on the baseball field, as multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually came to think that Adams' only athletic peer in recent draft history was Byron Buxton.   Adams is a true 80 runner with raw power who projects to be a 60, and who flashed body and bat control that reminded scouts of Royce Lewis. All of this excitement came with almost zero track record, and Adams didn't face much strong competition after NHSI, meaning drafting him would be based purely on old-school scouting, as there weren't years of video of and performance from this flourishing incarnation of Adams. Once teams became enthused enough that multiple millions of dollars were in play, it appeared clear that baseball could overtake football. Several GMs, including the Angels' GM Billy Eppler, were in after NHSI to see Adams for themselves, and after Adell and Adams were their top pick in consecutive years, rival executives now view this risk/upside kind of prospect as Los Angeles' type. That trend appears to be more the result of opportunistic good fortune than a deliberate strategy, since there's an argument to be made that Austin Beck (who went to Oakland sixth overall in 2017) had less upside and a similar performance record to Adams; if the industry had simply seen Adams play in an NHSI-style setting for a couple more weeks, he could have been a top five pick candidate, just like Royce Lewis or Byron Buxton were after a strong summer of performance. This is all to say that the sky is the limit for Adams, and if he performs well in Low-A in 2019, he'll shoot up this list.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2018, 1st (17) - LAA\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 80 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50    There have been some who have lamented the fact that baseball keeps losing top tier athletes to football.

It continued in 2018 when they took Adams, who could have kept playing both sports at North Carolina, in the middle of the first round and gave him an above pick value bonus of $4.1 million to give up football.    Adams has the potential to be an impact player on both sides of the ball, but still has a long way to go to get there. His coming out party baseball-wise came at USA Baseball's National High School Invitational, the first time he showed he could handle quality pitching, and the bat speed that was on display then continued on through his senior season and into his pro debut. As he continues to refine his approach, he has the chance to hit for a good amount of power. His top-of-the-scale speed should allow him to wreak havoc on the basepaths and cover a ton of ground in the outfield, though he still needs to learn the nuances of basestealing and improve his reads and routes in center field.    There were some encouraging signs from Adams during his pro debut, which was cut short by a broken jaw suffered in an outfield collision. Patience will be needed, but Adams could be right behind Jo Adell and Brandon Marsh as dynamic young outfielders making it to Los Angeles.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"A\"","5","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.5\"","\"56.4\"","\"51.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","50","80","45","45","50","50","60","80","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","80","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["130","128","130","115","133","\"50.8\"","\"49.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"52.6\"","\"37.5\"","\"54.0\"","\"|\"","\"Marco\"","\"Luciano\"","2019","\"17.7\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"178\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","2313","682617","","","","\"|\"","87","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","50","\"UrZDHmjnjrY\"","","\"Luciano's broad, square, muscular shoulders look like they belong to a D1 high school football prospect. He has one of the better frames of all the 17-year-old hitters in pro ball, and plenty of room to add power to a body that already produces a lot of it. Luciano has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age, and has taken his peers deep in games, too.   Luciano's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct that, he'll need to move to the outfield. If he can, this is a shortstop with 80 bat speed. Luciano is a potential superstar.

Out of the penalty box in 2018, they spent $2.6 million to land Luciano, the top-rated middle-infield prospect on the international market. They haven't signed a homegrown international All-Star since Pablo Sandoval in 2003 and believe Luciano could end that drought.  Some scouts considered Luciano the best all-around hitter in the 2018 international crop and the Dominican is advanced enough to make his U.S. debut at age 17 this year. He has exceptional bat speed from the right side of the plate and already has surprising strength in a wiry frame that has plenty of room to add more muscle. He has a mature approach, keeping his swing compact and using the entire field rather than worrying about home runs.  Luciano is a quick-twitch athlete with present above-average speed. He may slow down a bit as he matures physically, which leads to some questions as to whether he'll outgrow shortstop. He definitely has the plus arm for that position, and more than enough offensive upside to still be a star if he has to shift to third base or right field.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SFG\"","","3","\"2018 J2 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"33.6\"","\"55.5\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","20","20","60","50","40","50","50","60","70","50","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","50","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["131","129","104","148","85","\"50.8\"","\"50.4\"","\"49.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"48.7\"","\"53.8\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Weathers\"","2019","\"19.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","288","6","\"|\"","3077","677960","\"weathers_ryan\"","","\"sa3008436\"","\"|\"","","\"Loretto HS (TN)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","47","\"_NYKyhaRURs\"","\" \"","\"The Padres seemed to have the top tier of prep pitching in their mix at pick No. 7 during last year's draft.

William had his breakout in 2018 as a 20-year-old, going from a trendy pick to breakout to a consensus Top 100 prospect by mid-season. He has been defensively advanced for years, both in his tools and his mental approach to the game, in part due to help from his brother. William projects as an above average defender with a plus arm. Contreras has also gotten stronger and is growing into his man strength after establishing a feel to hit, so he has a well-rounded approach now. He toned down his swing in 2018 and is slowly adding elements as he feels comfortable, rather than making a noisier swing work all at once. Contreras stands out because there are not many 21-year-olds who project for average to above offense along with above average defense, and have the makeup/mental part of the game under control without any major red flags like injuries. The scouts who like Contreras really like him--rounding up on both the tool grades due to makeup and his overall value due to a high floor at a position that's a wasteland in the majors right now. This top 10 could be in almost any order, and Contreras may be the guy with the biggest variance as to where various baseball people rank him, which is a positive when his ranking peers are mostly MLB-ready, heavily-pedigreed prospects with much more track record.\"","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","","\"Feb. 10, 2015 - ATL\"","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Having MLB bloodlines can be a very good thing.

While Contreras the younger had a very successful first taste of full-season ball as a South Atlantic League All-Star in 2018, there's also been the flip side of that bloodlines coin, where he's fallen into the trap of believing he can do everything his more established sibling can.  Contreras has all of the tools to be a very successful all-around catcher at the big league level. While he is a bit of a free swinger and sometimes attacks pitches out of the zone more than he should, he has shown the ability to make hard contact and draw walks while relatively limiting his strikeouts. He's starting to come into a little more power as he learns what he needs to adjust at the plate, and the Braves were pleased that he was making those adjustments in his offseason work. Defensively, he's always had a strong arm and has plenty of agility to be a good blocker and receiver.   The biggest thing Contreras needs to learn is that there is a process to becoming a finished product behind the plate, like his brother. As he starts to buy into building the foundation of being able to be a complete receiver, and not think he's already like his older brother, the more he'll be able to develop into the big league starter the Braves envision.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ATL\"","\"AA\"","6","\"2014 J2 (ATL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.9\"","\"50.9\"","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","50","45","45","60","50","50","55","40","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","40","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["133","131","143","56","833","\"50.7\"","\"49.6\"","\"51.4\"","\"47.4\"","\"40.5\"","\"48.0\"","\"|\"","\"Nolan\"","\"Jones\"","2019","\"21.1\"","\"3B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","1670","666134","\"jones_nolan\"","","\"sa917941\"","\"|\"","65","\"Holy Ghost Prep HS (PA)\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2021","50","\"M8MOVqKoFgA\"","\"Jones swings and misses a lot and may need to move to right field, but he has hit for power each of the last two years and has some of the higher walk rates in the minors.\"","\"Scouts' opinions about where on the defensive spectrum Jones will end up are all over the map.

Some clubs think he'll move to right field, and the contact issues Jones has had due to his lever length are problematic if he doesn't stay at third.  We're intrigued by the three-true outcomes possibilities here, as Jones already has huge power and might grow into more, and he's also had some of the higher walk rates in all of the minor leagues. Opposing pitchers are going to have to be careful with him or risk paying a 400 foot price, so we expect his on base ability to hold water at the upper levels.

One of the better high school hitters in the 2016 Draft, he dropped to the second round amid signability concerns but landed first-round bonus money ($2.25 million). After a so-so pro debut, he led the short-season New York-Penn League with a .912 OPS in 2017, ranked third in the Class A Midwest League with an .858 mark last year and posted a .910 OPS during the final month in Class A Advanced.  Jones has an advanced approach at the plate, patiently working counts and using the entire field. He has a smooth left-handed swing and impressive feel to hit, and he shows the ability to produce high batting averages despite working deep counts that lead to some strikeouts. His bat speed and strength give him promising power potential that could produce 25 or more homers per season, especially if he adds some loft to a stroke that's currently more geared for line drives.  Though he's a below-average runner, Jones is a decent athlete and has worked hard to make the transition from amateur shortstop to pro third baseman. He has a strong arm and has improved his footwork, but still needs to increase his range in order to become an average defender at the hot corner.

He walked more than he struck out across three minor league levels, and rose to Triple-A and into our overall top 100. He had a similarly strong 2018, which included a Futures Game invite, a .390 OBP at Triple-A, and then a strong 30-game big league stint in August and September, all reinforcing that Jansen's 2017 breakout was legitimate. A solid if unspectacular defender, Jansen's pop times were depressed during his big league cameo, hovering between 2.05 and 2.10, both below average for a catcher. But he's an average receiver and ball-blocker, and is a perfectly acceptable defensive catcher without a disqualifying shortcoming.   Where Jansen shines is in the batter's box. His hands work in a tight loop, giving Jansen the capacity to catch velocity and still lift the baseball, and he's strong enough to muscle out balls to his pull-side, though to this point his approach has yielded more doubles than homers. He is a pull-only plodder and he'll likely always be a low BABIP guy, and it's possible major league pitchers will find ways to attack him in ways that limit his power output, but he's going to make a lot of contact and reach base, which, at catcher, could make him an All-Star.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"MLB\"","3","\"2013 Draft Rnd 16 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.0\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","40","55","30","45","40","55","45","55","30","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["135","133","140","57","779","\"50.7\"","\"49.7\"","\"51.4\"","\"47.7\"","\"41.8\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Cole\"","\"Tucker\"","2019","\"22.9\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","300","6","\"|\"","736","657061","\"tucker_cole\"","17326","\"sa828671\"","\"|\"","78","\"Mountain Pointe HS (AZ)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"lY4O7BtOreg\"","\"There's a chance Tucker, who is a lock to stay at shortstop, fills out his 6-foot-4 frame late and suddenly also has a lot of power.\"","\"Tucker was the Arizona Fall League's most elegant defender.

With such an excellent defensive foundation in place, it's very likely that Tucker becomes an everyday player. What happens with his bat will determine how much of an impact he makes, and that forecast is blurry. Right now, Tucker has surprising contact skills for someone as lanky as he is and he's adept at identifying balls and strikes. His size and currrent swing both have significant room for growth. Tucker's bat path enters the hitting zone in such a way that it causes him to pound the ball into the ground. If that gets tweaked, and he also adds strength into his mid-20s, he might suddenly start hitting for power. This is a rare, high-variance prospect who also has a high floor.

Aside from staying healthy, it's always been a matter of Tucker learning to control his 6-foot-3 frame consistently, especially offensively.

Late in the year and in the AFL, he was feeling his base better, driving the ball more consistently with extra-base authority. His plus speed plays up on the basepaths and in the field because of his outstanding instincts. He gets off the ball well, with good reads and more than enough arm for the premium position long term.

There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: Singer's stuff still isn't loud, he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters, his delivery turns off some scouts, and his breaking ball often lacks bite.   Even scouts who like Singer think he has limited upside, but the results he got in the SEC and his long track record of durability are compelling. He has great feel for pitching and, we think, future plus command. Singer sneers and goes right at hitters, he's really competitive, and is likely to move up the pro ladder quickly.

A three-year starter and star on a stacked Florida Gators pitching staff, Singer was rated No. 2 among Draft prospects by MLB Pipeline. While Singer didn't sign as a second-round pick of the Blue Jays because of a disagreement over a post-Draft physical, he proved to be durable for three seasons and the Royals were happy to draft him and give him an over pick-value bonus of $4,247,500 to sign. Because of his workload and a small hamstring issue, he didn't pitch competitively in 2018.    Singer attacks hitters with two pitches that have the chance to be consistently plus in his fastball and slider. It's really three when considering he throws both a two-seamer with sink and a four-seamer with riding life, that typically sit in the low-90s but can touch 95-96 mph at times. His slider is often a plus pitch, when he stays on top of it in his delivery, and he manipulates the speed and depth of the breaking ball to give hitters different looks. With those two pitches, he didn't need his changeup much, but he has shown some feel for it and given his overall pitching acumen, there's confidence it will give him a third at least average offering.    Using a slightly lower arm slot, Singer has shown excellent control and command that should continue in his pro career.

He's played mostly shortstop and third base in pro ball but scouts keep comparing his profile to Nick Castellanos' and think he ends up in left field.   There's some optimism that his arm will improve with a throwing program, or that he could play second base (which is worth a try), but usually these situations end with the player at the lower end of the defensive spectrum. Like Castellanos, Mountcastle also is a little too aggressive at the plate but has the bat control to keep his strikeout rates from getting too high. The projection here is something like a 55 bat and 55 power, maybe a bit less if the approach doesn't continue to improve, with below average speed and defensive value, wherever he ends up playing. We wish he were a little choosier at the dish -- that's a lower-risk, 2 WAR-type prospect. Mountcastle will start 2019 in Triple-A, so the wait shouldn't be long.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2015, 1st (36) - BAL\"","","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 40 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Mountcastle was revered by scouts for his potential with the bat as a Florida high schooler before the Orioles nabbed him with the second of their two first-round picks in 2015. That hitting ability has helped him move quickly through the Minors despite concerns about his defense, as Mountcastle raked his way up to Double-A at age 20 in '17. And even though the start of Mountcastle's '18 campaign was delayed due to a fractured right wrist suffered during Spring Training, he still put up strong numbers in the Eastern League and represented the Orioles at the Futures Game in July.   Mountcastle just knows how to impact the baseball. He has a quick bat and does an outstanding job of keeping his hands inside the ball to create extension through the zone and generate backspin carry to all fields. It gives him a chance to be at least an above-average hitter with similar power potential, especially if he can further refine his approach.  While the move up to Double-A brought a position change from shortstop to third base for Mountcastle, his below-average arm strength and fringy range made him unlikely to stay there long term. Sure enough, the Orioles began working him in at first base during Spring Training before deploying him primarily at the position at the outset of 2019. He's always had good hands on the left side of the infield that should serve him well as a first baseman, and he certainly has the hitting ability and power to profile there at the highest level .\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AAA\"","5","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","1","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.0\"","\"50.9\"","\"49.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","35","60","45","30","30","55","50","60","40","40","30","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","45","40","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["138","136","134","145","109","\"50.6\"","\"49.8\"","\"49.3\"","\"52.9\"","\"41.3\"","\"54.0\"","\"|\"","\"Brett\"","\"Baty\"","2019","\"19.5\"","\"3B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"210\"","\"draft\"","379","8","\"|\"","2823","","\"baty_brett\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Lake Travis HS (TX)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2022","47","","\"High school bat who is the age of most junior college hitters.

Not older than they were on draft day. Older than they are right now, and Baty is two years older than Day 1 prospect Kyren Paris. But tools-wise, he compares quite closely to Cardinals 2018 first rounder and top 100 prospect Nolan Gorman, and those tools belong in the middle of the first round. Baty is big, strong, and has huge power and advanced feel to hit. He may not be an athletic fit at third base, especially long term, and is at risk of moving to first. The age issue slides him a shade beneath where we had Gorman's FV last year, and we consider Baty's first pro summer, probably at an advanced rookie affiliate, to be of greater than usual importance in assessing his skills in an age-appropriate competitive environment.\"","\"|\"","\"Lake Travis (Texas) HS\"","","","","","55","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-brett-baty-3b-c2520532583?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 60 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Baty has several parallels to Josh Jung, a fellow Texas prep product who's now a third baseman at Texas Tech and expected to be one of the first college players selected in June. They're built similarly, they rank among the best all-around hitters in their respective high school and college classes and they still have to convince evaluators that they can stick at the hot corner. Baty may have passed Jung with a more impressive spring and his bat could land him in the middle of the first round.  Baty possesses some of the best raw power in the 2019 Draft, the product of bat speed, strength and loft in his left-handed swing. He's also more of an advanced hitter than just a pure masher. A Texas recruit who would be eligible for the 2021 Draft as a sophomore, he makes repeated hard contact, isn't fooled by breaking pitches and doesn't get caught selling out for power.  Though he clocks below-average running times, Baty is a better athlete than his lack of speed might indicate. He played basketball at Lake Travis High (Austin) and could remain a third baseman if he improves his agility and maintains the conditioning on his big frame.

The track record of Virginia arms is concerning, but Lynch seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious.   He throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus.

Targeting college pitching, the quartet of Brady Singer, Jackson Kowar, Kris Bubic and Lynch could form most of a big league rotation in a hurry. Lynch, the last of three first-round picks for Kansas City, opened a lot of eyes during his pro debut and perhaps put himself on a faster track than anticipated.  While it's important to temper enthusiasm over one summer debut, it's hard not to get excited about how Lynch's stuff ticked up as a pro, especially considering he nearly reached 140 innings between his junior season at Virginia and his time in the Minor Leagues. At times last summer, Lynch showed flashes of three plus pitches with plus command. He pitched at 94-95 mph consistently with his fastball, touching 97 mph, well up from his amateur velocity. He threw outstanding sliders and a very deceptive changeup while mixing in his average curve ball extremely well. His advanced feel for pitching and conviction of what he's doing on the mound made it all play up and he came in on right-handed hitters better than most young lefties.  Lynch set the bar high for his first full season after his pro debut, but the Royals are confident he can live up to his own expectations.

Developed as a starter to this point, he has well-below average control and likely wouldn't throw enough strikes to go more than two or three innings in a big league rotation. In relief though, he could be incredible. His fastball is hard and comes in with tough angle. It has natural cut when Hernandez is locating it to his glove side, and with it he misses bats away from lefties who swing inside its break. Both of his secondary offerings are capable of missing bats but the same mechanical repetition issues that plague Hernandez's command cause them to be inconsistent. At times, he'll flash a plus-plus breaking ball; at others, the pitch isn't located near enough to the plate to entice hitters. And so, projected roles for Hernandez vary depending on the evaluator's degree of confidence in his ability to tighten up his command.

Hernandez has the best pure stuff in the system, but he's still learning to harness it. He was dominant as a starter down the stretch last summer in Class A Advanced, then excelled as a reliever in Double-A and the Arizona Fall League.  Armed with three pitches that are well above average at their best, Hernandez averaged 9.9 strikeouts per nine innings through his first five years as a pro. His fastball ranges from 93-98 mph when he starts and sits in the upper 90s when he relieves, with late life that creates a lot of swings and misses as well as weak contact. His slider has edged past his curveball, in part because it's a better fit for his lower-three-quarters delivery, but his breaking pitches aren't as reliable as his fastball because he doesn't always stay on top of them.  Hernandez's changeup is a decent fourth pitch and helps him keep right-handers honest. There's some effort in his delivery, and while the Red Sox hope to groom him for their rotation, he has yet to demonstrate the command to fill that role.

He had a velocity dip after signing, which most seem to think stemmed from heavy usage in high school. That appeared to be the case, as his velocity was back up this spring after some training at Driveline.

Unlike most of their high school draftees, Muller wasn't ready for full-season ball right after his Draft year, instead spending the summer in the Rookie-level Appalachian League. Propelled by strong offseason workouts, he hit the ground running in 2018, pitching across three levels and finishing with a stint in the Arizona Fall League.  Muller was able to start moving more quickly because his velocity bounced back to closer to what scouts saw in his high school days. Some of that was because of Driveline workouts this offseason and some of it occurred as Muller consistently found his arm slot and utilized a much more athletic delivery. More free and easy, the left-hander hit 94-95 mph with his fastball consistently, though he would lose command at times when he cranked it up. He could get fastball-heavy at times, trying to blow the ball past hitters, and he needs to learn to more effectively mix in his secondary stuff.  More than anything, Muller needs to find a level of consistency.

They jumped at the chance to sign Gutierrez, who was No. 4 on MLB Pipeline's Top 30 International Prospects list when he got $4.75 million from the Reds to sign. After impressing early with his bullpen sessions and showing initial polish similar to fellow Cuban Raisel Iglesias, the right-hander appeared to get away from his strengths during a rocky first pro season in 2017.    The 2018 season was a nice step forward for Gutierrez. He did a good job of finding his delivery, which enabled him to stay on top of the ball better and created a better angle. As a result, he had better action on his pitches and a more consistent break on his curveball, which lost its sharpness when he would get under or on the side of the ball.    An improved tempo also increased Gutierrez's ability to pound the strike zone. With a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start, Gutierrez's fastball touches as high as 97-98 mph. By having a year where he turned the corner behind him, he might not be far from reaching the big leagues if there is continued refinement of his pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CIN\"","\"AAA\"","10","\"2016 J2 (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"52.5\"","\"51.7\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","2.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2700","45","50","40","60","","","","50","50","45","70","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","55","","","","","55","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["145","143","189","111","999","\"50.3\"","\"48.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"46.1\"","\"39.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","\"Tyler\"","\"Stephenson\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1265","663886","\"stephenson_tyler\"","","\"sa874242\"","\"|\"","81","\"Kennesaw Mountain HS (GA)\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"jbQ74U8MGvM\"","\"After he was injured for much of his first few seasons, Stephenson had his healthiest year to date and hit pretty well in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League.

Multiple GMs showed up to many of his late playoff games since they didn't have the same extensive history with him that they did with other top picks. Stephenson has a rare toolbox for a catcher, with a 70-grade arm and surprisingly advanced defensive skills for a 6-foot-4 backstop, along with plus raw power. Stephenson isn't a runner and his hit tool has been a little inconsistent, due to both his power-focused offensive approach and multiple injuries in pro ball (broken wrist, concussion).

There are many reasons to be high on Stephenson, especially because of his defense. Despite being a bigger guy at 6-foot-4, he doesn't look too big when he's set up behind the plate while offering a good target and showing excellent flexibility. One scout felt his hands were the best part of his defense. Stephenson still has length in his throwing mechanics, but has kept working to shorten his throws in order to maximize his plus arm strength, and is making progress calling games.    Still learning who he is as a hitter, Stephenson hits for average but has some raw power. He needs to figure out the breaking ball and how to hit it.

Switch-hitters with power are rare and Carlson has all-fields pop from both sides of the plate that, in 2018, was masked by the cavernous ballparks of the Florida State League. A waist-high leg kick and loose, active hands provide much of the thump, and Carlson is athletic enough to make use of a swing with that much movement and not have it negatively impacted his timing. Though he has limited bat control, Carlson is adept at picking hittable pitchces to attack, and cut his K% down to 17% in 2018 while maintaining his above-average 11% walk rate. Defensively, Carlson projects in right field. He saw ample time in center in 2016 and 2017 but really only played in either corner last year. There's a non-zero chance he thickens substantially through his mid-20s and loses the mobility to play the outfield, but that might also mean he's grown into more power than we're projecting and fits at first base--offensively anyway. There's a good chance Carlson turns into a solid everyday outfielder immune to modern pitching staffs' desire to exploit hitters' handedness.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2016, 1st (33) - STL\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 45 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Hailing from the Elk Grove High School program in northern California that his dad coached, Carlson was one of two first-round picks the Cardinals got at the end of 2016's opening round (Dakota Hudson was the other). Sent aggressively to full-season ball to start the '17 season, Carlson really struggled out of the gate, but righted the ship a bit after that, catching up to the level. Things began to come together for him in 2018, as he showed a mix of power potential and on-base skills at age 19 in the challenging Class A Advanced Florida State League.   Carlson has some serious offensive potential from both sides of the plate, with many evaluators believing he'll be able to get to an average hit tool because of his advanced approach. While his right-handed swing is more impactful and consistent, he has strong on-base skills from both sides that netted him a 12.5 percent clip in 2018, up from 11.5 percent in his first full season. That strong knowledge of the strike zone should allow him to find more pitches to drive and tap into his power, which could be average in his prime. A fringe-to-average runner, Carlson looks like he'll be athletic enough to play right field, where his strong arm that's piled up 25 assists in two full seasons profiles well.  Carlson has responded well to challenging assignments early in his career, and the Cardinals were especially pleased with his adjustments and overall performance in the Florida State League. With his high baseball IQ, feel for the strike zone and untapped potential at the plate, Carlson is on his way toward becoming an everyday big leaguer.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","3","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","40","55","50","45","55","45","55","60","40","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","45","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"LAA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["147","145","103","112","206","\"50.3\"","\"50.4\"","\"50.0\"","\"51.7\"","\"48.3\"","\"52.0\"","\"|\"","\"Luiz\"","\"Gohara\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"265\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","80","627894","","15166","\"sa723875\"","\"|\"","63","\"Brazil\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","50","\"d7MfWIXABS8\"","\"Gohara dealt with off-field adversity in 2018, so scrap the stats and just look at the stuff: rare lefty starter velocity and a plus slider.\"","\"Gohara has had an up-and-down couple of years; he's dealt with serious health issues and death in his immediate family, and living far away from home, along with some relatively less important professional matters, has also proven to be burdensome. A series of off-the-field issues and maturity concerns led the Mariners to sell low on him in the trade that brought him to Atlanta. He has a frame along the lines of a Prince Fielder or a CC Sabathia in that he looks unathletic when static, but you can see he's deceptively athletic for his size. Gohara has reportedly recently lost a lot of weight and gotten into the best shape of his life (alarm sound). He has high octane stuff with a plus fastball/slider combo and a changeup that's come to be average, along with better control and command than you might expect from a young power pitcher. Gohara is very close to losing eligibility, but he may be the rare case of a player who actually demonstrates in March that the changes he's made are real and moves up a list, since it's hard to upgrade a guy based on verbal reports that he's making progress in non-competitive environments.\"","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","","\"Aug. 14, 2012 - SEA\"","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Ever since the Mariners signed Gohara out of Brazil for $800,000 in 2012, he's tantalized with an electric left arm, but he has struggled to find a level of consistency. It looked like he started to figure things out in 2016, and the Braves acquired him the January after that season and watched him go from the Florida State League all the way to Atlanta in one season. A combination of family tragedy, poor conditioning and injuries, however, made the 2018 season a lost one for the left-hander.  Gohara is blessed with one of the most exciting left arms in the game and has learned that he can't just simply show up and find success at the highest levels. He began the 2018 season on the shelf with an ankle injury and finished it on the DL with shoulder soreness, with the fact that he wasn't in very good shape certainly not helping his cause. When he's right, he has a lethal two-pitch combination with his fastball and slider. His velocity dipped in 2018, but he has a track record of consistently touching 97-98 mph, and his slider has been a true out pitch in the past. He'll flash an average changeup at times.  One key to future success will be his ability to command the baseball so he can pitch deeper into games as a starter. He'll always be a big-bodied guy, but he's lost a lot of weight this offseason looking to put 2018 in the rear view mirror.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ATL\"","\"AAA\"","7","\"2012 J2 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2500","45","50","45","","60","","","50","60","50","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","45","","60","","","","50","\"LAN\"","0.925","\"2nd\""],["148","146","151","143","317","\"50.2\"","\"49.2\"","\"49.3\"","\"50.6\"","\"42.2\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","\"Josh\"","\"Jung\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"215\"","\"draft\"","379","8","\"|\"","2822","","\"jung_josh\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Texas Tech\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2022","47","\"RlBShzGPoCY\"","\"Compact oppo-geared swing with power, has performed, stays at third.

One of the more well-rounded offensive players in the college ranks, he should join Donald Harris as the only first-round picks in Tech history.  Jung has a controlled approach at the plate, repeatedly barreling balls to all fields with a sound right-handed swing. The Big 12 Conference co-player of the year, he lets his power come naturally and his bat speed and strength should translate into 25 or more homers per year once he turns on more pitches. He manages the strike zone very well and has no shortcomings in his offensive game.  Though Jung is a below-average runner, he's reasonably athletic and makes enough plays at third base.

His approach and early-career maturity issues (which have improved but still exist) slowed his development a bit and he only has half a season at Double-A despite being 23 and having played pro ball for six seasons. But Siri has great bat speed, power, and an innate feel for impacting the bottom of the baseball and lifting it into the air. If he weren't so aggressive (he appeared to be under a mandate to see more pitches in 2018) he'd be an easy plus future hit, plus future power center field prospect in the middle of our top 100. But the volatility created by the impatience, combined with Siri's noticeably thicker 2018 frame, has created apprehension. His upside is huge, but so is the risk. Ultimately, he shares many traits with Phillies outfielder Nick Williams (though Siri's a better defender by a wide margin), and, like Williams, Siri might just be such an amazing offensive talent that he'll be fine eventually despite his issues and several developmental bumps in the road.  \"","\"|\"","","\"CIN\"","","\"Sept. 21, 2012 - CIN\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 70 | Arm: 65 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  After he put it all together during a breakout 2017 -- which included 20 homers and 40 stolen bases, not to mention a Midwest League record 39-game hitting streak -- Siri initially struggled in 2018. A left thumb ligament injury suffered early during Spring Training games when he crashed into the wall trying to make a catch made it tough for him to get on track.      Brimming with tools and athleticism, Siri could play center field in the Major Leagues right now. With Billy Hamilton departed, there is no center fielder in the system who can get to a fly ball or line drive like Siri can. And his cannon arm also enables him to be a good right fielder. Offensively, he has well above-average raw power, but he still lacks in pitch selection and discipline while being super-aggressive at the plate, keeping him from tapping into that power consistently. Eric Davis has been working with him and had Siri move his hands down on the bat to create more leverage. He possesses great bat speed and can create good backspin on the ball.    Now is the time for Siri to put it all together, especially after seven years in the organization and being 23 years old. On any given day, a scout could give him 70 and 80 grades across the board.

Groshans isn't quite the same level athlete as Donaldson, and there are contact concerns with an active swing like that, but there are some bat-to-ball skills and plenty of mistake power he can already tap into, as shown in a loud debut in the GCL.

They signed him for below-slot value at $3.4 million, which in turn allowed the club to also sign third-rounder Adam Kloffenstein, Groshans' teammate at Magnolia. Regarded by scouts as one of the better prep hitters in his class, Groshans furthered his reputation with a torrid start to his pro career in the Gulf Coast League, hitting .331 with 39 RBIs in 37 games before a late promotion to the Appalachian League.   With his plus bat speed and an explosive but well-balanced right-handed swing, Groshans has no issues with velocity and consistently barrels the ball. His advanced approach fuels his ability to hit to all fields, and he made a lot of hard, line-drive contact from line to line during his pro debut. Those qualities lead scouts to project Groshans as an above-average big league hitter, and it's possible that he could also develop plus power as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame and adds some loft to his swing.   An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, Groshans is athletic for his size but isn't a lock at shortstop.

We don't think his fastball is going to miss as many bats as you might expect given it's velocity. It's a mid-90s bowling ball sinker with well-below average spin rate. This should pair well with Sheffield's changeup, but it may not effectively set up his slider, which on its own is excellent.

He spent the next two seasons working his way up to New York, making his big league debut in '18, but was on the move again in November as part of the James Paxton deal.    Sheffield has added some velocity since he entered pro ball and now features a fastball that he throws in the 92-97 mph range, and it has good run and sink to it at its best.

It would be much easier for Long to profile were he to stay at second base, where big leaguers slashed a collective .254/.317/.395 (good for a 93 wRC+) in 2018. The outfield corners are not so kind. Ultimately, Long has some power and his thunderous uppercut swing is going to enable him to get to it in games, even if his contact profile is fringy. That will play everyday at second base so long as he can. Since acquiring him, the Mariners have used Shed at second, third, and in left field. He's looked pretty good at third for not having played there and he's hit well in big league spring training games.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2013, 12th (375) - CIN\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  Long began his professional career with the Reds as a catcher, with the Jacksonville, Fla., native spending his first two summers of pro ball at rookie levels behind the plate after being a 12th-round Draft pick in 2013. The combination of raw defensive skills and advanced abilities at the plate led the Reds to move Long to second base and he hit his way up to Double-A, not to mention the 40-man roster following the 2017 season. He was part of the package for Sonny Gray sent to the Yankees, who then turned around and dealt him to the Mariners for outfield prospect Josh Stowers.  The Mariners believe in Long's bat and see him as the second baseman of the future in the organization. Compact and strong, he's shown a consistent ability to drive the ball from the left side of the plate, with quick hands generating the bat speed for solid power numbers. There will always be some swing and miss to his game, but he also draws a fair amount of walks. While far from a burner, he's a very good baserunner who has the ability to steal some bases.  The biggest question about Long is his glove, which has been fringy at best. Getting to work with infield instructor Perry Hill and veteran Dee Gordon should help him maximize his defensive value and enhance the chances he can live up to those expectations as a big league regular.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AAA\"","6","\"2013 Draft Rnd 12 (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.1\"","\"48.6\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","40","55","55","40","50","45","50","55","55","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","50","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["153","151","150","109","656","\"50.1\"","\"49.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.5\"","\"44.1\"","\"48.9\"","\"|\"","\"Yu-Cheng,Yu\"","\"Chang\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","780","644374","","","\"sa830276\"","\"|\"","103","\"Taiwan\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"VDPqWbix08\"","\"Chang is a versatile infielder with power who may see lots of big league time this year now that Yandy Diaz has been traded.\"","\"Teams have likely already studied this, but during our in-person looks at Chang, which date back to 2014, he seems to generate top spin on batted balls with more regularity than is typical for hitters. That's not a good thing, as the same way a curveball does, it causes Chang's fly balls to sink and die at a lesser distance than they should. We have no idea if the ability to hit balls with no spin (which is ideal) is a skill hitters have, but if it is, Chang probably isn't one of them.

He earned league all-star honors four times in his first five pro seasons despite perennially being young for his circuit, including being the youngest batting qualifier (age 22) in the Triple-A International League in 2018. Blocked at shortstop by Francisco Lindor in Cleveland, he boosted his stock by starring in the Arizona Fall League while playing third base.  Chang is atypical for a middle fielder in that his raw power might be his most impressive tool. He has a quick right-handed swing with good leverage and strength, and he has feel for backspinning the ball to all fields. His aggressive approach leads to doubles and home runs but also strikeouts, so he probably won't hit for a high average.  An average runner, Chang isn't a threat on the bases but gets the job done at shortstop. He has reliable hands, solid arm strength and a good internal clock.

Quite soft-bodied as an amateur, Ornelas has reshaped his physique and is now a svelte 6-foot-3 and an average runner underway, and it plays a little better than that on the bases because he is a max-effort player. Most amateur scouts had him projected to first base, but he now has a chance to not just stick in a corner outfield spot, but perhaps be above-average there.   Really what Ornelas is best at is hitting. He has terrific timing and feel for contact, as well as a growing idea of which pitches to attack to hit for power. His ground ball rate was down last year and while there's still room for growth in this area, the fact that Ornelas has already shown movement here is a sign more will come. Unless the hit and power tools grow beyond what we expect, it's unlikely that Ornelas becomes a star, but we consider him a strong bet to be an everyday big leaguer, and his makeup and polish make him an unusually high-probability bet in our estimation.\"","\"|\"","","\"SD\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - SD\"","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Signed from the same Mexico Red City Devils team that produced Luis Urias and Andres Munoz, Ornelas landed a $1.5 million bonus from the Padres in 2016. In a system that has no shortage of homegrown position-playing prospects from the international ranks, it's Ornelas who might have the highest ceiling. He offered a taste of his abilities in 2017 during his pro debut, slashing .276/.399/.408 with 17 extra-base hits and a 16.8 percent walk rate in the Rookie-level Arizona League. In 2018, he recorded a .732 OPS as an 18-year-old, punching well above his weight in the often-tricky Midwest League.  At 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, Ornelas shows the makings an impact player with his size, athleticism and array of tools. He's a very advanced hitter with a fluid but explosive left-handed swing. Ultimately, it could translate to above-average power as Ornelas grows into his projectable frame and learns to hit the ball in the air. He hasn't quite tapped into that raw power just yet, but he's well beyond his years with his approach. Ornelas has a knack for recognizing pitches and a willingness to take a walk.  Ornelas has played some center field at the lower levels, but he's unlikely to stay there. He's a fringe-average runner and could lose a step with physical development.

First, he and Felipe Vasquez were sent from Washington to Pittsburgh for Mark Melancon. Then he and Sherten Apostel were traded to Texas for Keone Kela last year.   After dealing with severe injury issues as an amateur -- he suffered from a strained UCL in high school and had a screw put in his elbow as a college freshman after suffering two humeral fractures -- as well as more minor maladies as a pro, Hearn was healthy for all of 2018 and threw more innings in a single season than at any point in his career. He struck out 140 hitters in 129 innings at Double-A. He remains a fairly spotty strike-thrower, but his three-pitch mix should enable him to continue to start, though probably as a 120 or 130-inning type rather than a true workhorse, which also makes sense considering Hearn's health history. He has rare lefty starter velocity and generally sits 93-96. A 95 mph average fastball would rank third among southpaw starters in baseball, just behind James Paxton and Blake Snell. Hearn can dump in his average curveball for strikes and his changeup has slowly turned into an average pitch, too. The cambio may yet have some developing to do as Hearn worked more heavily off his breaking ball early in his career and has lost a lot of reps due to injury. He profiles as a fastball-centric No. 4 or 5 starter for us, though there's a large subset of teams who think he ends up in the bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","\"TEX\"","\"2015, 5th (164) - WSH\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  Hard-throwing left-handers always attract scouts and Hearn lit up radar guns enough to get selected in four consecutive Drafts: by the Pirates in the 22nd round in 2012 out of a Texas high school, by the Reds in the 36th round in 2013 and the Twins in the 25th round in 2014 at San Jacinto (Texas) JC, and the Nationals in the fifth round in 2015 out of Oklahoma Baptist, an NAIA program. Washington sent him to Pittsburgh a year later as part of a package for Mark Melancon, and the Rangers acquired him last July along with third baseman Sherten Apostel for Keone Kela.   Hearn's fastball sits in the mid 90s when he starts and has tickled triple digits, featuring riding action and high spin rates that get swings and misses up in the strike zone. Hitters who gear up for his heater are vulnerable to his changeup, which can be a plus pitch at times. He never has had great feel for spinning a breaking ball from his low-three-quarters arm slot, but he's making progress with an 82-85 mph slider that still gets slurvy.  Despite a history of elbow issues as an amateur, Hearn hasn't had any arm problems as a pro, though he has missed time with foot (2016) and oblique injuries (2017). He stayed healthy last year, worked a career-high 129 innings and improved his control and command, all developments that enhance his chances of remaining a starter. If he heads to the bullpen, his fastball might park in the upper 90s and make him a late-inning factor.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TEX\"","\"MLB\"","8","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (WAS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"50.0\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2200","40","60","50","50","","","","45","60","55","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","55","","50","","","","45","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["156","154","219","280","335","\"50.0\"","\"47.6\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.4\"","\"47.5\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Anthony\"","\"Kay\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"218\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1724","641743","\"kay_anthony\"","","\"sa738470\"","\"|\"","","\"UConn\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2021","45","\"AUx6Z17xG94\"","","\"21 months elapsed between when Kay signed his pro contract and when he finally threw a pitch in affiliated ball.

During conference tournament play, Kay threw a complete game, then pitched again during the tournament on three days rest; he threw 90 pitches amid an hour-long lightning delay. It was unsurprising when he blew out in the fall of 2016. When Kay finally returned last year, he looked markedly different than he did in college when he was a lefty changeup monster with mediocre velocity. Kay's fastball has ticked up and now sits at about 93 mph instead of peaking there, and his two-plane breaking ball is better. His once-dominant changeup has regressed.

Making his long-awaited pro debut in 2018, Kay looked like a typical quick-to-the-big-leagues college lefty, showing an improved three-pitch mix while splitting the season between Class A Columbia and Class A Advanced St. Lucie.   In his return to the mound, Kay sat at 92-94 mph and occasionally reached the mid-90s with his high-spin-rate fastball. His changeup was his best secondary option at UConn but has taken a backseat in pro ball to a plus curveball in the low 80s that also has an elite spin rate and hard, downer action. His changeup is still an above-average pitch, one that plays nicely off his fastball with its late sinking action. He has feel for his craft, with solid control and command that should continue improve as he gains experience.  The hope for Kay in 2018 was to get through his first pro season healthy and amass about 100 innings. He checked those boxes and more, logging 122 2/3 frames and finishing on the cusp of Double-A.

In the event that he does have to move off of third base, Potts' lack of plate discipline makes his profile very risky, though he seemed to take a step forward in that regard last year. he turned 20 during his Arizona Fall League stint and should spend all year at Double-A. His low-end outcome is in the Juan Francisco/Matt Davidson realm, while a middle of the road projection is that of a big power/low on-base corner outfielder, a skillset Padres fans are familiar with because that's what Hunter Renfroe is.

His power surge continued in 2018, when he homered 21 times between two levels of the Minors and the Arizona Fall League. Perhaps more noteworthy: His walk rate ticked up, and his strikeout rate ticked down.   Potts makes hard contact at the plate, with a quick right-handed bat and plenty of strength to his frame.

That's why Stott, who looks and plays a lot like Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford, was high on lists entering this spring. The UNLV product has continued to perform as a junior, cementing his status as a potential top 10 pick.    Nearly all of Stott's tools grade out as at least above-average. He has the chance to be a plus hitter, with very advanced bat to ball skills. He's never overmatched and always seems comfortable in the box, handling good velocity and offspeed stuff equally well, while walking more than he's struck out in his college career. Even when he's off-balance, he keeps his hands back and shoots the ball the other way to left field. And while he'll never sell out his hit tool for power, he'll show pop in batting practice and it's easy to dream on 15-18 homers annually at the next level.     While Stott does show off a plus arm at times, the one area there's a split camp might be his ability to play shortstop in the big leagues.

The Twins liked his offensive profile enough to make him the 20th overall selection of the Draft and after his long college postseason run, he turned in a solid pro debut, reaching full-season ball even though he was running out of gas.  Larnach had shown an advanced approach at the plate and the ability to hit for average as a sophomore and in the Cape Cod League, but took a huge step forward as a prospect when he added power to his resume thanks to some tweaks to his swing mechanics. The added power hasn't taken anything away from him potentially being a plus hitter, one who draws walks and doesn't strike out a ton, when all is said and done.   Larnach's above-average arm works well from the outfield and he looked fine in right field during his debut, though some feel his below-average speed will land him left.

He spent four years at various levels of rookie ball and barely pitched, only throwing about 40 affiliated innings per year on average. The 38 innings he threw at Low-A to round out 2018 were dominant, as Abreu recorded 68 strikeouts, most of which were accrued with either of his two excellent breaking balls, which he has better feel for locating than he does his mid-90s fastball.   There's considerable industry doubt regarding Abreu's ability to start, the result of several factors. The lack of total innings creates reasonable doubt about him handling a 140-plus inning workload, and the lack of fastball command, along with Abreu's mediocre changeup, are also cited as pitfalls. As long as Abreu's breaking ball command refines though, he may have the tools to attack lefties and get ahead of hitters even if these other components are sub-optimal. His 40-man addition makes it more likely that he spends the early part of his big league career in the bullpen, but he may be a dominant multi-inning piece and could evetually transition into the rotation.

Abreu possesses the best curveball in the system, an absolute hammer with high spin rates and quality depth that club officials compare to that of Lance McCullers Jr. Abreu can also flash a wipeout slider at times, though with less consistency, and sets up both breaking balls with a four-seam fastball that ranges from 92-96 mph with running life. He blew away right-handers in 2018, striking out 52 percent while holding them to a .380 OPS.  His ability to refine his nascent changeup will play a large part in determining whether Abreu's long-term role is as a starter or a reliever.

Intrigued by his untapped potential, the Brewers made him their third-round pick in 2016, signing him for a shade over $400,000. After reaching Class A Wisconsin in his pro debut, Brown excelled in his return to the Midwest League in 2017 and received a late-season promotion to Class A Advanced Carolina, where he put a bow on his first full season with four solid outings. Moving up to Double-A in 2018, Brown broke out as he garnered honors as the Southern League's Most Outstanding Pitcher after he posted a circuit-best ERA (2.44) and finished second in WHIP (1.06) and BAA (.210).   Brown confidently attacks hitters on both sides of the plate with a 92-95 mph fastball and holds his velocity deep into starts. He adeptly manipulates the pitch as dictated by the situation, as he'll either turn it over to create sinking action to induce weakly hit ground balls -- something he did at a 55.6-percent clip in 2018 -- or reach back for some extra velo to get whiffs with his four-seamer. His curveball is his best offering, a plus pitch, and he also has feel for a promising changeup that contrasts nicely against his heater.  The Brewers have long been impressed with Brown's competitiveness on the mound and, more importantly, his ability to make adjustments and improve the deeper he worked into games. His delivery isn't the cleanest but also doesn't cost him control or command, so he should be able to remain a starter.

The North Carolina native who moved to IMG for his senior year of high school has the makings of four solid pitches and improved consistency in using them throughout a start. He regularly runs his fastball up to 96 mph and has shown an ability to maintain that velocity deeper into starts this spring. He now features two distinct breaking pitches, with a plus slider a big reason for his step forward. It's a true out pitch and it's better than his average curve, which is a bigger 11-to-5 breaker when he maintains his high three-quarter arm slot. He has feel for his changeup, though he can slow his arm a bit on it at times.     After starting the spring looking like the thrower he was over the summer, he's made strides towards being a more complete pitcher with improved command.

His vertically oriented release point makes it hard for him to work his fastball east and west, and several teams had him evaluated as a future reliever before the draft because they saw a lack of fastball command. But this vertical release also enables him to effectively change hitters' eye level by pairing fastballs up with breaking balls down, and he has a plus breaking ball. Woods Richardson works so quickly that it often makes hitters uncomfortable, though scouts love it. He's also shown some nascent changeup feel, but it will be hard to turn the cambio over consistently from his arm slot. Though he was one of the 2018 draft's youngest prospects, his frame is pretty mature, so we're not rounding up on the fastball even though he's still a teenager. His reasonable floor is that of a high-leverage or multi-inning reliever (a role that would seem to suit his fiery on-mound presence), but if a third impact pitch develops he could be a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2018, 2nd (48) - NYM\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  A strong showing on the summer showcase circuit put Woods-Richardson firmly on the Draft prospect map, looking for sure like a top-three-rounds pick. He didn't back that up during his senior year, causing some teams to back off. The Mets weren't one of them, remembering his summer dominance when they took him in the second round. They gave Woods-Richardson an above-pick-value bonus of $1.85 million to sign him away from his Texas commitment, then watched him dominate over five scoreless outings in the Gulf Coast League and finish his pro debut as a 17 year old in the Appalachian League.  After running his fastball up to 95 mph during the summer, Woods-Richardson sat more around 89-92 as a senior. But with his size, arm speed and athleticism, it was seemingly only a matter of time until velocity returned, and he spent his pro debut sitting around 93, while touching 97 with a riding fastball. Woods-Richardson's quick arm from a high-three-quarters slot helps him snap off a sharp, top-to-bottom curveball that shows plus potential, and he already demonstrates some feel for turning over an effective changeup.  Woods-Richardson has a good delivery and repeats it well, but he'll need to show he can maintain his stuff deep into his outings and handle the rigors of a full season to remain a starter long term.

Alzolay may have also had some health issues during his breakout 2017. He was given extended rest throughout July and August, his starts often spaced out by six days. He didnt throw more than 80 pitches in any August start and was shut down late in that month, then asked to pick up innings in the Arizona Fall League. He has this system's best two-pitch mix, a fastball/power curveball combo that is ready for a major league bullpen as soon as Alzolay is healthy. To profile in a rotation, he will need a better changeup than the one he has shown in the past; missing several months of action with his lat issue likely slowed that process.

We have eyeball reports that Diaz struggled to turn on pitches this year and has adopted more of a line drive approach, each of which is backed up by data, as his ground ball rate is up and his pull rate is down. These issues may have been timing-related, perhaps the lingering effects from the concussion, rather than the result of a mechanical change. Diaz still projects as a three-true-outcomes hitter who plays a premium defensive position. He has a 12% career walk rate as a pro and plus raw power we feel confident Diaz will get to in games given how readily he hit the ball in the air. Diaz isn't great at second base, but his mediocre range can be aided by proper defensive positioning, and his arm strength should enable him to make the longer throws demanded of second baseman by shifts. His arm would play at third base, too, though Diaz has never played there. There's some risk he underperforms with the bat and is a mediocre defensive second baseman, but because of his power and patience, his floor seems to look like Yoan Moncada's 2018 season, which was good for 2 WAR.

A polished strike-thrower with four good pitches, he reached Double-A as a 19-year-old back in 2017 before he became the centerpiece of the Justin Verlander deal. Advanced though he was, various injuries have robbed Perez of innings. He has yet to throw more than 86 frames in an entire season, so while he may be fairly advanced for someone his age, and definitely for someone who has pitched so little, the industry has yet to see his stuff hold up for a whole summer of starter's innings.

An ominous trap issue popped up during the early parts of 2019 spring training but Perez was back on the mound quickly and sitting his usual 93-96 into late-March. A strong-bodied 21-year-old, the cement is likely dry on Perez's stuff. His high three-quarters slot creates ride to his fastball as well as downward vertical action on his curveball, and those two traits typically pair well together. While Perez's curveball is his prettiest pitch, his best secondary offering is the changeup. There are times when Perez will come across the baseball and create screwball action on the change, and it runs, sometimes unhittably, onto the glove side corner of the plate.

He subsequently blossomed into one of the organization's better pitching prospects and had already reached Double-A at age 19 in '17 before being the marquee prospect sent to the Tigers in the Justin Verlander trade at the end of August. The high expectations for Perez's 2018 Tigers debut were quickly dashed by a lat strain that kept him out until late June, and he pitched only 19 1/3 innings upon returning before the club shut him down for the year in late July with right shoulder inflammation. Following the season, Perez was added to the Tigers' 40-man roster.  Perez has four pitches at his disposal when he's healthy, all of which he can throw for strikes. He generally throws his lively fastball in the 92-94 mph range, but he can reach back for 95-96 mph when he needs to. Added velocity could come as he matures. He can really spin his curveball, a future plus offering, and he's taken to a relatively new slider as well. He throws his above-average changeup with solid fade. With an athletic and repeatable delivery, he should continue to command the ball well even if he adds velocity.  Perez used his time on the shelf to add strength to his already strong frame, and he was able to resume throwing off flat ground with no ill effects in December. The Tigers expect him to be fully healthy for Spring Training. He still has a relatively high floor as a mid-rotation-type starter, albeit with concerns about his long-term durability.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"A+\"","6","\"2014 J2 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"54.3\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2500","40","60","55","45","50","","","50","60","60","50","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","60","50","","","","55","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["168","166","238","426","63","\"49.8\"","\"47.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"53.7\"","\"49.3\"","\"54.1\"","\"|\"","\"Griffin\"","\"Canning\"","2019","\"23.1\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","895","656288","\"canning_griffin\"","19867","\"sa829807\"","\"|\"","","\"Arizona State\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2021","40","\"eGtbuLx_2jg\"","","\"Canning's junior year at ASU got off to a roaring start and, because so much of the scouting industry is in Arizona in February and March, he was quickly seen by lots of decision makers.

He ended his junior year with a .369/.426/.648 line.

They were able to get the right-hander in the second round and then, after not having him pitch that first summer as a precaution, streak all the way up to Triple-A in his first full season of pro ball.    While size and a lack of premium stuff might limit Canning's ceiling a bit, his combination of athleticism, solid stuff and feel for pitching gives him a higher floor than many pitching prospects. He has a four-pitch mix with the chance of having all four being at least Major League average. He's added a couple of ticks on his fastball and averaged just over 94 mph with his heater in 2018. His secondary stuff has improved as well. Both of his distinct breaking balls have the chance of eventually being plus pitches, with some liking the curve a bit more than the slider at present. Canning throws his changeup with very good deception and he's shown the ability to set up hitters well and throw all four of his pitches for strikes thanks to a very repeatable delivery.    At times in 2018, Canning was guilty of overthrowing, especially when he got to Triple-A, which led to some command issues both in and out of the strike zone. No one expects that to be a long-term concern and Canning's ability to learn and make adjustments should have him ready to impact a big league staff as a mid-rotation starter soon.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"MLB\"","11","\"2018 Draft Rnd 5 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"39.1\"","\"46.4\"","","\"48.6\"","\"55.0\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","50","60","45","45","40","45","50","60","50","45","\"|\"","","2200","2500","45","55","45","50","55","","","55","55","55","50","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","60","55","","","","55","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["169","167","128","140","158","\"49.8\"","\"49.9\"","\"49.3\"","\"52.3\"","\"45.7\"","\"52.9\"","\"|\"","\"Hunter\"","\"Bishop\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"210\"","\"draft\"","379","8","\"|\"","1737","","\"bishop_hunter\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Arizona State\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","47","","\"Super athletic XL-framed corner outfielder who turned the corner at the plate.

He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into Phoenix's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over top of -- lots of Pac-12 breaking balls. Whether this is fixable has been the subject of many debates in draft rooms in the early first round. Bishop has rare physical tools for a college hitter. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion with solid feel for center field and huge, playable power, so there's a chance for stardom here even if Bishop ends up with a below-average hit tool. It's unclear why Bishop's arm strength and accuracy became issues this year after they were assets earlier in his career, but it's such a small aspect of his skillset that it shouldn't be a concern unless his medical indicates it's a chronic issue.

For his first two years, Bishop showed glimpses of tools, but with the same issues that plagued him as a prepster. His junior year, however, has been a revelation, and he's put himself near the top of the college bats eligible to be drafted.    Bishop's transformation came soon after he returned from his stint in the Cape Cod League, showing a new stance and rhythm at the plate during fall ball he has stuck with since. The left-handed hitter has always had tremendous raw power, but there have been questions about his ability to hit enough to tap into it. There will be some swing and miss, but he's shown bat speed, strength and loft consistently, with majestic home run power to his pull side, but also the ability to drive the ball to all fields. He runs very well for his size, regularly recording plus times down the line. That speed works in center field, with many scouts thinking he can stick there, even though this is the first time he's played there full-time.    The only negative at all with Bishop now is a lack of a track record of success. His ability to stick to his gameplan consistently this season, to go along with his natural tools, has nearly everyone believing it's for real, lining him up for an early first-round selection.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SFG\"","","4","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","10","10","\"SFG\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","\"43.6\"","\"53.2\"","\"52.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","40","65","60","45","30","45","60","65","55","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","60","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["170","168","129","103","267","\"49.8\"","\"49.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"51.0\"","\"44.4\"","\"51.6\"","\"|\"","\"Tristen\"","\"Lutz\"","2019","\"20.8\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","2015","669157","\"lutz_tristen\"","","\"sa3004968\"","\"|\"","93","\"Martin HS (TX)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","50","\"HD5Gdv4-45Q\"","\"After a rough start, Lutz had a solid 2018.

Already at physical maturity, Lutz's huge power is the foundation of his profile. He's capable of hitting long home runs to left and center, and he has the raw strength to drive out mis-hit balls the opposite way. Everything else he does is average. Adept at identifying breaking balls in mid air, Lutz's moderate swing-and-miss issues stem from his mediocre bat control. This might limit his game power output, but the issues aren't so bad that we're worried about Lutz not hitting entirely. He has below-average range and instincts in right field, but his arm is plus.

He was a standout during his pro debut in the Pioneer League, slashing .311/.398/.957 with nine home runs, and continued to show a blend of hitting ability and power in his first full season, coming on strong after a slow start in the cold-weather Midwest League.   Athletic and strong, Lutz has a real chance of developing at least average tools across the board. His right-handed power is his calling card, and he tapped into it promisingly at Class A Wisconsin, totaling 49 extra-base hits including 13 home runs. He stands to add even more pop as he adds strength needed to his impressive frame and learns to leverage the ball more consistently. He should hit for some average, too, as Lutz recognizes pitches well and uses the whole field better than most players his age.  An average runner, Lutz gets the most out of his speed, running the bases well and showing better-than-expected range in center field, where he spent much of his pro debut. He'll need to improve his jumps and routes to stay there, as he at times struggled with reading the ball off the bat in 2018.

It also meant Valera became an international prospect rather than an American high school draftee, and when he was eligible, he signed with Cleveland for $1.3 million.   He is polished for his age, not only in the batter's box but in center field, where he's very comfortable going back on balls. His frame is not especially projectable but Valera's swing has natural lift and he has good feel for contact.

Valera has the best stroke in a system full of pretty swings, displaying looseness, rhythm and balance from the left side of the plate. He also has a mature approach and a knack for drawing walks along with making contact to all fields. His bat speed and the leverage in his swing give him solid raw power, and his skill as a hitter means that he may be able to translate most of it into home-run production once he adds more strength.  Valera has a chance to have average or better tools across the board, though it's still uncertain where he'll play as a finished product.

He didn't hit as much as expected as a senior and some scouts questioned his defensive ability, competitiveness, and feel to hit, so he slipped to the second round despite flashing big power and being 17 on draft day, something that is generally really attractive to analytically-leaning clubs. Vientos performed fine in his pro debut, but broke out in his second year, crushing the Appalachian League at age 18 in 2018. He controlled the strike zone and hit for power while exhibiting very high exit velos for someone his age. Vientos is advanced mechanically, making him a potential 6 bat/6 power combination at maturity if he continues at this trajectory. The competitiveness that some scouts questioned showed up in 2018 when Jarred Kelenic arrived in Kingsport and became the top prospect on the team, and Ronny Mauricio, Luis Santana, and Shervyen Newton were all top 10 prospects in the system in an infield time-share with him. If the makeup has turned a corner and the hitting continues to progress, the main issue will be defensive fit. Vientos is a well below average runner who one scout described as 'athletic from the knees up,' to the point where the lack of quickness will limit him to being average defensively, but he's far from that right now. One Mets source drew a parallel to Nolan Arenado's makeup and defensive concerns, which quickly evaporated in the upper minors as he turned into the best third baseman in baseball, but that seems unlikely at this point.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2017, 2nd (59) - NYM\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  American Heritage (Fla.)

Vientos, who slid a bit after an up-and-down senior season but got an above-pick value of $1.5 million from the Mets to sign, has the chance to eventually join Hosmer as a big league slugging alumni of the school. He flashed his high offensive ceiling in 2018 at Rookie-level Kingsport, where he overcame a slow start to finish among the Appalachian League leaders with 11 home runs (fourth) and 52 RBIs (third).  One of the youngest players in the 2017 Draft class, Vientos has only scraped the surface of his offensive potential. With bat speed and strength, Vientos produces exit velocities that are among the best in the system, up there with the likes of slugger Peter Alonso. That innate ability to impact the baseball gives him a chance to hit for average and power, and the latter is already showing during games. Vientos' timing can get out of whack at times, resulting in some swings and misses, but his approach is advanced for his age, and he's demonstrated a willingness to work deep into counts and take walks.  After playing both spots on the left side of the infield during his debut, Vientos manned the hot corner exclusively at Kingsport in 2018. He has below-average speed and lacks range, but he's athletic and has the requisite hands and plus arm strength needed for the position.

He had a breakout '16-'17 at age 20 and swiped 40 bags while slashing .354/.399/.539. He was seen stateside the following summer during Cuba's tour of the CanAm League, but didn't play well. After he defected, teams' only looks at Mesa were in a workout setting. Cuban prospects have sometimes undergone drastic physical transformations between the point at which theyve last been observed in Cuba and their workouts for teams. Sometimes these changes are positive, as with Luis Robert, who looked like an Ancient Greek sculpture when he worked out for teams in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Sometimes they are not; Yasiel Puigs living conditions made it impossible for him to remain in baseball shape for his eventual workout in Mexico. But this was not the case with Mesa, who retained the sort of physicality he possessed during his last several years in Cuba. He ran a plus-plus 60-yard dash time, threw well, and hit some balls out to his pull side during batting practice. Mesa has a linear, contact-oriented swing that we think will lead to below-average power output in games. He can hit, defend, and add value on the bases, but theres real doubt about the game application of his power. In aggregate, it looks like an average to slightly below-average offensive profile on an above-average defender at a premium position, which amounts to a low-risk, moderate impact prospect who should be ready for the big leagues relatively soon.

Mesa's speed and defense are big-league ready right now. He's a well above-average runner with the savvy to steal bases and he chases down balls from gap to gap in center field. Few players at his position can match his arm strength, which earns double-plus grades from some evaluators.  Scouts are less certain about Mesa's offensive upside. He makes consistent contact, but he doesn't drive the ball much with a relatively flat right-handed swing and he puts the bat on the ball so easily that he doesn't walk much. He could wind up as a faster version of Albert Almora and may not require much time in the Minors.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"A+\"","7","\"2018 J2 (MIA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.1\"","\"54.1\"","\"48.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","30","50","65","50","60","55","45","50","65","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","65","65","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["175","173","281","376","198","\"49.6\"","\"46.7\"","\"45.0\"","\"51.8\"","\"47.9\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","\"Trent\"","\"Thornton\"","2019","\"25.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","180","4","\"|\"","2074","663423","","17948","\"sa857695\"","\"|\"","","\"North Carolina\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","45","\"8jMy6e5UcTs\"","","\"Thornton spent 2018 at Triple-A Fresno before he was effectively showcased in the Arizona Fall League. He has bat-missing, big league stuff, sitting 92-95 and touching 96 in multi-inning Fall League appearances, and sitting comfortably in the 95-96 range when he was asked to air it out for a single inning. Thornton also has elite breaking ball spin rates. His 12-6 curveball spins in excess of 3,000 rpm and his firm, upper-80s slider/cutter often approaches that mark, which is rare for a breaking ball that hard. He also has a unique delivery that disorients hitters, during which his arm wraps behind his lower back. His arm action is ugly but, short of a 7-day DL stint this year after he was hit with a comebacker, Thornton hasnt been hurt as a pro.   His usage has been atypical, however. His starts were often spaced out by seven or eight days in 2018, and its unrealistic to expect him to have that kind of recovery time between turns on a big league pitching staff. If asked to throw every fifth day, his stuff may not be as nasty as it was this year. He projects as a No. 4 or 5 starter but may also be deployed in a multi-inning relief role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"MLB\"","9","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.9\"","\"52.1\"","","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","1.3333","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","3100","40","60","45","55","55","","","45","60","50","60","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["176","174","213","274","287","\"49.6\"","\"47.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.8\"","\"47.9\"","\"51.0\"","\"|\"","\"Keegan\"","\"Akin\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1770","669211","\"akin_keegan\"","","\"sa873980\"","\"|\"","","\"Western Michigan\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","45","\"RKnbSobB0dk\"","","\"The first thing you notice about Akin is his hefty frame. He's listed at 6-foot and 225 pounds, but he's a bit north of that and has come into the last two spring training camps larger than expected. That said, Akin's build isn't seen as a huge problem going forward, as it hasn't impacted his stuff, and most think he just needs to keep it in check a bit. Sources indicated to us that had he not hit his innings limit late in 2018, he would've gotten a big league look in September. The condition of Baltimore's pitching staff is certainly favorable for a soonish Akin debut, and he'll likely open 2019 in Triple-A.   He has above-average big league stuff, especially for a lefty: he sits 92-95 and hits 98 mph, mixing in a solid average slider and a plus changeup. His command ranges from 40 to 60 depending on the start, and Akin's build often leads scouts to believe this is due to his conditioning. We're wary of discounting a player just because he doesn't fit traditional rubrics for success, and baseball is littered with unusual frames and mechanics, but Akin has also had hamstring and oblique issues. The stuff is of the No. 4 to No. 4/5 starter range, but there's also a chance Akin ends up in the bullpen. Again, considering Baltimore's current predicament, we expect him to be developed as a starter for as long as possible. He'll likely be up in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2016, 2nd (54) - BAL\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Akin struck out 133 batters as a Western Michigan junior to establish a single-season record, surpassing former big leaguer Pat Misch on the school's all-time list. The Orioles took him in the second round that June, then assigned him directly to Class A Advanced Frederick for his first full season. Akin pitched to mixed results early before settling in during the second half, and he built upon that success during a breakout Double-A campaign in 2018. He was named Baltimore's Minor League pitcher of the year and garnered similar honors in the Eastern League after he led the circuit in wins (14), strikeouts (142), and batting average against (.225), and posted the third-best ERA (3.27).  Akin's repeatable delivery and clean arm action allow him to paint both sides of the plate with a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and touches 95. An above-average slider in the low 80s is Akin's best secondary pitch, and he also demonstrates feel for a changeup that's at least average. He throws each of his three pitches for strikes and is comfortable pitching inside against right-handed hitters with his fastball. While he doesn't generate many ground balls and at times is prone to the long ball, Akin does induce a healthy number of whiffs and induces weak contact by effectively changing speeds.  The Orioles changed Akin's heel placement on the rubber back in 2017, and that adjustment has helped him stay on line to the plate and better execute his pitches. He still has gains to make both with his control and command, but all the ingredients are there for Akin to serve as a No. 4 starter, perhaps more, if he continues down his current developmental path.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AAA\"","8","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"52.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2450","45","55","55","","45","","","50","55","60","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","55","","","","50","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["177","175","280","272","495","\"49.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.4\"","\"38.2\"","\"50.4\"","\"|\"","\"Nasim\"","\"Nunez\"","2019","\"18.8\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"69\"","\"165\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2854","","\"nunez_nasim\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Collins Hill HS (GA)\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2023","45","","\"Elite defensive shortstop, slight of build, power is the only weakness.\"","\"Nunez stood out all summer for his contact skills, plus speed, and glove and arm strength, then took a step forward this spring when he added some strength to his frame.

The only question is whether Nunez will make it there because he might be the best defensive shortstop in the 2019 Draft. If he convinces pro teams he can produce at the plate, they probably won't let him make it to college.  A fast-twitch athlete, Nunez has Gold Glove upside at shortstop and is a slam dunk to stay at the position. He has smooth actions, quick hands and feet and the arm to make any throw from any angle. In the event that he doesn't hit enough to be an everyday player in the big leagues, he has the tools to play anywhere on the diamond in a utility role.  Because Nunez is one of the smallest premium prospects in the Draft at 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds, he comes with concerns about how much impact he'll have at the plate.

That alone is enough to go on the first day if the health checks out, which Espino's does. The neutral aspect is that he's a maxed-out 6-foot-2, 200 pounds. The negative aspect is a very long arm stroke and as you might guess, a power approach rather than fine command. No prep prospect can be everything as an 18-year-old but Espino's velocity was 95-98, touching 100 this spring in early starts with lots of rest and was more 92-96 touching 97 when on normal rest. Pitchers lose velocity as they age, so many teams prefer a more conventional delivery and arm stroke, and a pitcher with average stuff and good feel who can grow into power stuff, rather than a power pitcher who has to learn feel only when his stuff declines. The recent track record of prep pitchers who hit 98-100 before the draft is riddled with injuries and command regression. With prep pitching being so subject to specific team tastes to try to avoid busts and attrition, many teams are out on Espino on Day 1 and others, particularly the more progressive clubs that value velo, spin rate, high octane stuff in shorter stints, and area control with that stuff, are interested in the 20s and 30s.\"","\"|\"","\"Georgia Premier Academy\"","","","","","50","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-daniel-espino-rhp-c2520532183?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    Born in Panama, Espino moved to the United States for his sophomore year of high school in 2016. Since arriving with a mid-80s fastball, he has developed into the hardest thrower in the '19 prep class. He repeatedly reached the upper 90s on the showcase circuit last summer and broke Hunter Greene's Under Armour All-America Game record with a fastball clocked at 99 mph.     Espino usually works at 94-97 mph and has reached triple digits with his fastball. He can overpower hitters with sheer velocity, gets good riding action on his four-seamer and can show heavy sink on a two-seamer. Opponents can't afford to sit on his heater because he has a pair of power breaking pitches, with his sharp low-80s slider currently grading better than his upper-70s curveball with good depth.    Espino dabbles with a changeup that gets too firm but flashes good sink at times. The Louisiana State recruit's control and command are inconsistent, in part because he has a long arm action, so some scouts project him more as a reliever than as a starter. There's not a lot of projection remaining in his frame, which is smaller than his listed height and weight, but his present stuff already is plenty good.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CLE\"","","9","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (CLE)\"","\"|\"","33","24","\"CLE\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"53.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","1.5000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","65","40","50","55","","","50","65","45","55","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","50","55","60","","","","50","","",""],["179","177","173","174","464","\"49.5\"","\"48.5\"","\"47.9\"","\"49.6\"","\"49.6\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Tony\"","\"Gonsolin\"","2019","\"25.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","278","6","\"|\"","2361","664062","","","\"sa918175\"","\"|\"","","\"St. Mary's\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2019","47","\"5Up3xEVGF-I\"","\" \"","\"A two-way college player, Gonsolin was a ninth round senior sign whose velocity spiked in pro ball when he focused on pitching, moved to the bullpen (he has since moved back into the rotation, after he was yo-yo'd back and forth in college), and was touched by the Dodgers excellent player dev group. At times his fastball has been in the upper-90s, cresting 100, but it was in the low-90s this spring and he was placed on he injured list thereafter with an oblique issue.   Gonsolin's four-pitch mix looks like it was designed in a lab and considering the way his stuff works together, it may have been. He's an extreme overhand, backspinning four-seam guy, and he works up at the letters with it. It's complemented by a deep-diving, 12-6 curveball. He'll also work a slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors. It's a non-traditional style of pitching for a starter, so some eyeball scouts think he ends up in the bullpen. If so, it's probably in a valuable multi-inning role.

Though the Dodgers liked his tools as an outfielder, they preferred him as a pitcher and have seen him consistently improve since he moved full-time to the mound after signing for $2,500 as a ninth-rounder in 2016. His stuff took off in his first full season as a pro and continued to impress after he shifted from the bullpen to the rotation in 2018, when he topped the system in wins (10), ERA (2.60) and strikeouts (155 in 128 innings).  Gonsolin began 2017 with an 88-92 mph fastball but was hitting 100 by the end of that season, and he operated at 93-97 mph as a starter in '18 while maintaining his velocity into the late innings. His upper-80s splitter devastates hitters with the way it dives at the plate, and his low-80s curveball has become a consistent plus offering with nice shape. He also uses a mid-80s slider to give hitters a different look.  The athleticism that helped Gonsolin thrive as a two-way player in college also allows him to throw strikes on a regular basis. He still needs to refine his command, and Los Angeles would like to see him work inside and up in the zone more with his fastball. He has progressed from senior sign to potential No. 3 starter rapidly, and he could be a multi-inning relief weapon this year for a Dodgers club loaded with starters.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAD\"","\"AAA\"","6","\"2016 Draft Rnd 9 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"49.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2700","45","60","","50","45","","55","45","60","","50","45","","55","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","","60","50","","70","","50","","",""],["180","178","169","175","326","\"49.5\"","\"48.6\"","\"47.9\"","\"50.5\"","\"47.3\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Adam\"","\"Haseley\"","2019","\"23.1\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","278","6","\"|\"","871","656514","\"haseley_adam\"","19878","\"sa915818\"","\"|\"","","\"Virginia\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","47","\"4VTSjkcv6tA\"","","\"Haseley was an intriguing two-way talent with a big price tag and decent tools out of an Orlando-area high school. In college, stood out playing both ways for the Cavaliers, emerging in his draft year as an elite hitter. He'd still pitched his whole career, so some scouts saw further offensive potential beyond Haseley's dominating draft year due to an exclusive pro focus on hitting, excellent exit velocities, and a quirky, flat-planed swing that could be streamlined in pro ball. He's made some subtle changes to his swing but he's still mostly the same player he was in his draft year at Virginia. Haseley is fringy to average for most scouts in center field. His pitcher arm strength doesn't translate to the outfield, but he would be an above average left fielder if he can't stick in center. Like a few hitters in this system, a loft or approach change could shift the offensive profile a bit for Haseley, but he seems capable of a roughly 100 wRC+ (read: major league average at the plate), which is a solid regular if he can be average in center field.

An above-average runner, the Phillies feel he can stay in center long term and be better than average there, though he saw time at all three outfield spots in 2018.  The Phillies feel Haseley's first year was a bit under-appreciated and are excited to see how he can build off of his successful opening season.

He was one of the best performing amateur hitters from Venezuela in his signing class (just ahead of Everson Pereira, who's further down this list), and he was also a plus runner who could've been converted to catcher given his quickness, arm strength, and squatty, powerful frame. But the Yankees didn't want to slow down his bat by asking him to learn to catch. Some scouts who had a one or two game look at this summer didn't love Cabello's non-projectable frame, and they rounded down if he didn't hit in those short looks. But those who saw him for more than a few games saw the advanced bat amateur scouts saw.   One enthusiastic scout described Cabello's running as plus, though he's not the typically graceful, long striding plus runner. That scout he said had a 'grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat.' In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength and raw power, and now the start of a strong statistical performance record. And if things go askew at the plate, the notion that Cabello could catch is interesting. One Yankee source described Cabello as an 80 makeup guy, often a prerequisite to consider sending a player behind the plate He's a well-rounded offensive player who looks like an up-the-middle defensive fit of some kind.

His bat speed and strength also give him plenty of raw power, which translated into him topping the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with a .555 slugging percentage. He should develop even more pop as he adds more loft to his right-handed swing.  Cabello's speed earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators, a major factor in the Yankees' decision to move him from behind the plate.

Pardinho grew up in Brazil, which has a large Japanese population, and he has some Japanese heritage; his windup clearly points to a Japanese influence.   The issue here is that Pardinho is listed at 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, and isn't much bigger than that right now, though he has a sturdy build. 18-year-old pitchers need to have big velocity, or projection to add velocity, to be top prospects since they generally start losing velocity in their mid-20s; that innate velocity, or projection for it, offers some margin for error. There are exceptions to this benchmark, like Zack Greinke, cases where a pitcher has been a pitchability type with above average stuff from his teenage days all the way into a big league career, but those instances are very rare. Pardinho will sit 92-95 and hit 96 mph early in outing and settle around 90-93 later. His curveball flashed above average as an amateur and he mixed in a slider that lagged behind, but those two pitches are both average to above now. They're different pitches but still can run together at times, common for a younger pitcher. Parindho's changeup is his fourth pitch now and it's around average, but he separated himself with above average command projection, which helped him post gaudy numbers in his pro debut in the Appalachian League at 17.   Pardinho is undoubtedly advanced and projects as a No. 3 or 4 starter if things go well, but he was essentially pitching like a college senior in a league where a college senior can dominate and then never get to Double-A. Pardinho is a prospect because he's advanced enough to pitch like a 22-year-old when he's 17 years old. We'd just like to see either his stuff improve -- or hold that velocity for the whole game -- or see performance against more advanced hitters before we shoot him up the list like he's the next Greinke.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - TOR\"","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  Pardinho ranked as MLB Pipeline's No. 5 prospect for the 2017-18 international period after an impressive amateur career in Brazil before signing with Toronto for $1.4 million. The Blue Jays deemed him advanced enough to make the jump straight to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his pro debut, and Pardinho, just 17, rewarded the club's confidence by posting a 2.88 ERA over 50 innings and finishing third in the circuit in strikeouts (64).   Pardinho's stuff and feel for pitching is exceptional for his age. His velocity has ticked up since signing, giving him a low 90s fastball with late life that can touch 96 mph. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball, his best secondary pitch, and he added a slider in 2018 that already has the makings of becoming at least average. The same can be said about Pardinho's promising changeup, also a relatively new pitch for him.  Perhaps what's most impressive about Pardinho is his ability execute his pitches as part of an overall game plan. His arm action and delivery are clean and repeatable, and he effectively compensates for being somewhat undersized by getting good extension over his front side. He still has quite a bit of development remaining, but all the ingredients are there for Pardinho to develop into a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"A\"","8","\"2017 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.4\"","\"53.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2100","45","50","45","50","45","","","55","55","50","55","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","60","50","","","","55","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["183","181","325","425","363","\"49.4\"","\"46.1\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.2\"","\"45.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Noah\"","\"Song\"","2019","\"22.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"200\"","\"draft\"","339","8","\"|\"","2506","","\"song_noah\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Navy\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2021","42","","\"A Naval commitment clouds his future.

The right-hander is having an extraordinary senior year and belongs in top-three-round consideration based on his talent, but it should be noted that it took Harris and Drake nearly seven years to make it all the way to the Majors.  Song has a legitimate starting pitcher profile coming from a 6-foot-4 frame. He'll get his fastball consistently up to 96 mph and maintains that velocity throughout his starts, with the only drawback being that it can be a little straight at times. He gets a lot of swings and misses with his above-average slider and some feel that his curveball could be good enough to do the same if he were to throw it more. He can mix in a solid changeup as well and has done a much better job throwing strikes this year. He does have a little bit of an inverted elbow in the back of his delivery, which might cause some of the inconsistencies with his curve, but overall has not kept him from being very effective.  The big question mark is about Song's required two-year military service before he potentially could join a Major League organization and the current policy is to not let potential professional athletes forego that requirement (the Air Force's Griffin Jax was able to join the Twins before that rule was changed). So any team interested in Song's considerable upside will be rolling the dice.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","","11","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","49","137","\"BOS\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"52.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.5000","","","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","55","40","50","50","","","50","60","45","55","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","45","55","","","","50","","",""],["184","182","201","270","214","\"49.4\"","\"47.8\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.5\"","\"45.8\"","\"52.0\"","\"|\"","\"Lenny\"","\"Torres Jr.,Torres\"","2019","\"18.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2425","678013","\"torres_jr_lineras\"","","\"sa3008329\"","\"|\"","","\"Beacon HS (NY)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","45","\"oQt2oGijG8Q\"","","\"Torres checked a lot of amateur scouting boxes -- the body, athleticism, stuff, and makeup were all lauded -- and was a model-friendly prospect due to his age, so while issues with fastball command caused some clubs to project him in relief, he was still a clear top two round talent. Perhaps Torres' control is behind because, as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in New York couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, Torres had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on.   Perhaps the most striking aspect of Torres' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side.

He continued to bring the heat last spring and worked his way into the supplemental first round, where he signed for a below-slot $1.35 million. He surprised the Indians by proving to be more advanced than they expected during his brief pro debut, especially considering he was one of the youngest players in the 2018 Draft.  With a lightning-quick arm, Torres effortlessly works at 92-95 mph and touches 98 with riding life on his fastball. His low-80s slider has the makings of a plus pitch with power and high spin rates.

He was leading the short-season New York-Penn League in whiff rate (11.4) last summer before he was promoted to low Class A at age 19 in August.  Oviedo's projectability appealed to Cleveland and he already has started to deliver on it, with his fastball increasing from the upper 80s when he signed to the mid 90s with a peak of 98 mph and quality sink in 2018. His advanced changeup is his best secondary offering and could develop into a second plus pitch. The Indians have encouraged him to throw his curveball more often and he also has a harder slider, both of which are solid at their best.  Unlike a lot of young, tall pitchers, Oviedo has little difficulty repeating his delivery. He throws consistent strikes from a three-quarters arm slot that creates angle and movement.

He developed into the Sox's highest-floor pitching prospect before missing the final two months of the 2018 season with a strained elbow and undergoing Tommy John surgery this March.  Dunning has three different pitches that grade as plus at their best. He doesn't light up radar guns with a low-90s fastball that peaks at 96 mph, but it's a weapon because its heavy sink makes it hard to lift and he commands it so well to both sides of the plate. Some evaluators believe his curveball has surpassed his slider as his better breaking ball, and both offerings have plenty of depth and enough power.    Dunning's changeup gives him a fourth pitch that should be at least solid, though it's not quite as consistent as his others.

He played at a high profile Atlanta-area high school (the same one as his brother Josh, who the Rays drafted in first round in 2016), played sparingly for a year at Mercer, then transferred to St. John's River junior college in Jacksonville, FL, where he hit 17 homers, a feat that got him to Mississippi State for his junior season. He had a solid season for the Bulldogs but was a first base-only prospect with no pedigree who hit five home runs, so you can see why he lasted until the 13th round in the 2016 draft.  His hitability translated well that first pro summer and in 2017, which he split across both A-Ball levels at ages 21 and 22. The missing element here is that while Lowe had plus raw power the first time we saw him at Mississippi State, he didn't have the kind of swing or approach to get the most out of it. This untapped tool and his plate discipline are the reasons he was a 13th rounder and not a 35th rounder who went back to school for his senior year. In 2018, Lowe did a rare thing: he tried to do more damage at the plate and lift the ball a bit more, but was able to keep his contact rates the same while adding game power. Miguel Andujar did this in the Yankees farm system two years in a row and went from an untapped, toolsy prospect who was passed over in the Rule 5 Draft to a Rookie of the Year runner-up; Lowe went from the top of the 'Others of Note' section last year to one of the top 150 prospects in the game over a 12 month period. Lowe is a fine defender at first but the value here is all in the bat. Because he's left-handed, the downside is a platoon option at 1B/DH, though the Rays cycle through those types very quickly. Underlying indicators and TrackMan data suggest Lowe's very loud 2018 stats aren't fluky and he may just be a 50 bat with advanced feel for the zone and 60 game power, which is a solid regular. He might be big league ready in the middle of 2019.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2016, 13th (390) - TB\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 35 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 50  The Lowe household was well represented in the 2016 Draft, with brothers Josh and Nate both going to the Rays. But while Josh may have been the more highly touted prospect and a first-round pick, it's been Nate, a 13th-round pick out of Mississippi State, who has had the better pro career. He followed a nondescript first full season with an absolutely massive breakout campaign in 2018, hitting .330/.416/.568 with 27 homers, 32 doubles and 102 RBIs as he ascended from Class A Advanced Charlotte to Triple-A Durham, earning a Futures Game selection along the way.  Behind improved bat speed and a looser, more athletic swing, Lowe showed that he could drive the ball over the fence to the biggest part of any park while still exhibiting a discerning eye at the plate. After profiling as more of a hit-over-power guy early in his career, the hulking left-handed hitter has learned how to tap into his plus-plus raw power and turn on the ball with consistency without it detracting from his impressive feel to hit and overall strong approach that nets him walks and fuels his on-base skills. Lowe's well-below-average speed limits him to first base, though he's a solid defender and makes all the routine plays.  Lowe's newfound power and dependable left-handed bat could go a long way in helping him become an everyday first baseman in the big leagues. A platoon role remains a possibility, although Lowe's improvement against same-sided pitching in 2018 suggests that he might be able to avoid such relegation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AAA\"","11","\"2016 Draft Rnd 13 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"50.9\"","\"55.0\"","\"48.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","50","65","40","45","50","55","60","65","35","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","35","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["188","186","230","171","679","\"49.3\"","\"47.4\"","\"47.9\"","\"48.4\"","\"37.8\"","\"49.4\"","\"|\"","\"Brice\"","\"Turang\"","2019","\"19.5\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"173\"","\"professional\"","278","6","\"|\"","2404","668930","\"turang_brice\"","","\"sa3008294\"","\"|\"","","\"Santiago HS (CA)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","47","\"ndJStZbwH1c\"","","\"Even as an underclassman playing alongside rising seniors like Nick Allen, Hunter Greene, Nick Pratto and Royce Lewis, Turang did not look out of place. In addition to his a balletic defensive abilities, he was also a polished hitter who had advanced strike-zone feel. Turang struck out just once as a high scool junior and entered his final showcase summer at the top of his high school draft class. Then, he stopped hitting. After looking sluggish during the summer and fall, Turang's placement among the first round candidates changed. He fell to the back half of the first round and signed for $3.4 million, roughly $400,000 over slot. After signing, Turang looked so much more advanced than the rest of the AZL that he was pushed, after just two weeks, to the Pioneer League. Throughout the summer and fall, he ran deep counts and walked a lot, but made little impact contact. He's shown average raw power in BP, so perhaps he'll eventually have the developmental option of sacrificing contact to get to it. As long as some aspect of his offense develops, especially as it seems likely to be paired with a great idea of the strike zone and plus shortstop defense, Turang should be an above-average regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2018, 1st (21) - MIL\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The Brewers didn't expect Turang to still be on the board when they made their first pick well into the first round of the 2018 Draft. But after a senior year during which evaluators had soured on him a bit, even though he previously was viewed as one of the top prep players in the country, Turang was still available for Milwaukee with the No. 21 overall pick. Despite concerns about his signability as an LSU commit, the Brewers were able to ink Turang for $3,411,100 during the week before the signing deadline. He rewarded the club for their risk by reaching the Pioneer League during an impressive pro debut.   Turang does everything fairly well and could have four average-or-better tools once he's fully developed. He has the chance to be a plus hitter with an advanced approach at the plate, using a high-contact, line-drive spray approach. With a lean frame, there is some question about how much strength he'll add, and whether he'll offer anything more than below-average game power. Turang's plus speed is his strongest tool, and he isn't shy about putting it to use on the basepaths. He has the athleticism, hands and arm strength needed to stick as a shortstop.   The son of former big league outfielder Brian Turang, Brice is more advanced and polished than the typical high school pick and could move through the Minors relatively faster than his peers.

He creates havoc when he gets on base and is doing a better job of doing so in 2019, making more consistent contact while posting one of the higher walk rates in NCAA Division I. A switch-hitter with some bat speed and strength, he shows average raw power from both sides of the plate during batting practice but has yet to translate it into home run production.

During collegiate scrimmages in the fall of 2017, scouts saw a big, athletic second baseman who was just okay defensively, had an all-fields, line drive approach without much pop, and plus to plus-plus speed. Duran had a fine junior spring, but hit for almost no power (which perhaps should be expected in a pitcher-friendly home stadium like Blair Field in Long Beach) and slipped to the seventh round as a nearly-22-year-old with a modest statistical track record. After signing, the Red Sox had Duran change his swing a bit in BP to see if they could tap into something more, and the 6-foot-2, 200-pound Duran started showing above-average pull power. Boston also moved him to center field, where his long-range speed fits better than it did on the infield. He crushed short season and Low-A after signing. For Long Beach State, Duran had 13 extra base hits in 253 PA in 2018; across two pro levels, he had 28 extra base hits in 302 PA, including 11 triples. There are multiple examples of hitters, including Matt Chapman and several of the Stanford guys, who had breakouts after leaving overly-traditional west coast college hitting programs. Duran may be the most recent.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","\"2018, 7th (220) - BOS\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 70 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Duran's plus-plus speed led the Red Sox to sign him for $189,000 as a seventh-rounder in the 2018 Draft. They weren't expecting much power after he had slugged .377 in three years at Long Beach State, so his .357/.394/.516 debut was a pleasant surprise. He quickly established himself as the fastest player and top outfield prospect in the system.  Duran has a left-handed stroke geared for line-drive contact and his quickness can make routine ground balls a challenge for the defense. While he won't be a slugger, he has the ability to backspin the ball from gap to gap and drove the ball more consistently once he stopped spreading out in his stance like he did in college. He's still honing his basestealing acumen, but he has the speed to be a force on the bases.  A second baseman for the 49ers, Duran spent his first month in pro ball at the keystone before shifting to the outfield. He needs to improve his reads and jumps but is fast enough to outrun a lot of his mistakes and should become a solid center fielder once he gains more experience. He has fringy arm strength but it isn't a liability because he gets to balls quicker than most outfielders.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"AA\"","2","\"2018 Draft Rnd 7 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"51.8\"","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","35","30","55","70","40","40","50","45","55","70","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","70","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["191","189","108","101","196","\"49.2\"","\"50.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"51.8\"","\"46.9\"","\"52.3\"","\"|\"","\"Josh\"","\"Naylor\"","2019","\"21.9\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"71\"","\"250\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1288","647304","\"naylor_josh\"","18839","\"sa874243\"","\"|\"","112","\"St. Joan of Arc HS (CAN)\"","-2","1","","\"High\"","2020","50","\"N59Wtnb9Eyw\"","\"Naylor is a husky slugger with a 55 hit tool, 70 raw power, and a strong Double-A campaign behind him.

It's because of a sterling performance in his draft spring facing professional pitchers in spring training stadiums that clubs became confident he had a 50 or better bat to go with his easy plus raw power; the Marlins surprised many by taking him in the middle of the first round. His speed, defense, position, and thick frame have always been below average, but luckily Naylor's bat has carried him this far and it appears it will carry him to a big league career of some consequence.   Miami traded Naylor to San Diego in the controversial Colin Rea deal, soon after also trading Chris Paddack to the Padres in a separate transaction. Naylor was involved in a bizarre accidental stabbing with teammate Stone Garrett just before the trade. San Diego has Eric Hosmer in his way, so you'd need to see a trade or the universal DH for Naylor to have a path to playing with his left field defense grading well below average.

He impressed in his full-season debut the following year, but Miami suspended Naylor in June after he was the perpetrator of a knife \"prank gone wrong\" that resulted in teammate Stone Garrett needing thumb surgery. That July, the Marlins dealt Naylor to the Padres in a deal headlined by Andrew Cashner. After earning a second Futures Game selection in 2017, Naylor reached Double-A later that season. He returned in '18, and he thrived, showcasing some of the best on-base skills in the organization.  At the start, many believed Naylor would be able to ride his left-handed raw power, but he has stood out more for his savvy hitting ability early in his career. The Ontario native makes hard contact to all fields thanks to his plus bat speed and excellent hand-eye coordination. Both his strikeout and walk rates have been moving in positive directions, though he can become passive at the plate on occasion. Perhaps as a result, it took some time for Naylor to tap into his power. But he launched 17 homers in Double-A last season.  Naylor isn't tall, and he's stocky, though he shed about 20 pounds prior to the 2019 season. He's nonetheless a good athlete for his size. He'd made some strides at first base, when the Padres moved him to the left field -- where he's clearly a work in progress. Naylor's range and his instincts in the outfield look like those of someone who's only just learning the position. Defensive concerns aside, Padres officials are high on Naylor's potential at the plate. He'll need to continue to tap into his power to make his corner profile work at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"MLB\"","8","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (MIA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"53.6\"","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","45","70","20","40","55","55","60","70","20","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","40","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["192","190","236","266","463","\"49.1\"","\"47.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.6\"","\"45.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"McKenna\"","2019","\"22.3\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1324","663630","\"mckenna_ryan\"","","\"sa875055\"","\"|\"","","\"St. Thomas Aquinas HS (NH)\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","45","\"u90vH-3V-x0\"","","\"McKenna's 2018 Arizona Fall League showing took those who had seen him during the spring and summer a bit by surprise. Even as he was hitting a raucous and unsustainable .377/.467/.556 at Hi-A Frederick, McKenna dealt with a myriad of lower body ailments that clouded his speed and defensive abilities in center field. In the autumn though, he was posting 70 and 80-grade run times to first base, and his range is center field is perhaps the best Baltimore will have seen since Ed Reed. Offensively, McKenna's abilities fall somewhere between that incredible first half and his lousy late-summer showing at Double-A Bowie. He doesn't have much raw power but he may hit an awful lot of doubles by slashing balls down each baseline, and by turning dribbling gap liners into hustle doubles. Big league pitching may eventually find locations to attack McKenna that prevent him from getting to his brand of power -- he struggled to do anything with pitches down and in during Fall League, for instance -- and if that's true, he may end up as a fourth outfielder, but we tenatively have him projected as a low-end regular in center field.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2015, 4th (133) - BAL\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  A product of the New Hampshire prep ranks, McKenna was committed to Liberty before the Orioles drafted him in the fourth round and signed him for slot value. He showed well in his first full season, tallying 42 extra-base hits and 20 steals at Class A Delmarva, and then broke out in earnest in 2018 with a torrid first half in the Class A Advanced Carolina League (.377/.467/.556) before a bump up to Double-A in June. While he didn't fare as well in the Eastern League (.239/.341/.338), McKenna did get back on track in the Arizona Fall League, finishing fifth in the batting race (.344) and second in OPS (1.064).  McKenna's quick bat and natural feel for finding the barrel helps him make consistent line-drive contact, and he's become increasingly comfortable hitting to all fields as he's faced better pitching. He's also made strides in refining his approach, demonstrating a combination of patience and aggressiveness that fuels his ability to both hit for average and get on base at a solid clip. While McKenna projects for more gap power than true over-the-fence pop, some evaluators believe he could have seasons with double-digit homers in his prime.  McKenna gets out of the box exceptionally well for a right-handed hitter and routinely posts plus-or-better home-to-first run times. That speed also gives him the chance to stay in center field, and he has more than enough arm strength for the position. Overall, McKenna has the ceiling of a center fielder who hits at either the top or bottom of the lineup, and his well-rounded game gives him a realistic fourth-outfielder floor.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","10","\"2015 Draft Rnd 4 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"50.9\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","30","45","70","55","50","50","40","45","70","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","40","60","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["193","191","180","267","93","\"49.1\"","\"48.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"53.2\"","\"45.4\"","\"53.9\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Busch\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"207\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2832","","\"busch_michael\"","","","\"|\"","","\"North Carolina\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2021","45","","\"Stiff but well-built, power-hitting corner outfielder.\"","\"More athletic than is typical for a first base/corner outfield prospect, Busch has several years of strong statistical performance at UNC and is a high-effort player.

So judicious is Rengifo's eye for the plate that if he were cloned 15 times and each clone forced to be an umpire, there might be a lot less talk of electronic strike zones. He identifies balls and strikes early in flight and often relaxes before balls have even entered the catcher's mitt. There's a chance that Rengifo's lack of power (he has more from the right side) limits the way his eye for the zone plays in the big leagues, since pitchers will be more likely to attack him without fear of him doing damage on his own. Most of his doubles come by slashing balls down either baseline, or when he turns gappers into extra bases because of his speed. We think there's enough bat to retain most of the on-base ability Rengifo has shown so far and that, combined with his multi-positional versatility, could yield super-utility value.   Though he spent all of last year playing either second base or shortstop, Rengifo also has experience in both outfield corners and at third base. The Angels added Rengifo to the 40-man this offseason and while they're well-stocked on the infield (Simmons, La Stella, Fletcher, Cozart), they're rather thin in the outfield, and very right-handed. As such, Rengifo's first opportunity could come as an injury replacement out there, or he may fall into a Chone Figginsy utility role.

Rengifo has always shown a knack for making consistent contact from both sides of the plate using a short and compact swing geared for line drives. While he's never going to be a huge power guy, he did show more extra-base pop in 2018. He's never been prone to striking out, and he combined that with a big increase in his walk rate, making him an even better all-around hitter. While he's not a burner, he's a smart baserunner, allowing him to lead the organization in steals a year ago.    Over the course of his career, Rengifo has played a number of positions -- he played on both sides of second in his first year with the Angels organization and has the defensive attributes to handle both spots.

Throughout the summer, scouts realized that he was a clear top five round talent on the mound, but a truly elite prospect at the plate. Lowe flashed plus speed, a plus arm, and plus raw power from the left side, projecting as the rare big center fielder with hit and power tools. The concern was that Lowe's uphill, aggressive, power-oriented cut would limit his contact rate; after the Rays took him in the first round, his swing plane was flatter. In 2018, Lowe's older brother and fellow Rays farmhand, Nate, shockingly went from fringe prospect to passing his more famous sibling in prospect status. Josh hasn't put the loft back in his game swing, so he doesn't look much different than the No. 1 overall pick from his draft class, Phillies center fielder Mickey Moniak. Both posted solid, contact-oriented offensive seasons in the Florida State League at age 20 while playing a solid center field. The difference is that Lowe has plus raw power he could tap back into, while Moniak may eventually grow into just average raw power. Lowe is ticketed for Double-A in 2019 and has a very laid back demeanor, which can turn off some scouts, though others see it as a sign he can handle the grind of the game and break through like his older brother did last year.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2016, 1st (13) - TB\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 45 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  A two-way standout in high school, Lowe garnered Georgia Gatorade player of the year honors as a senior and was one of the more impressive all-around athletes available in the 2016 Draft. The Rays liked him more as a hitter and selected him with the 13th overall pick, then lured him away from a Florida State commitment with a $2.6 million bonus. He overcame a sluggish start in his full-season debut the next year and ultimately finished on a high note, hitting .296/.350/.415 with 24 extra-base hits and 14 steals over his final 72 games. The performance led to high expectations for Lowe's 2018 campaign, though he was unable to build upon that progress in the Florida State League, where his feel to hit backed up and resulted in below-average production.   Lowe's athleticism and physical tools suggest he'll eventually make an impact at the plate, but right now he's still figuring out what type of hitter he is. He knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone and has added some loft since signing, though, so far, it hasn't yet translated to any uptick in usable power. But even as he's scuffled at the plate, Lowe has worked to improve his approach and become more selective. That progress was evident in 2018, as he trimmed his strikeout rate by nearly 3 percent from the previous year while simultaneously improving his walk rate from 8.3 to 10.3 percent. It gives him a solid foundation for further offensive development, and club officials are still bullish about Lowe's potential to hit for average and power.   After struggling at third base during his pro debut, Lowe was shifted to center field and immediately proved a natural, covering huge amounts of ground with his plus speed and long, graceful strides. He's developed into the best defensive outfielder in the system and looks like a lock to stick in center field, where his offensive profile offers the most value.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AA\"","12","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"51.8\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","60","45","60","50","45","60","60","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","45","60","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"NYM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["197","195","229","534","20","\"49.0\"","\"47.4\"","\"42.9\"","\"56.2\"","\"52.8\"","\"56.5\"","\"|\"","\"Colin\"","\"Poche\"","2019","\"25.4\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"235\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","3031","621363","","19403","\"sa657989\"","\"|\"","","\"Dallas Baptist\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","42","","","\"It's pretty common for pitchers to have a delivery that accentuates their stuff, and often, it's easy to detect with the naked eye. This is not so for Poche, whose mechanical sleight of hand is not visually obvious, but whose success with what appears to be a mediocre fastball is unmatched in the minors. Poche has somehow managed to generate elite swinging strike rates with fringe fastball velocity and a spin rate that's shy of average. Scouts and <a href='https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-most-unhittable-arm-in-the-minors/'>colleagues</a> have asserted that Poche hides the ball well, only showing it to hitters when it suddenly appears out from behind his head. Poche also generates elite down-mound extension and fastball rise. His pitches not only make hitters look uncomfortable, they sometimes sneak up on the catcher, too. Essentially, Poche has an average fastball with three separate characteristics that make it play up. Big league hitters may be less vulnerable to one or more of these characteristics, but if not, Poche's fastball is going to play like a 7 or 8, and he could be a top 50 big league reliever.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2016, 14th (419) - ARI\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  A 14th-round Draft selection by the D-backs out of Dallas Baptist in 2016, Poche was dealt to the Rays in May 2018 as the PTBNL from the offseason Steven Souza trade. He was already having a breakout campaign when the Rays acquired him, and that only continued after the trade. The best reliever in the Minors in 2018, Poche recorded a 0.82 ERA, 0.79 WHIP and .151 BAA in 66 innings (40 appearances) between Double-A and Triple-A. What's more, the left-hander racked up 110 strikeouts (against 19 walks), fanned 45.6 percent of his batters faced and averaged 15.0 strikeouts-per-nine. No Minor League pitcher with as many innings recorded a better strikeout rate in 2018 than Poche.   The left-hander racks up most of his whiffs with a fastball that sits at 92-94 mph on the radar gun but plays at a much, much higher effective velocity thanks to a high spin rate and because Poche's delivery and arm action are both highly deceptive. He hides the ball extremely well and gets considerable extension over his front side, leaving hitters with little time to pick up the ball out of his hand. Poche also throws an above-average slider with late, horizontal action, and both offerings play up because he commands them well.   Poche may not have prototypical late-inning stuff, but it's not going to keep him from emerging as a bullpen force at the highest level. His ability to miss bats and generate weak contact against hitters on both sides of the plate is elite, and those traits, as well as his ability to cover multiple innings, give him huge upside as a fireman reliever.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"MLB\"","25","\"2016 Draft Rnd 14 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"53.0\"","\"58.0\"","\"52.0\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2500","50","65","","","50","","","55","70","","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","","","55","","","","55","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["198","196","211","264","306","\"49.0\"","\"47.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"47.2\"","\"51.0\"","\"|\"","\"Dean\"","\"Kremer\"","2019","\"23.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","3071","665152","","","\"sa876350\"","\"|\"","","\"UNLV\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","45","","","\"Some international evaluators had a longer history of seeing Kremer than area scouts did, as Kremer spent his freshman and draft-eligible sophomore seasons at two different schools, but he's been pitching for Israel's national team since 2014. A dual citizen, Kremer was the first ever Israeli to have his name called during baseball's draft. His stuff drastically improved once he began to be nurtured by the Dodgers' player development machine, and Kremer K'd more hitters over 131 innings of work in 2018 than he did during his entire college career. His fastball has middling velocity but it's lively, and Kremer's arm slot is tough on righties. Both of his secondaries are capable of missing bats and while Kremer lacks pinpoint command, he throws enough strikes to start. Before he was part of the Manny Machado trade, Kremer projected as a No. 4 or 5 starter or multi-inning reliever. We think he's best suited for the latter role, but given the rebuilding nature of the Orioles, he'll likely begin his big league career as a starter.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2016, 14th (431) - LA\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Undrafted out of high school, Kremer attended San Joaquin Delta (Calif.) JC and became the first Israeli citizen to be selected in the MLB Draft when the Padres took him in the 38th round in 2015. The next year, after a transfer to Nevada-Las Vegas, Kremer became the first to sign with an MLB organization when the Dodgers paid him $147,500 as a 14th-rounder. Kremer struggled as a swingman in the California League in his first full season but returned to the level in 2018 and dominated as a starter. The performance netted Kremer his first Double-A promotion in early July, though he would make only one Texas League start (a seven-inning, 11-strikeout gem) before heading to the Orioles as one of five prospects dealt by the Dodgers to get Manny Machado. He was excellent in eight starts for Double-A Bowie after the trade to finish his breakout campaign with a 2.88 ERA and a Minor League-best 178 strikeouts.  The Dodgers had Kremer focus on throwing his curveball more in 2018, and it quickly became his best weapon. It's a plus pitch with big break that nets him whiffs both inside and out of the zone, one he's comfortable throwing it in any count. Kremer's fastball is lively, as he'll operate at 91-95 mph and touch 96, with late, arm-side run. He fills out his four-pitch mix with a slider that flashes above-average potential and a fringy changeup that requires further development. He throws strikes with his entire arsenal and has the ability to retire hitters on both sides of the plate.  Kremer didn't start pitching full-time until he got to junior college and was young for his draft class, so there's reason to believe he has even more room to develop. He looks like a future No. 4 starter given his current profile, though improvements to his slider and changeup could push him higher up the rotational hierarchy.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","11","\"2016 Draft Rnd 14 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"52.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2400","45","50","45","55","","","","50","50","55","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","60","50","","","","50","","",""],["199","197","212","265","252","\"49.0\"","\"47.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.1\"","\"45.6\"","\"51.6\"","\"|\"","\"JJ\"","\"Goss\"","2019","\"18.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"185\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2830","","\"goss_jj\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Cypress Ranch HS (TX)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2023","45","","\"Funky, athletic righty with arm strength and feel for spin.

While Thompson was more highly regarded entering 2019, Goss has outpitched him for the second straight spring and may have pushed himself into the first round.  Goss usually operates at 90-92 mph with his fastball, though he has reached 96 mph and should deal in the mid-90s more regularly once he fills out his very projectable 6-foot-3 frame. He has one of the better sliders in the high school ranks, a low-80s breaker with late bite and two-plane depth at times. He also has good feel for a changeup with similar velocity and some fade.

He slipped to the fifth round in his draft year as some scouts were worried his crossfire delivery was both an injury risk and the underlying reason for his command issues, and would be tough to 'correct.' The injury concerns were mostly accurate, as Szapucki had shoulder soreness that led into Tommy John surgery in July 2017. He's back on the mound and every indication is that he'll be able to return to his prior form, when he dominated the minor leagues to the tune of 116 strikeouts to 30 walks over 18 appearances before his arm trouble. Szapucki gets into the mid-90s with a plus curveball and flashes an average changeup from that tough slot and knows how to use his stuff to elicit chase swings, even though his control is average at best. The Mets have no plans to develop him in the bullpen in the short-term, but it seems very possible that his durability and style of pitching may fit best in a Josh Hader-type role.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2015, 5th (149) - NYM\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  Whenever Szapucki has been on the mound in the Mets' system since he was taken in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft, he's shown premium stuff from the left side. The trouble is he's had a hard time staying off the injured list, with a back issue that cut short an otherwise successful 2016 season, a shoulder impingement that delayed the start to his '17 and Tommy John surgery that cost him all of '18.  Szapucki has the makings of a very effective three-pitch mix when he's healthy. His explosive fastball is electric with plus life, and he throws it in the 92-97 mph range. His power breaking ball can be a second plus pitch which freezes hitters and misses bats. There's a solid changeup in there as well, one with terrific fade and sink, though it was less consistent than the other two offerings. He has a deceptive delivery with a slightly lower arm slot that can add to his effectiveness. His command comes and goes at times as he struggles with his direction to the plate.  Szapucki is plenty young enough to come back and continue his climb up the Mets' ladder, though his injuries have allowed him to throw only 83 pro innings since being drafted. If he can come back and show he can stay healthy, he has the stuff to contribute to a big league rotation, following a Steven Matz-like comeback path. At the least, a healthy Szapucki should be able to carve out a late-inning bullpen role on the merits of his two plus pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"A\"","10","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"53.3\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2400","40","60","40","60","","","","50","60","50","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","60","","","","","45","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["202","200","159","98","847","\"48.9\"","\"48.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"47.3\"","\"44.8\"","\"47.6\"","\"|\"","\"Andrew\"","\"Knizner\"","2019","\"24.3\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","290","6","\"|\"","1829","668800","\"knizner_andrew\"","19514","\"sa857827\"","\"|\"","77","\"North Carolina State\"","-1","1","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"_tdoPT13xtw\"","\"Knizner is a well-rounded bat at a position where there aren't many right now.

This, combined with an ability to guide the barrel around the zone, drives a promising, contact-first offensive package that would be quite valuable at catcher. Knizner moved from shortstop (in high school) to third base (as a college freshman) to catcher (as a sophomore) and has been behind the plate for four seasons now. He remains below-average in most aspects of catching, but isn't so bad that he'll surely have to move. He's not nearly as skilled a defender as Carson Kelly, but Knizner has a much better chance to make an offensive impact. Yadier Molina is signed through 2020, which creates the illusion of a catching logjam, but he's somewhat fragile and Knizer and Kelly's experience at corner infield spots (Knizner has played some first base as a pro, but did not in 2018) could enable the Cardinals to carry all three of them at some point.

The Cardinals, with a strong track record of finding college talent in the later rounds, nabbed Knizner in the seventh round of the 2016 Draft and signed him for $185,300. He made the jump directly from Class A to Double-A during his first full season, hitting .302 overall between the two levels, and then capped his year off with a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League. He followed it by hitting .313 and reaching Triple-A in 2018, earning a Futures Game selection along the way.   Knizner has shown a knack for barreling up the baseball as a pro, making lots of hard, line-drive contact to all fields en route to a .310 average in 242 games during his first three seasons. While his aggressive approach results in few walks, he also doesn't strike out much. Knizner's right-handed power is still developing and he should clear more fences as it does, though it's likely that he'll always have a hit-over-power profile.  Knizner is athletic behind the plate but still learning the nuances of the position, especially in terms of his receiving and calling a game. His arm strength is only average but plays up because he's accurate, and he stands to improve his pop times even more with better footwork. With Carson Kelly no longer in the picture after he was dealt to Arizona in an offseason trade, Knizner seems poised to back up Yadier Molina in the short term, with the potential to eventually succeed the veteran behind the plate.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AAA\"","2","\"2016 Draft Rnd 7 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"48.2\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","40","50","30","40","45","55","45","50","30","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","30","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SEA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["203","201","126","99","325","\"48.9\"","\"49.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"50.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"|\"","\"Brandon\"","\"Lowe\"","2019","\"24.9\"","\"2B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","200","4","\"|\"","1351","664040","\"lowe_brandon\"","18882","\"sa874181\"","\"|\"","46","\"Maryland\"","-1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","50","\"ZlJ75nn6Qok\"","\"Lowe's 2018 sample of big league at-bats was large enough to draw some real conclusions about his skillset.

The offense has taken off even more than those highest on him internally had expected, with some chance for 50 hit and 60 game power with passable defense at second, along with versatility to play left field and possibly first base if needed. Lowe is now in the weird prospect spot where he isn't the highly-drafted, tooled-up brand name type you typically find in the middle of a top 100, but he's about as low risk of a bat as there is with prospect eligibility, and he can also play up the middle, so his six years of control have tons of value to a small market team like the Rays.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"MLB\"","5","\"2015 Draft Rnd 3 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.9\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","45","55","50","40","45","50","55","55","50","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["204","202","324","374","145","\"48.8\"","\"46.1\"","\"45.0\"","\"52.4\"","\"33.6\"","\"54.1\"","\"|\"","\"Kevin\"","\"Alcantara\"","2019","\"16.9\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","180","4","\"|\"","2321","","","","\"sa3008752\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","0","","\"High\"","2024","45","","","\"We ranked Alcantara fourth among the 2018 international amateurs because he has some of the group's more advanced in-game feel to hit, he has a really good chance of not only staying in center field but might also be great there, and he has the best physical projection in the entire class.

Built like Lewis Brinson and Cody Bellinger were at the same age, Alcantara has better feel for contact than either of them did as teens. Hitters this size often struggle with strikeouts due to lever length and while Alcantara hasn't faced much pro quality velocity to stress test this aspect of his offense, there are no early indications that strikeouts are going to be an issue for him.

On the brink of 21, Tejeda is the age of draftable college players. Coincidentally, this year's draft has a similar type of talent who is similarly aged in UNC-Wilmington shortstop, Greg Jones. Both Tejeda and Jones are speedy shortstops with rare power for the position who also have issues making contact. Tejeda is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are just okay, so evaluations of his defense can vary depending on what individual scouts think is important to play the position, and some teams want to see him tried in center field.   Tejeda has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. We have Greg Jones in the 45 FV tier of the 2019 draft, which puts him in the mid-to-late first round; we like Tejeda a bit more than that and think he'd be in the 10-15 range on a draft board.

Signed for $100,000 out of the Dominican Republic two years earlier, he immediately demonstrated enticing power potential for a middle infielder. He has continued to do so, ranking second in total bases (205) and fifth in homers (19) as a 20-year-old in the Class A Advanced Carolina League last year.  Tejeda stands just 5-foot-11, but his combination of wiry strength, whippy swing and bat speed could develop into plus power. To get all the way there, he'll have to improve as a hitter, because he still gets too aggressive and pull-happy instead of letting his home runs come naturally. A natural left-handed hitter who has scuffled against southpaws in pro ball, he plans on switch-hitting in 2019 after previously batting from both sides as an amateur.  Tejeda significantly upgraded his defensive profile last season, erasing any doubts that he could stay at shortstop. Though he's an average runner, he has improved his instincts and range.

While there's creeping doubt about his ability to stay at shortstop -- some scouts have gone so far as to say he appears wholly disinterested in defense -- there's confidence in Nova doing well-rounded damage on offense. He's an athletic swinger with plus bat speed and bat control, and is especially adept at impacting pitches in the bottom of the strike zone.   For now, Nova's approach is rather hedonistic, and he's talented enough to make that work, at least for a while.

After he passed several subsequent drug tests, the Astros gave him a $1.2 million bonus when the signing period opened in July. He drew comparisons to Hanley Ramirez and Edgar Renteria as an amateur in the Dominican Republic, and he did nothing to dispel them in his first two years in Rookie ball.  Nova has a higher offensive ceiling than most shortstops and grades very well in Houston's analytic measures of strength, speed and conditioning. He makes repeated contact with his quick right-handed swing, and his high exit velocities and the loft in his stroke portend average or better power in the future. His plus speed could make him a 20-20 player and his only obvious need at the plate is to develop more patience.   Nova has all the tools to remain at shortstop.

He bounced back from forearm tendinitis as a junior to excel on the showcase circuit last summer, and his stock has continued to rise this spring. He also starred as a wide receiver and defensive back for Cary-Grove's Illinois 6-A state champion football team, catching a touchdown pass in the final playoff game.    Scouts love Priester's athleticism and the ease of his arm action. His four-seam fastball can reach 97 mph with riding life, though his heavy two-seamer in the low 90s may be even more effective because it gets exceptional horizontal and vertical movement. Gatorade's 2019 Illinois high school player of the year, he also owns one of the better curveballs in the 2019 prep class, sitting around 80 mph with tight spin and good depth.    Priester hasn't had much need for a changeup to this point and will need to achieve greater velocity separation from his fastball, but his athleticism and intelligence should help him develop it into an effective third pitch.

To limit his first year's workload, Garrett did not pitch during the summer of 2016. After some time in extended spring training, he was sent directly to Low-A. After three good starts he was knocked around in his fourth, and removed after 1.2 innings. He had surgery a month later. Though he didn't pitch during the summer, Garrett threw in Jupiter during the fall and sat mostly 91-92 with average secondaries. Given how little he's thrown, it would be reasonable for Garrett's stuff to be a little better across the board next year and look like it did in high school.

He had one of the best curveballs and some of the best polish in his high school crop, creating expectations that he could move quickly. But he made just four starts in his 2017 pro debut before undergoing Tommy John surgery and missing all of last season.  If he can regain his health and previous stuff, Garrett could be the best pitcher in the Marlins system. Before he got hurt, he not only had an upper-70s curveball with tight spin and impressive depth, but also showed the aptitude to land it for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. He also had a 90-94 mph fastball and showed similar velocity when he logged a few innings in Miami's instructional league program last fall, and he could add more power to his heater as he gets stronger.  Garrett's changeup gives him a solid third offering with which to attack hitters. All of his pitches play up because he commands and mixes them well.

He did look a little bit heavier than he had the year before, and his swing was more upright and less athletic than it has been, but all the physical tools to stay at short are still here (quick actions, sound footwork, plenty of arm) for now. Much of Ademan's offensive woes can be explained away by his age relative to the level. He doesn't project to be an impact bat, just one that is better than is usual at shortstop.

The best player from that crop is Ademan, who landed a $2 million bonus out of the Dominican Republic. His maturity has led Chicago to push him aggressively, and while he was able to handle low Class A at age 18 in 2017, he scuffled as the youngest regular in the high Class A Carolina League last year.  Though he batted just .207/.291/.273 in 2018, Ademan still displayed an efficient left-handed swing and an advanced approach. He recognizes pitches well and uses the entire field, though his rough season demonstrated his need to add strength. He won't ever be a slugger but needs more muscle in order to reach his potential as an above-average hitter with some occasional pull power.  Ademan's instincts allow him to play above his average speed on the bases and in the field. He has a good internal clock at shortstop, as well as the solid hands, range and arm to make plays there.

A back issue put Baez behind during 2018 spring training, and while the Padres sent him to Hi-A in late-April, his stuff and command were just not as good as they were the year before. Instead of 94-97, Baez's fastball was more 92-95, and his walk rate tripled. We're in wait-and-see mode with Baez now. He had a mid-rotation look in 2017, but fourth starter stuff and fringe command last year. After sitting 92-95 early in the spring, Baez was shut down with shoulder inflammation.

Though little was known about him at the time, Baez looks to be yet another coup for the organization's international scouting department. Behind a combination of physicality and stuff, he continued to climb the ladder in 2018, beginning the season in the Class A California League and then earning a promotion to Double-A at age 22.    A physically large and imposing presence on the mound who operates from a three-quarters slot, the 6-foot-8 Baez can generate plus-plus velocity with ease, though inconsistent mechanics can cause his velo to fluctuate. When he's right, he'll sit in the mid-90s and touch 98 mph. His best secondary pitch is an upper-80s slider with two-plane action that flashes above-average potential, and he'll also show feel for a curveball and changeup, with the latter projecting as the better pitch.    Repeating his delivery and pounding the strike zone is something Baez does better than most hurlers of comparable size, but he does struggle at times to keep his long limbs in sync and throws with too much crossfire, resulting in diminished stuff and below-average fastball command. More consistency on that front and improving his secondaries could help Baez become a mid-rotation starter, and some evaluators view the hulking right-hander as a future closer.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"AA\"","20","\"2016 J2 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"55.0\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2250","40","55","55","50","","","","50","60","65","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","50","55","","","","50","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["211","209","423","545","83","\"48.7\"","\"45.2\"","\"42.0\"","\"53.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"|\"","\"Ty\"","\"Buttrey\"","2019","\"26.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","168","4","\"|\"","529","621142","","14719","\"sa657997\"","\"|\"","","\"Providence HS (NC)\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","42","\"UvO2QaE7bOg\"","","\"Somewhat surprisingly, our pitch classifications indicate Buttrey threw his low-spin breaking ball more often than his obviously nasty changeup in a sizable big league sample last year.

Instead, Dubson missed much of the season and is on track for a likely 2019 debut. He'll be the first native Honduran to play in the majors. Dubon was acquired (along with Travis Shaw) as part of a lopsided package for Tyler Thornburg. His elite hand-eye coordination and bat control drive a contact-oriented offensive profile. Since coming over from Boston, Dubon has thickened his once frail-looking frame and improved upon some of the things that limited his in-game power. He was rotating better early in 2018, with the timing of his hip/hand spearation being better, too, and he was no longer ditching his leg kick with two strikes. His 2016 Portland and 2017-2018 Colorado Springs slugging outputs are probably cariacatures of his true talent level, but Dubon should at least have doubles power. Defensively, Dubon is passable at shortstop and second base. He saw time in center field during the 2016 Fall League but hasn't played there since. Lots of scouts like him as a super utility type, but Dubon will be 25 in July and he hasn't played anywhere other than the middle infield at any point in his career, save for that Fall League. It's more likely he gets a chance to be Milwaukee's everyday shortstop in 2019 and, provided he hasn't lost a step due to the ACL tear, we like him as a low-end regular there. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2013, 26th (773) - BOS\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 35 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  A Honduras native, Dubon signed with the Red Sox for $75,000 as a 26th-round pick in 2013, only to be dealt to the Brewers along with three other players in exchange for Tyler Thornburg in December 2016. He reached Triple-A in his first season with the Brewers, earning a SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game selection along the way, and the Brewers added Dubon to their 40-man roster after the season. Returning to Triple-A in 2018, Dubon got off to a strong start and seemed poised to join the Brewers in the big leagues until he required season-ending surgery to repair a torn ACL in May.  Dubon can do a little bit of everything on the diamond and offers more than the typical sum-of-all-parts player. He has excellent hand-eye coordination and a quick right-handed bat that helps him make barreled, line-drive contact with relative ease. He also has a good approach, and scouts project him as at least an average hitter. While he's enjoyed an uptick in power as he's grown stronger, Dubon is more likely to be a source of doubles and triples than home runs. He's able to tally some of those extra-base hits thanks to above-average speed that netted him at least 30 steals in three straight seasons.  Dubon has the quick hands and feet as well as the arm strength to make plays from either side of the bag. He split time in 2017 between both shortstop and second base, showing well at both spots, and it's fair to think he'll be able to play whatever position the Brewers ask of him.

Romero's stuff, and he has a full repertoire of weapons at his disposal, fluctuated at times particularly early in the year. He'll throw both a four- and two-seam fastball and can still get the former up to 95 mph, while he sinks the latter in the low 90s to get groundball outs. The life and deception he uses to throw his fastball allows it to nearly play up to a plus pitch. Both of his breaking balls will flash above-average and he mixes in a cutter to go along with a changeup that is plus at times.  At his best, Romero commands his fastball to both sides of the plate and goes right after hitters, something he struggled with in the early going a year ago. Strong and athletic, he shouldn't need too much more time to be ready for a gig as a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","\"AA\"","7","\"2016 Draft Rnd 4 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.4\"","\"52.9\"","\"46.3\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2600","45","45","50","50","","45","","55","45","55","55","","50","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","50","50","50","","","50","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["214","212","198","256","305","\"48.7\"","\"47.8\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"48.7\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Wil\"","\"Crowe\"","2019","\"24.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"240\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","348","640444","\"crowe_wil\"","","\"sa738488\"","\"|\"","","\"South Carolina\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2020","45","\"2bHk9XJKfn4\"","","\"Crowe turned down approximately $1 million out of a Tennessee high school and had a smaller market than his talent would indicate, due to some long-term questions about his elbow and knee. At South Carolina, he stood out as a freshman by staying healthy and showing the above average stuff he showed in high school. Then he blew out about halfway through his sophomore year, requiring Tommy John surgery. He missed all of 2017, then came back for an age-22 redshirt junior year and appeared to be all the way recovered, which lead to the Nationals taking him in the second round. Early in his career, Crowe looked to be on the same trajectory as Joba Chamberlain (who also slipped in the draft due to elbow and knee concerns), which would mean ending up in the bullpen while throwing in the high-90's with a power breaking ball. Post surgery, he's a little more starter-looking than that, working 91-94 and hitting 95 mph, with a changeup that has emerged as his best offspeed pitch, and a high-spin curveball and slider that both are average to above. Crowe has made progress with starter traits like pitch efficiency, and reading and setting up hitters, while his stamina is building to the point of handling a starter's workload. He'll open in the upper levels and could be big league rotation help as soon as in the second half of 2019.\"","\"|\"","","\"WAS\"","\"2017, 2nd (65) - WSH\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Crowe looked the part of a future first-rounder during his first season and a half at South Carolina before blowing out his elbow and requiring Tommy John surgery in mid-2015. After sitting out all of 2016 and then turning down Cleveland as a 21st-round pick, Crowe resuscitated his prospect status with the Gamecocks and became Washington's second-round pick in 2017. In his first full season, Crowe garnered Pitcher of the Year honors in the Class A Advanced Carolina League, going 11-0 with a 2.69 ERA in 16 games (15 starts) at Potomac before advancing to Double-A. He was named the organization's co-Pitcher of the Year with Ben Braymer.  Crowe's elbow reconstruction has had little impact on his velocity, as he spent 2018 pitching at 91-95 mph with a four-seam fastball that stands out for its high spin rate. His above-average curveball also features an impressive spin rate, which in turn gives it power and depth. His changeup arguably is his best secondary pitch, earning above-average grades from evaluators, and he also has feel for mixing in a slider.  Crowe wore down during the second half of his first full season, which prompted the Nationals to shut him down until fall instructional league. Big and physical, he should be able to handle a greater workload once he builds up the necessary strength.

He's well-conditioned, but short, built narrowly, and likely to max out with a frame similar to Brett Gardner's. And Thomas projects to have a similar skillset. It's rare that a high school hitter from Chicago is this polished, especially one as young as Thomas, who was barely 18 on draft day.   He runs well enough to project in center field (though his reads from the corners are much better right now and he might just be a plus corner glove, also like Gardner), which makes the unenthusiastic, frame-based power projection less concerning. There's some tweener fourth outfielder risk here because of the lack of power projection and potential move off of center field, but it's reasonable to hope some combination of contact, on base ability and defense make up for that and enable Thomas to be a regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"ARI\"","\"2018, 2nd (63) - ARI\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 60 | Arm: 40 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50  The son of White Sox director of strength and conditioning Allen Thomas, Alek grew up around the game and was a three-sport star at Mount Carmel High School in Chicago. He was viewed by many teams as a possible first-round pick heading into the 2018 Draft, so the D-backs were understandably thrilled to find him still on the board for them in the second round. They signed Thomas away from a Texas Christian commitment with a $1.2 million bonus, just above pick value, helping cushion the blow of not signing first-round pick Matt McLain, and then watched Thomas reach the Pioneer League during his introduction to pro ball.   Thomas has an advanced bat for a high school pick. He sends line drives to all fields with his compact left-handed stroke, impressive bat speed and mature approach at the plate. He has no trouble barreling quality fastballs and hit .333 across two levels in his pro debut. Though he's not very physical, his feel for the barrel and sneaky pop should produce at least 12-15 homers per year, not to mention plenty of doubles and triples, in pro ball. Thomas enhances his plus speed with good instincts on the bases and in center field. While he has below-average arm strength, it's playable in center field.   Thomas is more polished than the average high school pick and could move relatively quickly through the Minors now that he's focused on baseball.

Abreu, who was acquired from Houston as part of the Brian McCann deal, will regularly touch 101 with his fastball and has plus secondary stuff across the board. Career-long issues with strike-throwing, coupled with two consecutive years of multiple DL stints, continue to funnel Abreu toward a bullpen role, despite the depth of his repertoire. The appendicitis set back Abreu's spring preparation and he was DL'd for most of April while he caught up. He felt elbow discomfort at the end of June (he had elbow and shoulder issues in 2017, too), missed a month, made some nightmarish rehab starts in the GCL, then bounced back and had his usual stuff late in the year. While we believe it's increasingly likely that Abreu eventually winds up in relief, he has the stuff to work in a multi-inning, Josh Hader-like role in that scenario, and could become one of the top 20 or 30 relievers in the game. He may see his first big league action in 2019 but we don't expect he'll be up for good until 2020.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"Aug. 5, 2013 - HOU\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  When Gary Sanchez made Brian McCann redundant in New York, the Yankees traded McCann to the Astros in November 2016 for Abreu and fellow right-handed pitching prospect Jorge Guzman (whom they later spun to the Marlins in a deal for Giancarlo Stanton). Signed for $185,000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2013, Abreu has shown frontline-starter upside when healthy. A shoulder strain, appendectomy and elbow inflammation limited him to 126 innings in his first two seasons with his new organization, however.  All of Abreu's pitches grade out as plus or better when he commands them, beginning with a 94-98 mph fastball that tops out at 101 with sink and run. His power breaking ball can absolutely wipe out right-handers, combining curveball depth with slider velocity in the mid-80s. His fading changeup can shut down lefties, though it wasn't as effective in 2018 as it was in the past.  Abreu has a short-arm delivery that provides deception but sometimes hampers him from locating his pitches.

He had an up-and-down sophomore spring. Rolison came out of the chute blazing hot and had top-10 pick buzz for the first month of the season, then slowly regressed. Scouts thought he needed a delivery adjustment in to make him more direct to the plate, a way to improve his fastball control. They also thought he was too reliant on his curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and that he barely threw his changeup. It led to some bad outings, including one at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs.   Since being drafted, Rolison has worked more frequently with all three of his pitches, throwing 66% of his pitches for strikes, and his velocity has remained in the 92-94 range even as he throws every fifth day (mostly) rather than once a week.

The previous two, Kyle Freeland in 2014 and Tyler Anderson in 2011, were both in the big league rotation in 2018. They're hopeful that Rolison's polish and feel for pitching will allow him to join them sooner rather than later.  Rolison is the epitome of an advanced college lefty, one who should be able to use his four-pitch mix and outstanding feel for pitching. His best pitch is his plus curveball, a power breaking ball with depth that was one of the best breaking balls in his Draft class. He's able to manipulate it and turn it into a solid slider as well, and he has a fading changeup that he didn't use much last year but has shown a solid feel for in the past. All of those offerings support his 91-93 mph fastball that he commands extremely well. There might be a tick or two of velocity coming as he matures.  Not likely to be a huge strikeout guy, though that curve can miss bats, Rolison goes right after hitters, filling up the strike zone.

Then he singled and stole a base on the offensive end while throwing a perfect inning on the mound, serving notice that he might be the best two-way player in this Draft class. Scouts won't get the chance to see him this spring, however, as surgery to fix a small fracture in his throwing elbow will put him on the shelf until the summer.  The scouting industry is somewhat divided about where the 6-foot-7 left-hander's future lies. On the mound, he's up to 93 mph with his fastball, a pitch that's rarely straight. He has the ingredients of a very good curveball that could eventually be a plus pitch. It all comes from a projectable body and a delivery that works, giving hope that he'll find the strike zone more consistently and have the aptitude to add an effective third pitch as he gains more experience. Many thought he'd turn into a pitcher only, especially given his size, but he's shown he uses all those moving parts well as a position player. He's a plus runner and obviously, his arm works well, and he's played both the outfield and first base. He has a whip of a swing and is very unpolished, but some evaluators can dream on him as a hitter.

His circle changeup is often his most reliable secondary offering and helped him shackle left-handers with a .485 OPS last season.  The Astros have made alterations to Bielak's breaking pitches, switching him from a traditional to a spike curveball and helping him tighten his slider. He also has upgraded his control as a pro, enhancing his profile as a starter after scouts mostly envisioned him as a reliever when they saw him in college. He has a durable build and uses a high arm slot to overcome his lack of height and create downhill plane.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"AAA\"","10","\"2017 Draft Rnd 11 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.9\"","\"54.3\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2650","45","50","45","55","50","","","55","50","50","60","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","55","50","","","","50","","",""],["222","220","247","249","531","\"48.5\"","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.2\"","\"45.8\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Shane\"","\"McClanahan\"","2019","\"22.1\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"188\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2394","663556","\"mcclanahan_shane\"","","\"sa3008547\"","\"|\"","","\"USF\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","45","\"ntk-CU1Bo6A\"","","\"McClanahan was barely seen the summer before his senior year in high school, pitching in the low-to-mid-80s in the lightly-scouted southwest corner of Florida, and committed to a smaller mid-major school. In his senior spring, things starting changing; he was getting into the low-90s, but it was still raw enough and abrupt enough of a change that it made sense for McClanahan to go to school, now committed to South Florida. He had another velo bump early in his college career, which eventually led to Tommy John surgery. Buzz grew in scouting circles as his post-surgery stuff was elite and after his first start of 2018, a heavily-scouted matchup with North Carolina, McClanahan looked like a top five overall pick. In that game, he hit 100 mph and flashed an above average slider and changeup along with enough feel to project as a starter. From then on, things started to unravel, until the Rays popped the local kid 31st overall. McClanahan had some minor issues -- a finger injury and fluctuating velo as weather and workload dictated -- but more worrisome to scouts were both his maturity and how he fared when his fastball was more of a 6 than an 8, and his command was a 3 or 4 instead of a 5. Most college pitchers can succeed with 55 or 60 stuff and below average command, but McClanahan struggled and showed it on the mound. The optimistic case is that a change of scenery, coaching, and workload (with less pressure) will help tease out that top five overall pick version of McClanahan, while the pessimistic case is that what we saw down the stretch is indicative of a future as a streaky power reliever with limited feel.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2018, 1C (31) - TB\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  McClanahan spurned the Mets as a 26th-rounder in 2015 and honored his commitment to South Florida, only to have his freshman year wiped out by Tommy John surgery. He emerged as one of more interesting pitching prospects in the 2018 Draft as a junior by ranking second in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings (14.2), though a regression in command cost him some traction late in the spring. He still became a first-round pick in June, going to the Rays with the No. 31 overall pick, and received a slightly above-slot bonus of $2,230,100. McClanahan impressed during his brief pro debut, making four scoreless starts during which he fanned 13 and allowed three hits across seven innings.   McClanahan's Draft stock took off early last spring with reports of the left-hander's fastball reaching 100 mph. It set an unfair standard for his future outings, and some teams were turned off when he failed to achieve the same elite velocity in subsequent starts. That being said, McClanahan does throw exceptionally hard, as he'll sit 92-95 mph and reach back for a few extra ticks. McClanahan's slider, though inconsistent, is an above-average pitch and complements his heater nicely, and scouts believe that his upper-80s changeup will be at least average once he develops better feel.   McClanahan's high strikeout rate in college came with a high walk rate. That, plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil, has led some evaluators to project him as a future reliever -- albeit one who could get to the big leagues in a hurry. But with a loose and very athletic frame, McClanahan might be able to get away with those mechanics, and the Rays are committed to developing him as a starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"A+\"","21","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"50.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2700","40","60","45","50","","","","45","65","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","50","","55","","","","45","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["223","221","216","164","601","\"48.5\"","\"47.6\"","\"47.9\"","\"48.8\"","\"37.9\"","\"49.8\"","\"|\"","\"Tyler\"","\"Freeman\"","2019","\"20.0\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","280","6","\"|\"","2045","671289","\"freeman_tyler\"","","\"sa3004755\"","\"|\"","","\"Etiwanda HS (CA)\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2022","45","\"eOEmTzaPck0\"","","\"A young, polished, but relatively unexplosive high schooler, Freeman was a bit of a surprise second rounder in 2017 but has quickly become much more interesting thanks to a sterling 2018 season with Mahoning Valley. As a 19-year-old, he hit .352/.405/.511 for the Scrappers, torching even the loftiest of expectations set by scouts who saw him during extended spring training and mostly considered Freeman a future utility man. Fundamentally sound at short, he lacks the explosiveness and big arm strength scouts look for at the position, and we wonder if Freeman will hit for enough power to be an impact player at any other position.   His early career strikeout rate (7.5% in about 450 PA) suggests his bat-to-ball skills are even more promising than amateur scouts anticipated, though he's also an aggressive swinger who has been hit by nearly twice as many pitches as he has walks so far. When scouts talk about a player having 'feel, polish, instincts' and the like, and the player has numbers like Freeman's contact rates, we typically round up on that player. In Freeman's case, we remain cautious because the eyeball scouts are so resolute in their skepticism of the power projection.\"","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","\"2017, CBB (71) - CLE\"","","2021","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  One of the top high school hitters in Southern California in 2017, Freeman passed up a strong commitment to Texas Christian to sign for $816,500 as a supplemental second-rounder. After a solid pro debut, he had a spectacular '18, topping the short-season New York-Penn League in hitting (.352), runs (49), hits (95), doubles (29), extra-base hits (35) and total bases (138). He has the highest offensive ceiling among Cleveland's deep pool of young infielders, not to mention some of the best leadership ability and work ethic in the system.   Freeman's elite bat-to-ball skills produce repeated line-drive contact from the right side of the plate. He has such advanced feel for hitting that he could develop close to average power once he adds more strength and drives the ball in the air more often. If there's a knock on his offensive game, it's that he puts the ball in play almost too easily, as he drew only eight walks in 301 plate appearances last year.  Freeman's instincts also stand out on the bases and in the field, where he plays better than his average speed. He's an aggressive runner and proficient basestealer. He has sure hands and makes up for an average arm at shortstop with a quick release, though his tools may fit better at second base.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CLE\"","\"A\"","9","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (CLE)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"34.1\"","\"50.0\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","30","40","55","40","45","55","45","45","50","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","50","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["224","222","207","250","265","\"48.5\"","\"47.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.0\"","\"45.8\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","\"Jackson\"","\"Kowar\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1313","663804","\"kowar_jackson\"","","\"sa3008273\"","\"|\"","","\"Florida\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","45","\"6Gnu6dq3LLQ\"","","\"Kowar had a seven-figure asking price coming out of high school, which was just out of reach of what clubs were willing to commit from their spending pools. He was set to head to Clemson until a late coaching change caused him to reconsider his commitment, and the Tigers ultimately lost him to Florida (and Cal Raleigh to Florida State). Kowar's velocity ticked up before he even played in an official game for the Gators, sitting 93-95 and hitting 97 mph in preseason scrimmages before his freshman year. He kept that velocity throughout his college career and developed a plus changeup.   The two issues for Kowar are his very short stride, which causes his velocity to play down, and his breaking ball, which is not great. It's still most often a below average pitch, with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape. Cogent pitch design may help the pitch, or indicate the Royals should just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. These issues are almost identical to Luke Weaver's coming out of Florida State; he's appeared to have solved those at times, though not at others.\"","\"|\"","","\"KC\"","\"2018, 1C (33) - KC\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  For most of his college career at Florida, Kowar pitched behind ace Brady Singer. At the start of the dynamic duo's junior season in 2018, there were some scouts who thought Kowar might be better long-term, though Singer rose to the top and Kowar slotted in as a very nice 1a. Much to the delight of the Royals, both college arms were available to them, so the Gators can now be Royals together as well, and Kowar made a nice first impression during his brief summer debut in the South Atlantic League.  Kowar has the chance to have three at least average pitches, with his fastball and changeup standing out as plus offerings. His changeup is his best pitch, thrown with excellent deception and arm speed that tumbles and fades. His fastball will top out at 97 and sit more in the 94-95 mph range. A solid strike thrower, Kowar's fastball command has room for improvement as he learns to repeat his delivery more consistently, but it's not a red flag in any way. When he was first drafted, it was suggested to the Royals player development staff that they look at a slider instead of what had been an inconsistent curveball in college. But Kowar spun a better version of the pitch during his debut, with good shape, and it's now an average breaking ball with a chance to be better than that.  Kowar gets high marks for holding runners well and fielding his position, and his athleticism should help him maximize his delivery long term. He has the potential to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","\"A+\"","9","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"52.5\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2150","40","55","55","40","","","","50","55","60","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","50","","","","","50","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["225","223","208","251","251","\"48.5\"","\"47.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.1\"","\"45.4\"","\"51.6\"","\"|\"","\"Jhoan\"","\"Duran\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1994","661395","","","\"sa873347\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"nj13l4r6Qug\"","\" \"","\"Duran seemingly drew lots of trade interest while with Arizona. Loose, lean, and wielding premium stuff, his name was rumored to be on some PTBNL lists before he was ultimately traded to Minnesota as part of the Eduardo Escobar deal in 2018. During his first few pro seasons, Duran's velocity yo-yo'd a bit; he was at times in the upper-90s, while more 91-95 at others. He was also demoted from the Northwest League back to the AZL in 2017 for reasons seemingly unrelated to performance. The following spring, not only was Duran's velocity more stable -- in the 93-96 range -- but he was throwing strikes and had more consistent secondary stuff.   While he can spin a good breaking ball, Duran's best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells with electric arm speed. He worked with better angle after the Twins acquired him last summer, a change that improved the playability of his breaking ball without taking away from his changeup's movement. Now a physically mature, 230-pound 21-year-old, Duran seems poised to take a bit of a leap and perhaps reach the Florida State League later in the year. He may end up with three impact pitches if his secondaries have yet another gear of quality left to claim, which makes him a threat for the top 100 list either later this year or next.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","","\"Dec, 13, 2014 - ARI\"","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  When deals are made at the Trade Deadline, it can often be years before the trade can be truly evaluated.

Duran did show glimpses of his enormous upside during his full-season debut in 2018, leaving the Twins very excited to see what he can do in his first full season in the organization.  Duran has an exciting repertoire that points to a future in a big league rotation. He relies heavily on two distinct fastballs, a four-seamer that sits at 94-96 mph and touches 98 mph and a two-seamer that's a cross between a sinker and a splitter, thrown 90-93 miph, that misses a ton of bats and drives his strikeout rate. He can spin a curveball, flashing a plus breaking ball, and it's a point of focus for him in 2019. His changeup still needs work, but it has the chance to be an average pitch eventually. He's continued to refine his delivery and improve his command and control.  There's still more in the tank for the 6-foot-5 Duran and he could make a big leap up prospect lists as he moves up another level in 2019.

The Rangers held all of their high school pitchers from the early rounds out of game action to concentrate on learning and conditioning after they turned pro, but he still succumbed to Tommy John surgery this May and won't make his pro debut until 2020.  White has the potential for a deep arsenal with plus pitches across the board. His fastball velocity fluctuates because he's still adding muscle to his lean frame, but there are times when he'll sit at 93-95 mph with armside run and that should happen more often as he gets stronger. Though he flashed a plus slider in high school, the Rangers are having him focus on a curveball with high spin rates, and he also has advanced feel for a fading changeup.

He'll move up this list with a full year of innings at his 2018 level of performance.

The right-hander separated himself with his performance and projectability and the Twins took him in the fifth round that June, going above slot to sign him away from his Auburn commitment. After two summers in the Gulf Coast League, he took a nice step forward while pitching full-season ball for the first time.  Balazovic made very good strides during extended Spring Training and that carried over into his 2018 Midwest League debut. The big right-hander had plenty left in the tank at the end of the year, living in the 92-94 mph range and consistently up to 95 mph with his fastball. He throws it with good sinking action to get groundball outs. His changeup has improved quite a bit and while he can still throw it a bit too hard, in the 85-86 mph range, it has more movement and because of his uptick in velocity, there's more separation between the two pitches. The slider is still his go-to breaking ball and it flashes plus at times.  There could still be more in the tank as Balazovic continues to fill out his 6-foot-4 frame, giving him considerable ceiling.

Walston is young for the class, is ultra projectable, is an above average athlete, and throws two versions of his curveball with the harder slurve flashing 65- or 70-grade when it's on while the slow one is a consistent 60.

He led the state with 4,340 passing yards and the Wildcats to a 3-AA state title in 2017, then continued to shine in 2018. His future definitely is in baseball, however, as he's the best prospect from New Hanover since the Red Sox made Trot Nixon the seventh overall choice in the 1993 Draft.    Scouts don't have a lot of history with Walston and his projectability is more attractive than his present stuff, but he could fit in the top two rounds if he's signable away from North Carolina State, where he'd concentrate solely on baseball. He's a quality athlete with a good arm action and delivery, fills the strike zone and still has the room to add 40-50 pounds to his lanky 6-foot-4 frame. If he goes to college, gets stronger and develops as expected, he could be one of the first players selected in the 2022 Draft.    Gatorade's 2019 North Carolina high school player of the year and a catalyst behind back-to-back state 3-A baseball championships, Walston has shown glimpses of what he can become by working with a riding 90-93 mph fastball early in some games, but he'll also sit in the upper 80s at times and dip to 85 mph late in contests. He has natural feel for spinning the ball and has promising depth on his curveball, though it currently parks in the low 70s. He also can throw a lateral-breaking slider and flash an interesting changeup, though he doesn't use either offering much at this point.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","","11","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","34","26","\"ARI\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.3\"","\"53.3\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","0.0000","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","45","40","55","","","","50","55","50","65","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","60","50","","","","50","","",""],["231","229","534","792","284","\"48.3\"","\"44.4\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.8\"","\"46.3\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Jensen\"","2019","\"21.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"180\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2895","","\"jensen_ryan\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Fresno State\"","2","1","","\"High\"","2022","40","\"oQKQsrt6oL0\"","\"Popped up in the fall hitting 99 mph and has continued to progress this spring, sitting in the mid-90's.\"","\"Jensen had one of the best arms in the 2019 Draft.

Jensen has arm strength to spare, with a fastball that sits from 94-98 mph. He's able to maintain his velocity deep into his starts, showing plenty of 97-98 mph heaters in the seventh and eighth inning of his starts. When he finds his arm slot, it can have plus life, but he often loses it, causing it to be flat and very hittable. His slider will show flashes of being an above-average pitch, but it's not consistent. He does have an upper-80s changeup with some fade that might be average, but he doesn't use it much. Jensen has a tendency to over stride at times, which makes it tougher for him to repeat his delivery and command the baseball.   With some effort to his delivery and an undersized frame, many see Jensen moving to the bullpen, with his power stuff playing up and allowing him to move more quickly.

A 2017 breakout that saw Castro slug .424 at Hi-A Lynchburg seemed to be a mirage when he hit just .245/.303/.350  for three months at Double-A Akron (that power output is closer to career norms), but after the trade Castro slugged .562 and his ground ball rate dropped from 44% to 33% in about a 100 balls-in-play sample, which should be fairly stable. If there's suddenly more lift here then Castro could be a top 100 prospect by mid year. He's going to stay at short (plus range, average hands, above-average arm) but the average big league shortstop had a 95 wRC+ last year and Castro is a very aggressive hitter likely to run below-average OBPs. If there's been a swing change (his swing with Cleveland was not conducive of power) then extra pop might propel Castro toward toward regular playing time.

He started to put it all together as a 20-year-old in 2017 when he finished among the Carolina League leaders in hits (second), batting average (fourth) and runs scored (sixth). The Indians rewarded him with a spot on their 40-man roster after the season. A move to Double-A in 2018 proved a challenge for Castro, but the Tigers saw enough offensive upside to get him in exchange for Leonys Martin at the Trade Deadline in July. He made a strong impression in his Tigers organizational debut following the trade, hitting .317/.353/.516 over 31 games and finishing the season at Triple-A Toledo.   Castro is unique in the sense that he's a switch-hitter who produces similar splits. He knows how to get the barrel to the ball and makes line-drive contact from both sides of the plate. He's begun to tap into some power as he's filled out physically, and given his remaining projection, double-digit home run totals seem like a possibility. While his approach continues to be highly aggressive, his strikeout and walk rates have held steady during his climb through the Minors. An above-average runner, Castro has stolen at least 16 bags in three straight seasons but still has gains to make in his efficiency.  A loose and athletic infielder, Castro has the necessary soft hands, actions and arm strength to stick at shortstop. He's at least an above-average defender there, and he showed more consistency last season by committing just 15 errors after back-to-back 25-error campaigns.

His secondary stuff is pretty pedestrian, but everything of his plays up against left-handed hitters because Marquez has a weird, sawed off, low-slot arm action. He'll need to develop better ways to deal with right-handed hitters, either via command or better secondary stuff, and ultimately Marquez projects as a no. 4 starter because one cannot live on velo alone, but the elite arm strength means his ceiling is higher than that if the Cubs can work some magic with his stuff.\"","\"|\"","","\"CHC\"","","\"Aug. 23, 2015 - CHC\"","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Marquez's $600,000 bonus was the largest given to a left-hander on the international amateur market in 2015. The Cubs liked the Dominican's projectable 6-foot-4 frame and his ability to reach the low 90s, and he has developed into one of the hardest-throwing young southpaws anywhere in the Minors. They've handled him carefully, limiting him to a total of 153 1/3 innings in his first three seasons, though he still advanced to Class A at age 19.  Marquez's fastball topped out at 95 mph in 2017 and sat at 93-96 and peaked at 99 last season with typical four-seamer riding action. His secondary pitches can vary wildly in consistency, with his breaking ball showing flashes of becoming a plus power curve but also devolving into a slurve when he doesn't stay on top of it. His changeup is less reliable, showing some life but often arriving too firm in the low 90s.  Since coming to the United States in 2017, Marquez has had no problem throwing strikes. But his low-three-quarters arm slot and his mechanics lead some scouts to worry about his ability to master his secondary offerings and his command.

Pitching as a 19-year-old in the New York-Penn League, he posted a 2.35 ERA with a 0.96 WHIP and a circuit-best .171 opponents' average in 61 1/3 frames. Linares' move up to full-season ball in 2018 came with even better results, most notably a strikeout rate that jumped to 10.4 K/9 from 8.8 the previous year. He walked fewer hitters and built upon his workload from the previous year.   Linares stands out for his remaining physical projection, as he already shows a fast arm with plenty of room to grow into his 6-foot-2, 170-pound frame. That leads scouts to believe he'll add more velocity to a fastball that currently sits in the low-90s and bumps 94. His curveball is an above-average offering, one thrown with tight spin and late biting action, and he also shows some feel for a changeup.  That Linares is athletic and has a clean, repeatable arm action aids him as a strike-thrower, and he should develop at least average command as well.

He expressed frustration with the ordeal afterward and has stayed healthy as a pro while making his big league debut ahead of schedule last July.  Perez's polish and small stature belie his fastball, which sat around 90 mph in Cuba but now averages 94 mph and reaches 98 with heavy sink that produces ground balls when it doesn't dodge bats. He backs up his heater with a mid-80s slider that has gotten tighter since he turned pro. He can flash a solid changeup with fade, though it lacks consistency, and can also mix in a slow curveball.  Though he's undersized, Perez has the repertoire and delivery to make it as a starter. He repeats his mechanics, throws strikes and generally keeps his pitches down in the zone.

Garcia could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the Nationals of the same name who was also born in the same year. The Phillies' Garcia has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 BABIP, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff Garcia too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which Garcia could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that Garcia has become close friends with Alec Bohm; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in Philadelphia. Garcia will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the Nationals' Luis Garcia did this past year; that Garcia reached High-A at age 18.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - PHI\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 35 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Sometimes it takes a young prospect to get his professional legs under him, especially if it's a young player just signed out of the Dominican Republic. Then there are prospects like Garcia, who signed with the Phillies for $2.5 million in July 2017 and hit the ground running, making his professional debut in the United States and winning the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2018.  It's hard not to get excited about Garcia's tools, though it should be tempered with the fact that much of it is projection and the teenager has a long way to go. He's still not very big, with strength gains to come, but he showed a solid approach from both sides of the plate during his debut, making consistent contact and drawing some walks. There's raw power to tap into there and it should come as he matures. His defensive acumen might outstrip his bat, at least for now.

Garcia could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the Nationals of the same name who was also born in the same year. The Phillies' Garcia has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 BABIP, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff Garcia too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which Garcia could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that Garcia has become close friends with Alec Bohm; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in Philadelphia. Garcia will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the Nationals' Luis Garcia did this past year; that Garcia reached High-A at age 18.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - PHI\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 35 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Sometimes it takes a young prospect to get his professional legs under him, especially if it's a young player just signed out of the Dominican Republic. Then there are prospects like Garcia, who signed with the Phillies for $2.5 million in July 2017 and hit the ground running, making his professional debut in the United States and winning the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2018.  It's hard not to get excited about Garcia's tools, though it should be tempered with the fact that much of it is projection and the teenager has a long way to go. He's still not very big, with strength gains to come, but he showed a solid approach from both sides of the plate during his debut, making consistent contact and drawing some walks. There's raw power to tap into there and it should come as he matures. His defensive acumen might outstrip his bat, at least for now.

The right-hander was a consistent member of the Triple-A rotation, making his big league debut last July.  De Los Santos has two pitches, his fastball and changeup, that are ready to get big league hitters out. He'll throw his fastball typically in the 92-95 mph range and will sit at 93-94 with comfort, showing the ability to reach back for a bit more at times. He'll miss bats and get groundball outs with it when he's at his best. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, one that flashes plus and has good fade to it. His breaking ball remains behind his other two offerings. On a good day, he'll show an average pitch, but it's often slurvy and some see it as more of a slider than a curveball.  Just 23 for all of the 2019 season, De Los Santos has shown he has the durability to remain in a rotation and the Phillies aren't ready to give up on him as a starter just yet.

Then word started to trickle out that the kid who had missed the summer and fall showcases with an ACL tear had turned into a completely different player, one who now had 70 bat speed. Early in the spring, videos of his first few majestic homers led to a rush of national crosscheckers and scouting directors getting in to see Beck, as most of them never had before. It's rare for a prep hitter to land in the first 10 picks with only one spring of looks and data, none of it on TrackMan, and almost none of it against pro-quality pitching, but Beck's tools were just that loud: 70 bat speed, easy plus raw power, plus speed, and a plus arm.   It's similar to how Clint Frazier looked at the same stage, though Frazier had a long summer of production, faced strong prep competition, and still only went fifth overall. Beck's pro debut revealed some weaknesses that aren't evident against mediocre prep pitching and he was clearly overmatched in the AZL during his first pro summer and often visibly frustrated. He was 19 in Low-A last year and was able to hit for average, but very little power. Like Frazier, Beck has a good chance to lose a step as his body matures, and move to right field as a result, so pressure is on the bat. Pro scouts don't see the impact power that amateur scouts saw. We're cautiously optimistic that improved strength and swing work will tease out more game power during his age-20 season in the hitter-friendly Cal League.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2017, 1st (6) - OAK\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  When the high school season began back in 2017, Beck was a bit of an unknown quantity because he had missed the previous summer after tearing his left ACL and meniscus that May. A big senior season in North Carolina sent him soaring up Draft boards and the A's were even more confident his tools would play after a pre-Draft workout, so they nabbed him with the No. 6 overall pick and gave him a franchise-record $5,303,000 to sign. His pro debut that summer was uneven, at best, but he turned in a solid full-season debut in 2018 as a Midwest League All-Star.  Beck's tools are undeniable, though he is still learning to use them consistently on the field. While he hit close to .300 in 2018 and led his league in hits, he still needs to refine his overall approach to see more pitches and work counts more effectively. He does have the bat speed that should allow him to continue to hit for average, while that improved approach should allow him to tap into his very good raw power more than he's been able to so far in his brief pro career.  With excellent speed and athleticism, Beck has the skills to play center field, the only spot he's manned so far as a pro, while he has the arm strength to profile in right field should he slow down as he matures. His power will have to show up for him to profile well there, but there's plenty of time for that, and all facets of his game, to develop.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"A+\"","4","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.0\"","\"52.3\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","60","40","60","45","55","65","55","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","60","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["241","238","197","241","223","\"48.2\"","\"47.8\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Clarke\"","\"Schmidt\"","2019","\"23.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2094","657376","\"schmidt_clarke\"","","\"sa3007582\"","\"|\"","","\"South Carolina\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","45","","","\"In 2017, Schmidt turned a corner in his draft spring for South Carolina and looked likely to land in the middle of the first round, flashing four above average pitches and starter command for a No. 3 to 4 starter profile.

Schmidt pitches off of a 92-94 mph fastball that peaks at 96 and generates ground balls with heavy sink. While both his mid-80s slider and low-80s curveball can be plus pitches at times, they sometimes lack consistency. There are days when his tumbling changeup is his best secondary offering, though his breaking balls are generally more reliable.  Schmidt has a history of throwing strikes but can get knocked around when he doesn't keep his pitches down in the strike zone. His 6-foot-1 frame doesn't create a lot of downhill plane on his pitches, and his size and less-than-smooth delivery created concerns about his durability even before he blew out his elbow.

He immediately showed his prodigious power, along with a penchant for striking out, during his United States debut in '16. Both were on display in his '18 full-season debut as he hit 31 homers and struck out 131 times just 94 games. His season was cut short by a freakish thumb injury, but not before he showed off his pop with an opposite-field blast in the Futures Game.  Matias has as much raw power as just about anybody in Minor League baseball, with some evaluators saying putting an 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale on it would not be outlandish. The big question is whether he can make enough contact to continue to get to that power in games. When he's going well, Matias lays off breaking balls early in count, but he has a very high chase rate out of the strike zone early in at-bats. There's always going to be some swing and miss to his game, but even some modest improvement in his approach should allow him to be a middle-of-the-order run producer.

The tools are for real: plus raw power, plus arm strength, above-average bat control, speed and defense in right field and, until 2018, an unassailable record of performance. Still, corner-only hitters with approach issues -- Hays is a free swinger with a pull-heavy approach -- run the risk of having their lack of discernment taken advantage of in the majors with little defensive value left to fall back on. After reaching Baltimore in 2017, 2018 was a nightmare for Hays: he struggled out of the gate, had his approach tinkered with to try to fix things only to have it not work, then injured his ankle and needed surgery. He missed two months and continued struggling when he returned. Some rival clubs see a buy-low opportunity and would love to take a chance on Hays' tools, but the Orioles probably aren't selling low, with the rebuilding club offering an easy road to MLB playing time for the foreseeable future. There's big offensive talent here if Hays can bounce back and find an approach that works in the big leagues. He's volatile, though, and will be 24 in July, so this spring and early season are pretty important.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2016, 3rd (91) - BAL\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  After transferring from Seminole State (Fla.) JC to Jacksonville, Hays erupted to hit an Atlantic Sun Conference-best 16 home runs as a junior, leading to his selection in the third round of the 2016 Draft. He became the first player from his class to reach the Majors the next year, earning a September promotion straight from Double-A after he'd produced a .329 average with 32 homers and 32 doubles across two levels. In 2018, Hays was limited by a sore shoulder during the spring and then lost nearly two months of the season to a stress fracture in his ankle that ultimately required offseason surgery.  Hays showed during his first full season that he has the physical strength, bat speed and barrel control needed to hit for average and power at the highest level. While injuries robbed him of some of that explosiveness in 2018, Hays also deviated from the hit-to-all-fields mentality that had made him successful in the previous year, as he all too often sold out for pull-side power in an attempt to replicate his 2017 results. He generally has an aggressive approach that leads to a lot of contact but nets him few walks, thus underscoring how Hays' on-base skills are linked to his production.  Hays has played all three outfield positions as a pro, but profiles best in right field because he has average speed and range as well as plus arm strength. He will need to hit for average and power to hold down the position in the big leagues, and the Orioles are confident that a fully healthy Hays will be able to get back on track toward reaching his potential in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AAA\"","6","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"49.5\"","\"53.2\"","\"50.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","45","60","55","50","60","50","50","60","55","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.650","\"2nd\""],["244","241","172","243","99","\"48.2\"","\"48.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"53.1\"","\"48.5\"","\"53.6\"","\"|\"","\"Zac\"","\"Lowther\"","2019","\"23.1\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"235\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2150","675912","\"lowther_zac\"","","\"sa915645\"","\"|\"","","\"Xavier\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","45","\"wVeEOHsnDns\"","","\"Lowther is the kind of prospect who grows on you the more you watch him and once you see his Trackman readout. At first blush, he's an unimpressive athlete who sits around 90 mph with his fastball, and throws from a lower slot that makes you wonder if he's an obvious reliever. Sure, the curveball flashes plus and you've noticed he commands all of his pitches, which might enable an average changeup to be a successful third weapon. As you dig a little deeper, you notice that Lowther hides his arm behind his body for much of his delivery and that he has nearly seven feet of down-mound extension, which screws with hitters' feel for timing his fastball and helps it play up.   Most scouts don't like pitchers who work up in the strike zone, but there is a specific type who can make this work and we think Lowther is exactly that type. The formula is to get down the mound, throw from a lower release point, and have a fastball that 'rises'' -- that's rare to create from a low slot -- and command it to parts of the zone where hitters are vulnerable; Lowther does all of these things. He has below-average velocity, but we think the fastball is a 55 pitch with these separators, and some scouts think his changeup plays up for the same reason. With all that in mind, you see Lowther in a different light: as a durable innings-eating starter with a long track record of success, three 55-to-60 grade pitches and command, along with the pitchability and deception qualities that help ensure he'll still stick in a rotation if his raw stuff takes a step backward. Lowther turns 23 in April and likely starts the season in Double-A, but he may be one of the top five starters in the Orioles organization by midseason. He's about as low risk of a pitching prospect as you'll see among those who haven't been above A-ball.

The left-hander has continued to pile up strikeouts since entering the professional ranks, as he posted a 12.4 K/9 during his pro debut and followed it with 11.0 K/9 in his first full season, much of which he spent at Class A Advanced Frederick.  Lowther's track record of missing bats is testament to his dominant fastball. He throws the pitch with only fringy velocity, sitting at 87-91 mph and occasionally bumping a few ticks higher. However, the massive extension he generates to the plate, combined with his fast arm and slightly lower slot, gives the pitch a high spin rate and late riding life that enables him to consistently beat hitters within and above the strike zone. An above-average curveball and a tumbling, low-80s changeup that's at least average comprise Lowther's secondary arsenal, and he keeps hitters off balance with both pitches.   Physically mature and durable, Lowther has long shown that he can handle a heavy workload. That trait alone suggests the floor of a No. 5 starter, and it would surprise no one within the organization if Lowther, with his unique profile and arsenal, were to further his success and ultimately surpass that projection.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","9","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"55.0\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2550","45","55","45","55","","","","55","55","50","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","","","","","55","\"SEA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["245","242","257","234","581","\"48.1\"","\"47.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"48.9\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jorge\"","\"Mateo\"","2019","\"23.9\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"192\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","982","622761","","","\"sa657910\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","2","-1","","\"High\"","2019","45","\"E87r8QWTQ8c\"","","\"Not only was Mateo unable to carry his torrid 60-game offensive stretch at Double-A into 2018 (half with New York before the 2017 Sonny Gray trade, half with Oakland after it), but he had his worst statistical season to date, as he reached base just 28% of the time.   He remains one of the more physically gifted players not only in this system, but in all of the minor leagues. He is a no-doubt 80 runner who circled the bases during an inside-the-park home run in the Dominican this winter in just 14.40 seconds. That's approaching Byron Buxton territory even though Mateo paused on his way to first and slowed up as he approached and needlessly slid in to home. He also has above-average raw power that he has never manifested in games due to a variety of issues that make it unlikely he ever will. His lower half usage in the box is sub-optimal, he too often expands the zone, and he frequently settles for middling, opposite-field contact.   These have been Mateo's issues for over seven years now, and with each passing season, they're less and less likely to improve. But because Mateo has such prodigious athletic gifts and is going to play somewhere up the middle (he has the physical tools for shortstop and has looked fine there in big league trials this spring, but remains procedurally immature), he's likely to force his way on the field somehow, and he has a better chance of making a big league impact than everyone below him on this list. That's probably as a low-end regular or utility type, with a dwindling chance for stardom if the tools suddenly actualize.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","","\"Jan. 28, 2012 - NYY\"","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 80 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  For much of his Minor League career with the Yankees, Mateo was viewed as a super-talented, yet enigmatic prospect. He was, once upon a time, that organization's top prospect, but a lackluster 2016 season caused his star to fade. A light seemed to go off in 2017 with a push to Double-A and he kept producing when the A's acquired him that July in the Sonny Gray deal. He wasn't able to replicate that success as he moved to Triple-A in 2018.  Mateo's best tool remains his top-of-the-scale speed that has allowed him to wreak havoc on the basepaths. He stole 82 bases back in 2015 and 52 in that resurgent '17 season, though he managed to swipe only 25 in his first full season with Oakland. Much of that has to do with his offensive regression which resulted in him not getting on base nearly as frequently. His strikeout rate jumped while his walk rate decreased, showing poor plate discipline and pitch selection. At his best, he has shown surprising pop with the wheels to take extra bases often.   Mateo gets high grades for his defensive work at shortstop, with plus range and a very strong arm, though he still loses focus and can be inconsistent at the premium position. He saw a little time at second base in 2018 and played the outfield with the Yankees, so if the bat doesn't come back around, he eventually could end up as a speedy utility type.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"AAA\"","5","\"2011 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","55","80","45","55","40","45","55","80","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","80","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"COL\"","0.500","\"1st\""],["246","243","243","235","530","\"48.1\"","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.2\"","\"46.7\"","\"49.4\"","\"|\"","\"Matt\"","\"Thaiss\"","2019","\"24.1\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1556","642136","\"thaiss_matt\"","","\"sa738522\"","\"|\"","","\"Virginia\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","45","\"E-xCNHw7HiE\"","","\"Thaiss is one for whom a 2018 swing change is more relevant because a lack of in-game power was the primary barrier between him and the offensive output approaching that which typically profiles at first base. A college catcher, Thaiss walked more than twice as much as he struck out as a junior at Virginia. Though almost nobody thought he'd be able to catch in pro ball, he was viewed as a safe, fast-moving draft prospect, albeit one with a limited ceiling due to defensive limitations. Thaiss was exactly as advertised for the first two years of his pro career, and reached Double-A during his first full pro season though, as predicted, he hit for very little power, including a paltry .399 SLG% in the offensive paradise that is the Cal League.   In 2018, Thaiss added a more exaggerated leg kick and began lifting the ball more. A 45% ground ball rate at Double-A in 2017 turned into a 31% rate at Mobile the following year. He was eventually promoted to Triple-A Salt Lake and ended up with more 2018 homers (16) than he had had in his previous two years combined. Will the change be enough? It's going to be close. Thaiss posted a 102 wRC+ in 85 games as a 23-year-old at Triple-A; the big league average at first base last year was 105. We have him projected as a low-end regular there, which might make him a viable alternative to Justin Bour and Albert Pujols fairly soon.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2016, 1st (16) - LAA\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 30 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    Thaiss was the quintessential college performer when he was coming out of the University of Virginia, with his .473 on-base percentage as a junior particularly standing out. The Angels saw him as the most advanced college bat in the 2016 class and took him No. 16 overall. A catcher with the Cavaliers, he was moved to first so his bat could advance quickly, and it has, getting him to Triple-A after two-plus seasons of pro ball.    Thaiss still has a very advanced approach at the plate and has shown a willingness to draw walks and work deep counts. He was more of a contact-first hitter in his first full season, but in 2018, he started to drive the ball and tap into his power more effectively. While his walk rate did dip as a result of his efforts to generate more power, he set career highs in home runs, doubles, total bases and slugging percentage. Those efforts also didn't lead to more swing-and-miss, a good sign of things to come offensively.     Since moving out from behind the plate, Thaiss has worked tirelessly at first base and has become a capable defender there. The uptick in power makes him profile better at the corner infield position, and he's just about ready to contribute to a big league lineup.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"AAA\"","10","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.0\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","45","50","30","45","50","55","50","50","30","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","30","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["247","244","244","236","479","\"48.1\"","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.5\"","\"43.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Kevin\"","\"Smith\"","2019","\"22.9\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"188\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2039","675656","\"smith_kevin\"","","\"sa915864\"","\"|\"","","\"Maryland\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","45","\"JrOhd9zqQB0\"","","\"Smith was noticed early in his career at Maryland for showing early round tools as a defender who can stay in the middle infield with above average raw power and some feel to hit.

The Jays rave about Smith's makeup and preparation, and how he spearheaded the adjustments to his swing to have a shorter path to the ball and increase his contact ability. He now has a flatter-planed swing, and one scout compared his offense to Jordy Mercer, while another thinks Smith is a 50 hitter with 50 game power. Most scouts think he's fringy at shortstop despite a plus arm, and would shift him to second base long-term for the best fit, where he's got a chance to be above average. An 85 to 100 wRC+ with solid average defense at second base is worth 2-something WAR, so while it isn't sexy, there's some performance here, real changes to explain it, and a pretty good chance to be a 50 or 55 FV big leaguer.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2017, 4th (129) - TOR\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Smith jumped firmly onto the Draft radar with an outstanding performance in the 2016 Cape Cod League that led to an All-Star selection and playoff MVP honors. He didn't fare as well as a Maryland junior but still earned a third-round selection by Toronto in June and then had a promising debut. He spent the offseason reworking his swing and approach, and it paid immediate dividends in his first full season as he paced the Class A Midwest League in most offensive categories before moving up to high Class A Dunedin in late May. Although his production slowed a bit in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League, Smith still put together a monster season, finishing with a .302/.358/.528 line, 25 home runs, 31 doubles and 29 steals in 129 games.   Smith's offseason adjustments were centered on him eliminating a hole in his swing, and he showed a shorter, more leveraged path to the ball in 2018, with improved feel for keeping his barrel in the zone and driving the ball to all fields. Smith's plus raw power from the right side of the plate is for real, and he hits some of his most impressive home runs to the opposite field. Smith does have some swing-and-miss to his game, but it's a fair trade off given his ability to hit for both average and power. Smith's speed is only average, but he gets the most out of it on the basepaths, wisely picking his spots to steal and consistently getting good jumps.  Smith's offensive profile is only enhanced by his abilities at shortstop, where he's an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and plus arm strength. His defensive profile also fits well at third base, and Smith appeared in 27 games at the hot corner in 2018 on top of his usual reps up the middle. The Blue Jays rave about Smith's baseball IQ and work ethic, believing those qualities will allow him to always get the most out of his tools and surpass expectations.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AA\"","6","\"2017 Draft Rnd 4 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"50.0\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","55","50","40","55","50","50","55","50","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","50","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["248","245","195","424","30","\"48.1\"","\"47.9\"","\"44.3\"","\"55.3\"","\"51.2\"","\"55.6\"","\"|\"","\"Tyler\"","\"Phillips\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"191\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1598","663969","","","\"sa875646\"","\"|\"","","\"Bishop Eustace HS (NJ)\"","-1","1","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"SNd4V-aRCkE\"","","\"Phillips walked a minuscule 2.7% of opposing Low-A hitters in 2018, and did so as a 20-year-old just a few years removed from New Jersey high school ball.

He throws a lot of right-on-right changeups -- it's his best put away offering, and also helps induce grounders due to its sink.

He wasn't ready for full-season ball until 2017 and flunked his first test there with a 6.39 ERA in seven outings, but he fared well when he returned last year. He led the low Class A South Atlantic League with 11 wins and finished third in the Minors in K/BB ratio (7.9) and fourth in walk rate (1.1 per nine innings).  Phillips misses bats and generates a lot of groundouts thanks to the tail and sink on his fastball and changeup, and the downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-5 frame also helps. He has made impressive strides with his changeup, which grades as his best pitch, though his low-90s heater plays just as effectively because he commands it so well. He'll show the makings of a solid curveball but it's not as reliable as his other offerings.  While Phillips doesn't have sexy stuff, his ability to locate his pitches so well could make him a mid-rotation starter.

His defense was baptized by fire in the AZL as Naylor had to catch guys with huge stuff like Lenny Torres and Carlos Vargas, among others. If his offensive ability can withstand the developmental burdens and physical grind of catching, he could be a middle-of-the-order bat, too. Even if Naylor's in-game power manifests itself as doubles, he profiles at catcher and Cleveland's recent, brief experimentation with Francisco Mejia at third base provides some precedent for what may happen should Naylor prove unable to catch or if Cleveland thinks moving him will get his bat to the majors more quickly.\"","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","\"2018, 1st (29) - CLE\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  While Naylor (29th overall in 2018) didn't go as early in the first round of the Draft as his brother, Josh (12th overall to the Marlins in '15), he has a higher ceiling because he's a better pure hitter and much more athletic. He compiled an impressive amateur resume that includes MVP Awards with the Canadian junior national team in 2017 and '18, and a trip to the Junior Home Run Derby finals in '17. After Naylor signed for an above-slot $2,578,138, he performed as advertised in his pro debut.  One of the best pure hitters among high schoolers in the 2018 Draft, Naylor has a quick left-handed swing and advanced feel for the barrel. He controls the strike zone and uses the entire field, exhibiting no obvious shortcomings at the plate. While he focuses on making hard contact rather than worrying about home runs, his strength and hitting ability should translate into average or better power.  Naylor's considerable offensive upside presents a bit of a dilemma, because Cleveland's current plan to keep him at catcher will take a toll on his bat and add to the development time he'll need in the Minors. He's quicker than most backstops and has a solid arm, though he'll need to improve his throwing accuracy and bolster his receiving skills to stay behind the plate.

Wentz was 88-92 mph with solid average stuff and average command in 2018, and projects to improve when he has a full, healthy offseason to regain what he was the year before. He is also big and athletic with a smooth delivery and arm action, so there's the classic projection you're looking for. Like Muller, Wentz also has 70-grade raw power to provide offensive value when he reaches the big leagues. At its best, Wentz's fastball was 92-95, hitting 96 mph, and his curveball and changeup were plus, with multi-innings stretches when his command looked above average, which led some scouts to invoke Cole Hamels.

The Wentz train got slowed in 2018, not because of performance, but because he was bitten by the injury bug.  An oblique injury contributed to the left-hander being able to only make 16 starts in 2018. The good news is that he looked very much like the same pitcher he's always been when he was on the mound. Wentz has a three-pitch mix he uses well to keep hitters guessing. His fastball sits around 92-93 mph and can touch a bit higher, a pitch that plays up because he commands it and throws it with good life. Both of his secondary offerings, his changeup and curve, could be at least above-average pitches in the future. He could still stand to tighten his breaking ball a bit more. It has good shape to it, but making it a little sharper could help it become a true out pitch.  The southpaw also stands out because of his competitive nature, which can almost be a negative when he's too hard on himself.

He fouled a ball off his right foot and broke it last spring, costing him the final two months of his sophomore season and all of last summer. He has the best all-around tools in the 2019 college crop, though a rough spring in Southeastern Conference play leaves his Draft status somewhat uncertain.  Misner's bat speed, strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame give him huge raw power that he's just beginning to tap into.

He froze guess hitters for six weeks in Arizona, bisecting the plate with his changeup and slider, and changing eye levels with his curveball and fastball. That fastball, though, sits in the upper-80s and dipped down to 86 at times during his starts. It gives Yamamoto little margin for error with the pitch in the strike zone, and caps his ceiling well beneath that of some of the lower probability prospects in this system, which is why Yamamoto is down here even though we like him a lot. There are several potential outcomes here. Yamamoto could be a vanilla fifth starter, or he could fit into a Ryan Yarbrough kind of role as change of pace long reliever. He could be a junkballing reliever who kitchen sinks hitters for an inning at a time, or once through the lineup. The quality of the secondary stuff and Yamamoto's artistry should enable him to be something despite the lack of velocity, and he's on the 40-man now, so we may get to see it next year.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2014, 12th (356) - MIL\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  Part of a Saint Louis High (Honolulu) athletic program that has produced multiple big leaguers (Benny Agbayani, Brandon League, Chad Santos) and star quarterbacks (Marcus Mariota, Tua Tagovailoa), Yamamoto signed with the Brewers for $330,000 as a 12th-rounder in 2014. The least regarded of the four prospects the Marlins received in exchange for eventual National League MVP Christian Yelich in January 2018, he outperformed the other three -- Lewis Brinson, Monte Harrison and Isan Diaz -- in their first seasons in their new organization. After missing most of the first two months with shoulder issues, Yamamoto recorded a 1.83 ERA in 13 starts, advanced to Double-A and had a strong Arizona Fall League.  Undersized and not overpowering, Yamamoto compensates with a high spin rate that allows his 87-92 mph fastball to play better than its below-average velocity. His downer curveball has been a consistent plus pitch for him and he uses it extensively, sometimes throwing it with harder, shorter break. His fading changeup keeps hitters off his fastball and generates ground-ball contact.  Yamamoto doesn't have much margin for error and helps his cause by pounding the strike zone. If he can prove he's durable enough to hold up as a starter, he could eventually fit in the middle of Miami's rotation. The Marlins added him to their 40-man roster in November and he could help them in the near future.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"MLB\"","26","\"2014 Draft Rnd 12 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"54.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2700","50","45","50","55","50","","","55","45","55","60","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","60","","","","","55","","",""],["253","250","256","232","422","\"48.0\"","\"47.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.8\"","\"42.3\"","\"50.5\"","\"|\"","\"Jameson\"","\"Hannah\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"69\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2411","680683","\"hannah_jameson\"","","\"sa3007046\"","\"|\"","","\"Dallas Baptist\"","0","1","","\"Low\"","2021","45","\"3_oWB4aPvLQ\"","","\"Hannah had three remarkably consistent years at Dallas Baptist and ended his college career with a .340 average. He has excellent hitter's timing and bat control, and his swing is athletic but compact, enabling not only high rates of contact, but also promising contact quality. That's not to say Hannah will have in-game power. He's a line drive hitter, an old school, two-hole type of hitter, the kind who's sort of an endangered species in the current big league hitting environment. Some teams considered Hannah's lack of power to be a bit of an issue in their pre-draft evals and thought he was more of a tweener fourth outfield type, a projection echoed by pro scouts who saw Hannah in the summer and fall.   He has plus speed, speed that Hannah exhibited during instructional league even after he had been shut down for the summer with a foot injury. His frame is maxed out and he can't afford to slow down much and still be viable in center field every day, but while this creates some long term risk for his profile, he's fine out there right now.

The A's were very happy he lasted until the second round, the earliest the Patriots have had a hitter selected, and signed him for an above-pick value bonus of $1.8 million. He was able to show off some of his tools in the short-season New York-Penn League during his pro debut, but a foot injury shelved him for the summer in mid-July.  While he isn't the tallest guy in the world, he's strong and athletic and has a strong track record of consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate. He has an advanced approach, managing the strike zone well and finding the barrel while being very quick to the ball. His bat speed and strength point to some over-the-fence pop and plenty of extra-base power. He's shown he can handle wood just fine, both in a scorching hot stretch to end his Cape Cod season in 2017 and during his brief pro debut.   A plus runner, Hannah is an efficient baserunner with the potential to steal bases and cover a ton of ground in center field. He's a capable defender, albeit one with a fringy arm.

The limitation here is that Peterson has essentially never had a plus pitch and doesn't project to have one, working downhill from a steep plane and great extension with a low-90's sinker and an above-average four pitch mix. He doesn't have high spin rates on his breaking stuff and pitches more to weak contact, looking like a steady, durable, roughly league-average starter even as a college player. His feel to pitch and mix offerings in different locations is advanced, so the expectation here is for Peterson to save the Mets some money on that No. 3 or 4 starter that so many teams overpay for in free agency.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2017, 1st (20) - NYM\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 60 | Overall: 50  Peterson honored his commitment to Oregon rather than sign with the Red Sox out of high school as a 28th-round pick in 2014. Three years later, after a huge step forward during his junior season that included a 20-strikeout performance, Peterson landed in the first round, going to the Mets with the No. 20 overall pick, and signed for full pick value. After having his pro debut shortened by an ingrown toe nail and then beginning his first full season behind schedule due to a minor knee injury, Peterson breezed through the South Atlantic League, posting a 1.82 ERA in nine starts at Class A Columbia before advancing to the Class A Advanced Florida State League.  Peterson's fastball is average in terms of velocity, as he'll sit at 89-91 mph and touch 93, but few starters in the Minors can sink and command it as well as he does. Logging 127 1/3 innings in his first full season, Peterson yielded only two home runs (0.14 HR/9) and posted the third-best ground-ball rate (64.5%) in the Minors among qualified pitchers. He combines his heater with an above-average slider that nets him whiffs as an out pitch, while his changeup, which flashes above-average, gives him a weapon against right-handed hitters. He fills out his four-pitch mix with a fringy curveball that he can throw for a strike.  Despite a lower arm slot from his 6-foot-6 frame, Peterson has demonstrated outstanding control of all his pitches, even if he can stand to refine his overall command some. Average bat-missing ability and a knack for inducing weak, ground-ball contact points to more of a floor than a ceiling for Peterson, but it might not take him that long to reach his potential as a No. 3 or 4 starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"AA\"","6","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"52.9\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2250","45","50","50","45","50","","","55","50","55","45","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","45","60","","","","60","\"LAN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["255","252","306","369","478","\"47.9\"","\"46.3\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Roansy\"","\"Contreras\"","2019","\"19.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","3010","672710","","","\"sa3003020\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"y0x_qpio0cg\"","","\"Many of the teenage prospects on this list received big bonuses or were flagged after a season in the DSL as a prospect to watch; it's unsurprising when those types move up this list. Contreras wasn't one of those. He didn't appear on last year's list, which had 65 players in total -- he wasn't even in the Others of Note section. Contreras sits at 90-92 mph with an above average, flashing curveball, but was still in the early stages of knowing how to use those weapons while pitching in the DSL and GCL in 2017. We first heard his name when he was wowing pro scouts who saw him in Staten Island last summer. The first scout we spoke with said Contreras had a Luis Severino starter kit, flashing two plus pitches and a starter's delivery, though the changeup and command were understandably a bit behind. Those things progressed throughout the summer and he got a taste of Low-A at the end of the year. Yankees officials love Contreras' makeup and competitive fire, and think he's got a chance to be the 200-inning starter who comes out of this system, as the other pitchers on the list have one or more of the typical concerns (durability, command, arm surgery, less experience, or a standout pitch that fits best in relief).

Slick-fielding shortstop Jose Devers ($250,000) became part of the Giancarlo Stanton trade with the Marlins, while right-hander Yoendry Gomez ($50,000) has quality stuff and projectability. The best of the group is Contreras, who signed for $250,000 out of the Dominican Republic and reached low Class A last year at age 18.  Like many of the Yankees' best young pitching prospects, Contreras generates high spin rates on his fastball and breaking ball. His heater sat around 91 mph when he signed and now ranges from 93-97 with riding action up in the strike zone. He has nice feel for spinning a hard curveball with good shape and the potential to give him a second plus offering.   Contreras is also making progress with a fading changeup that will help him against left-handers. He repeats his delivery well and fills the strike zone.

He has made rapid progress since posting a 6.42 ERA in his U.S. debut in 2015, passing several more hyped Dodgers pitching prospects to make his big league debut last June. After beating the Rockies while getting knocked around in relief, he went on the disabled list with a strained rotator cuff and missed the rest of 2018.  Santana has plenty of velocity on his fastball, working at 93-95 mph and reaching 98, though it's even more notable for nasty sink that keeps it off barrels and creates a lot of groundouts. His hard slider can be a wipeout pitch at times and keeps right-handers at bay, though it's not as consistent as his fastball and sometimes looks more like a curveball. He has made progress with developing his changeup and had more success against left-handers last year than in the past.  Santana sometimes struggles to command his pitches because he has so much life on his fastball and utilizes a crossfire delivery. He does throw enough strikes for Los Angeles and most scouts to project him as a starter, with one organization rating him as the system's best prospect.

The industry was surprised when the Giants immediately sent Fox, who was a tantalizing athlete but an undercooked ballplayer, to full-season ball. He didn't play well, and was traded to Tampa Bay for Matt Moore a few minutes ahead of the 2016 trade deadline. When the Rays performed a post-swap physical on Fox, they discovered a bone bruise in his foot that would end his season, a matter the two clubs settled after the Rays initially sought further compensation. Fox repeated Low-A the following year and started to perform some with the bat. He's hit for high averages wth no power each of the last two years, and had a strong 2018 Fall League. The lack of power might prevent Fox from being a true average or better regular, and he remains inconsistent on defense, but he's a top of the scale athlete whose late 2018 showing could be a sign of real growth.

After an 18-month layoff from game action, he struggled during his pro debut at Class A Augusta and ultimately was traded to the Rays in the 2016 Deadline deal for Matt Moore. Fox was shut down for the season after the trade due to a foot injury that had plagued him all year, but he finally offered a glimpse of his potential in 2017, earning a selection to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game and finishing the season in the Florida State League. Fox hit .282, swiped 23 bags and finished fifth in on-base percentage (.371) during his return to the level in 2018 before a late bump to Double-A, followed by a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League.   Fox's athleticism and speed are among the best in the organization, and he has three other tools that should be at least solid. He's a switch-hitter who has the ingredients of a prototypical leadoff hitter with his advanced approach and knack for making line-drive contact from both sides of the plate. He's a better right-handed hitter (.341/.424/.417 in '18) than he is lefty (.238/.321/.309), but shows more raw power as the latter. Fox projects for well-below-average power overall, but he tallies his share of doubles and triples thanks largely to the 70-grade speed that also fuels his impact potential on the basepaths.  A true shortstop, Fox has the range, hands and above-average arm strength to remain at the position long-term. He lacks consistency at times and will appear a bit raw with some of his actions, but he's also capable of making electric, highlight-reel plays. The Rays are confident in his abilities there, viewing him as an above-average defensive shortstop when all is said and done.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AA\"","11","\"2015 J2 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"48.2\"","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","35","70","45","55","50","40","40","70","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","35","70","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["259","256","252","228","343","\"47.9\"","\"47.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.3\"","\"39.4\"","\"51.3\"","\"|\"","\"Cole\"","\"Roederer\"","2019","\"19.7\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2764","680711","","","\"sa3008184\"","\"|\"","","\"Hart HS (CA)\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2022","45","\"ohp5N8Ys_Ik\"","","\"As a high school underclassman, Roederer looked like a hit-first tweener outfielder.

He has already begun trading a little bit of contact for significantly more game power. With added mass and strength typically comes a reduction in straight line speed, but Roederer hasn't slowed down just yet and still looks like a possibility to stay in center, though most scouts who saw him in pro ball think he'll eventually move to left field. Regardless, there's a whole lot more bat here than there was on our pre-draft evaluation of Roederer, who has risen to the top of the promising teenage hitter group in this system because he has a chance to hit for average and power while the rest are likely to do just one of those.\"","\"|\"","","\"CHC\"","\"2018, 2C (77) - CHC\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Roederer drew comparisons to Andrew Benintendi but not the commensurate amount of Draft buzz as a California high school senior in 2018. An injury to his non-throwing shoulder and a strong commitment to UCLA clouded his status a bit and dropped him to the 77th overall pick, where he signed for an over-slot $1.2 million. He might have the highest offensive ceiling of any position player in the system.  Roederer added noticeable strength in 2018 and could become a .300 hitter with 25-homer power if everything comes together for him. He has advanced bat-to-ball skills, a disciplined approach and a quick left-handed swing that produces impressive exit velocities. He's presently a solid runner with the savvy to steal a few bases.  Some scouts wonder if Roederer will lose a half-step as he continues to mature physically, which could prompt a move from center field. The Cubs like his defensive instincts and his chances to remain in center. His arm may fit better in left field than in right if he has to shift to a corner, though he'd still fit the offensive profile at either spot.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","\"A\"","6","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.9\"","\"51.8\"","\"49.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","30","50","55","40","45","50","55","55","50","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TEX\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["260","257","253","229","315","\"47.9\"","\"47.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.6\"","\"38.1\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Everson\"","\"Pereira\"","2019","\"18.1\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"191\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1943","677592","","","\"sa3007034\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","45","","","\"Pereira was probably the least exciting of the three top prospects from the Yankees 2017 July 2nd haul, behind Raimfer Salinas and Antonio Cabello.

He is an above-average runner with an above-average arm and plus center field instincts, which makes him an above-average defender there. He'll likely grow into average raw power, but below-average game power due to a more gap-to-gap approach. Pereira has advanced feel to hit and held his own despite a higher strike out rate than expected in Pulaski as a 17-year-old, underlining the Yankees' confidence in his ability to make adjustments.

The most advanced of the group is Pereira, who signed for $1.5 million out of Venezuela. Not only did he come to the United States for his 2018 pro debut at age 17, he also skipped a level and held his own as the youngest regular in the Appalachian League, an advanced Rookie-level circuit.  Pereira couples all-around talent with advanced instincts. He uses a compact, quick right-handed stroke and impressive hand-eye coordination to lace line drives all over the field, and his 33-percent strikeout rate last year was more reflective of his youth than his future hitting ability. He has gotten stronger since signing and should develop close to average power.  Pereira has plus speed and presently uses it better in center field than on the bases.

That put Siani (as well as Alek Thomas and Jarred Kelenic) much further ahead of the notoriety/perceived polish curve than is typical for cold weather hitters. Siani isn't physically projectable and doesn't have big raw power, so he isn't the sexy upside high school player to whom clubs are drawn, but he does have a long track record of hitting and showing plus defensive ability in center field. He's a plus runner with a plus arm (90-92 on the mound) and gets great jumps on fly balls. There's a real chance Siani could have four tools that grade out as a 60, along with power that's a 45 or 50, and he's much closer to hitting that upside than most 19-year-olds.\"","\"|\"","","\"CIN\"","\"2018, 4th (109) - CIN\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50    Siani grew up in the greater Philadelphia area idolizing Mike Trout and has a chance to be a toolsy professional outfielder in his own right. A fourth-round pick in 2018, many amateur scouts had him as a potential first-rounder but some tinkering of his swing by an outside instructor, to go along with signability concerns, led to a fall. The Reds still gave him first-round type money ($2 million) to sign him away from his commitment from the University of Virginia.    An athletic kid who draws some comparisons to Grady Sizemore, Siani has drawn raves for having great instincts in the outfield, especially for a first-year professional who hails from a northern state. He didn't get the type of reps that players from the warmer states get, but is fundamentally sound in all aspects of his defense. Siani possesses an accurate arm that works behind the ball. He makes good reads and takes good routes and has a chance to be a well above-average defender. His speed should also make him a threat on the basepaths.    At the plate, there is still some ceiling for Siani's hitting with a balanced hitting approach to go along with compactness and directness with his left-handed swing. He could hit for average and have enough power to be interesting as a center fielder. If he grows in size and is moved to an outfield corner, he likely would profile as a fourth outfielder because he may lack the power normally seen from a regular corner outfielder.

Scott was his spitting image, with a lanky frame and a loose, gloveless lefty swing. Scott is a superior athlete to Tucker; he has been into the mid-90's on the mound, with three average or better pitches and 70 speed that profiles in center field. Scott doesn't appear to like pitching, so scouts haven't seen him throw much, but he's easily a prospect in the top five rounds on the hill. The Marlins popped Scott with the 13th pick and there was some disagreement in the industry about his projection. He had a number of minor injuries in the spring and only went to a couple showcases in the summer, so scouts have different reads on his hitting ability, though they agree he has a pretty swing and premium athleticism. Scott's lanky frame may not fill out much more, but scouts like his makeup and aren't worried about the swing-and-miss in his pro debut, as he was just getting an early taste of his 2019 assignment in Low-A.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2018, 1st (13) - MIA\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 65 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The latest standout from Plant High (Tampa), which produced Hall of Famer Wade Boggs and nine other big leaguers, Scott was the first outfielder taken in the first round by the Marlins since Christian Yelich in 2010. Club officials see some parallels between Yelich and Scott, who signed for $4,038,200 as the 13th overall pick in the 2018 Draft. Though he didn't post big numbers in his pro debut, Miami felt he was advanced enough to push to low Class A for the final month of the season.  Scott has the makings of a five-tool player and also draws comparisons to Bradley Zimmer. The Marlins felt Scott's left-handed swing was pretty polished for a high school hitter, though they would like to see him turn on more pitches and tap into his solid raw power after he used more of an opposite-field approach in his debut. He has a lofty offensive ceiling but will have to make more contact to reach it.  Scott has a funky running style yet has well above-average speed. He can go get the ball in center field and use his quickness to chase down balls from gap to gap.

His fastball and curveball project to plus pretty easily, and his arm speed/action are promising as far as changeup projection is concerned. His delivery resembles that of Triston McKenzie and it creates a tough-to-squaure, flat angle up in the zone that should allow Thomas to miss bats with his fastball.

Very much a raw project, he threw just 58 total innings in two pro summers before he was sent to the Pirates along with Erik Gonzalez in return for Jordan Luplow and Max Moroff.  At 6-foot-4, Thomas is an extremely athletic and projectable right-hander who has a long way to go before fulfilling his potential, considerable as it might be. His fastball in 2018 clocked in the 92-96 mph range with life up in the zone and it's much more control over command with it right now -- he's around the strike zone with it, but not putting it where he wants it at all times. His low-80s slider flashes plus with good biting action to it. He hasn't shown much of a changeup, showing one around 85-87 mph the few times he's thrown it, another area of focus as he moves forward.  Thomas is the epitome of a long-range project, but the feel for his stuff and his athleticism give him a chance to eventually get there as a starting pitcher. He'd be just the second Bahamian hurler to reach the big leagues and the first player of any sort from the country to get there since Antoan Richardson played briefly with the Yankees in 2014.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PIT\"","\"R\"","13","\"2016 J2 (CLE)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"55.8\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","2.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2350","45","55","40","50","","","","55","60","50","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","40","","55","","","","45","","",""],["264","261","337","366","728","\"47.8\"","\"45.9\"","\"45.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"47.3\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Christin\"","\"Stewart\"","2019","\"25.5\"","\"DH\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","180","4","\"|\"","1293","621514","\"stewart_christin\"","17714","\"sa858826\"","\"|\"","","\"Tennessee\"","0","2","","\"Med\"","2019","45","\"vl86vfpaV3Y\"","","\"Stewart has now hit for big power and walked at an above-average clip for five consecutive years, dating back to his junior season at Tennessee.

Stewart will most certainly give back some value on defense as he's not a good defensive outfielder and probably belongs at DH. The predicament in Detroit is that so too do many of their other hitters, even though Victor Martinez has retired. And so Stewart will likely slowly prowl left field early in his career, and perhaps move to DH once Miguel Cabrera and Nick Castellanos move on. He's already 25, so while we think Stewart will hit like a good team's 4-, 5- or 6-hole hitter for a while, this type of profile typically doesn't age well, which, along with the defensive limitations, had us round down our projections a little bit.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"MLB\"","6","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (DET)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"47.3\"","\"48.2\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","55","65","40","30","40","45","60","65","40","30","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["265","262","338","222","867","\"47.8\"","\"45.9\"","\"46.4\"","\"47.1\"","\"35.8\"","\"48.1\"","\"|\"","\"Brooks\"","\"Lee\"","2019","\"18.3\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"180\"","\"draft\"","180","4","\"|\"","2843","","\"lee_brooks\"","","","\"|\"","","\"San Luis Obispo HS\"","1","1","","","","45","","\"Flashy SS with above-average bat speed, limited feel to hit.\"","\"Lee is a flashy shortstop defender with good bat speed.

Lee's Draft stock took a big jump over the summer, particularly with his performance at the Area Code Games, and he's continued to be a solid performer this spring.  A switch-hitter, Lee has worked hard on getting his right-handed hitting up to the same level as his more natural left side. He doesn't have the prettiest swing in the world -- it's steep and he can come off the ball too quickly -- but his hand-eye coordination is so good that he doesn't swing and miss much, with some seeing a future plus hitter. He can turn around premium velocity with ease and while he doesn't have a ton of power now, there is some strength in his swing. Defensively, Lee has outstanding hands and a strong arm and his instincts allow him to get to balls he shouldn't be able to based on his below-average speed.  Because of those skills and his high baseball IQ, Lee will likely get sent out as a shortstop at the start of his pro career, though some see a move to second in the future.

Though Hudson has ascended rapidly through the minors, concerns about his ability to throw strikes have proved prescient, as he has posted slightly worse-than-average walk rates as a pro, and twice the average starter's rate in his short big league stint. Throw in the redundant shape and utility of Hudson's secondary pitches, now limited to a low-90s cutter and mid-80s slider that belnd together in the upper-80s, and there's a strong chance he ends up a late-innign reliever instead of a long-term starter.

It's an approach that's typically shiftable, but Gonzalez is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this. Like Rutherford ahead of him, it's tough to project corner outfielders with middling power as average or better regulars.

His immediate success against full-season competition caught the Padres' attention, and they acquired him for Drew Pomeranz during the 2016 All-Star break. But Espinoza's 2017 season was over before it began, as he opened the year on the disabled list with right forearm tightness before undergoing Tommy John surgery in August. He had worked his way back and seemed poised to return in earnest early in the 2019 season before it was announced that he underwent a second Tommy John surgery in April.   Though he may be small in stature, there's nothing diminutive about Espinoza's stuff when healthy. His smooth delivery and lightning-quick arm produce a heater that can touch triple digits, though he typically works in the 94-95 mph range with late movement. Espinoza's curveball shows plus potential but lacks consistency at times in 2016, while his changeup, thrown with fastball-like arm action as well as considerable sink, gives him a true chance for three plus pitches. Beyond the stuff, Espinoza repeats his mechanics well and demonstrates advanced control and command for a hurler his age.  With Espinoza's second TJ surgery comes yet another setback in his once promising career. He'll still be 22 when he returns in 2020, but he also hasn't thrown a competitive pitch since '16, and has never pitched above the Class A level. On top of that, the right-hander will forever face questions about his durability, and it's only to fair to wonder whether he might be ticketed for a bullpen role upon his return.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","21","\"2014 J2 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"52.5\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.1667","1.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2750","40","55","50","50","","","","45","60","60","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","60","55","","","","","50","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["269","266","242","224","566","\"47.8\"","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.0\"","\"47.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"|\"","\"Sean\"","\"Reid-Foley\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","764","656887","\"reid-foley_sean\"","17034","\"sa828690\"","\"|\"","","\"Sandalwood HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","45","\"iVpbxreVa9Q\"","","\"Reid-Foley has been a similar pitcher from his junior year of high school all the way to his fifth year of pro ball in 2018.

The Jays will continue to run him out there as a starter -- he made 31 starts and threw 163 innings last season across three levels -- but most agree this is more of a multi-inning or high-leverage reliever, as opposed to a traditional starter. The pure stuff would fit any role on a staff, but the quality of the strikes (his command) is the issue, rather than the amount of strikes (his control), which was evident from his 5.13 ERA in his major league debut in 2018.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2014, 2nd (49) - TOR\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  Reid-Foley had some first-round buzz ahead of the 2014 Draft but ultimately fell to the Blue Jays in the second round, where he signed for $1,128,000, spurning a Florida State commitment. He made strides in his second full season, splitting the year between Class A Lansing and Class A Advanced Dunedin before a balky right elbow prompted the Blue Jays to shut him down in August. Advancing to Double-A the next year, Reid-Foley was healthy from start to finish but struggled to command his fastball, leading to uneven results. He dominated over eight starts in his return to Eastern League in 2018, earning a Triple-A promotion in May and his first big league callup in August at age 22. He would make seven starts for Toronto down the stretch, recording a pair of 10-strikeout performances along the way.   Reid-Foley was less aggressive and consistent with his heater in 2017, so the Blue Jays made it a major point of focus for him in '18. As a big leaguer, his fastball was up to 97 mph and averaged 94, with sinking action and arm-side run that helped him miss bats and avoid barrels. Reid-Foley's above-average slider in the mid-80s has long been considered his best secondary pitch, and the curveball he added in 2016 shows at least average potential. His firm changeup, once fully developed, could be another quality offering.   Reid-Foley's deceptive delivery and arm action make him particularly tough on right-handed hitters, and they hit just .221/.312/.342 with a 29 percent strikeout rate against him across three levels in 2018. Improvements to his below-average control and fringey changeup should make him more effective against lefties and go a long way in terms of helping him become a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AAA\"","5","\"2014 Draft Rnd 2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.6\"","\"50.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2100","45","55","45","50","55","","","45","60","50","50","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","50","55","","","","45","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["270","267","221","225","281","\"47.8\"","\"47.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.8\"","\"43.4\"","\"51.5\"","\"|\"","\"Jack\"","\"Leiter\"","2019","\"19.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","180","4","\"|\"","2839","","\"leiter_jack\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Delbarton HS\"","0","0","","","","45","","\"Al's son.

It's been evident in the polish he's shown as a New Jersey high school standout on the last summer's showcase circuit, for Team USA and then again this spring on a big stage at USA Baseball's National High School Invitational.  From a velocity standpoint, Leiter often utilizes an average fastball, thrown in the 91-92 mph range, though he can go get 94-95 mph when he needs it. It plays up because he throws it with some sink and has outstanding command of the pitch. He has shown distinct breaking balls in the past, though he's been leaning on the curve more frequently this spring, and it was a true knee-buckling out pitch during his NHSI win. He has feel for a solid changeup as well, even if he doesn't need it much at his current level.  Leiter is much more advanced than most high schoolers in terms of his feel for pitching and command, he presents himself more like a polished college starter. There isn't much projection in his frame, reminding some of a Mike Leake type, with slightly better stuff.

Sometimes those players fill out too much to stay at shortstop, and end up as power-hitting third basemen; sometimes they don't, and become starting shortstops with modest offensive ability. And sometimes, they develop in the Goldilocks Zone, stay at short, and make a big offensive impact. That last outcome's existence, unlikely as it may be, puts prospects like Javier in a kind of rarified air, even when they haven't yet done anything, and Javier hasn't.   When should we start to worry about all the injuries? Since signing in 2015, Javier has played in just 50 games while dealing with various maladies. He was in street clothes during part of 2015 instructs for reasons unknown to us, he played in just nine games in 2016 due to a hamstring strain, was healthy in 2017, then missed all of 2018 with a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder. This spring, he strained his quad and did not break camp with an affiliate. His frame has filled out and looked explosive, and during the spring, he was noticeably stronger and more powerful than he was when he signed. Javier's body, bat speed, swing foundation, and defensive fit is the stuff of stardom, but we have little-to-no data on important things like plate discipline and feel for contact, and the injury history has been troubling. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - MIN\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  There was obvious excitement when the Twins aggressively pursued Javier, one of the top prospects in the 2015-16 international class, and signed him for $4 million in July 2015. Since then, however, there have only been glimpses of what he can do. The talented infielder missed most of his first summer, in 2016, because of a hamstring injury, then re-set a high bar by being one of the best prospects in the Appalachian League in his United States debut in 2017. Momentum was halted when a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder kept him off the field for all of 2018.  Because the injuries have limited his time on the field, Javier is a bit of a wild card. Once he can shake the rust off, there is confidence he'll once again show his considerable offensive upside. He makes consistent hard contact with a natural feel to hit and while as a young player without that many reps, he'll need to refine his approach. He does work counts and draw walks. As he fills out, his bat speed and potential plus hitting tool could lead to at least average power. Fortunately, Javier's injury wasn't to his throwing shoulder, so his plus arm should be just fine. Whether he outgrows the position remains to be seen.  With a clean bill of health and no setbacks from his injury, Javier should be ready to show what he can do over the course of a long season. Getting at-bats and reps in the field is priority number one for now.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"A\"","5","\"2015 J2 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.9\"","\"50.9\"","\"49.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","45","55","45","60","50","45","55","50","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TOR\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["272","269","192","226","140","\"47.8\"","\"48.0\"","\"46.4\"","\"52.5\"","\"43.8\"","\"53.3\"","\"|\"","\"Nick\"","\"Pratto\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2082","668472","\"pratto_nick\"","","\"sa3004138\"","\"|\"","","\"Huntington Beach HS (CA)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"m12VQ7FD72k\"","","\"Pratto went from two-way duty as a high school senior, to Low-A teenager in his first full pro season, and he performed admirably.

He also stole a surprising 22 bases, but based on how thick and muscular he looked during 2019 spring training, that seems unlikely to continue.   Some of the pre-draft notions that Pratto had elite plate discipline (part of why he generated some irresponsible Joey Votto comps at the time) seem false now that we have a larger sample of data to look at. It makes it more important that Pratto get to all his power so he can profile at first, something made even more imperative by his mediocre, early-career contact rates.

He was also a teammate of 2017 second-round pick Hagen Danner, now with the Blue Jays, and a frequent member of USA Baseball national teams winning gold medals. As a senior, his bat jumped ahead of his arm and the Royals took him in the middle of the first round to hit and he did just that in his first full year, finishing with 14 homers and 22 steals.    While Pratto struggled out of the gate in the South Atlantic League, he showed just why he was considered one of the best high school bats in the 2017 Draft class with a .322/.394/.518 line in the second half. He has a solid overall approach at the plate and can drive the ball to all fields, but there was more swing and miss to his game than some anticipated, though that did improve in his strong finish to the 2018 season. He started tapping into his left-handed power more, with the chance to grow into even more as he matures and refines his approach.     While Pratto has fringy speed, he might be the most instinctive baserunner in the system, allowing him to be aggressive on the basepaths. His athleticism also plays well at first with excellent defensive tools, including a plus arm that used to fire upper-80s fastballs from the mound.

He saw some action in the outfield in 2018, when he ranked second among NCAA Division I freshmen in strikeouts (97 in 72 innings). He opened this season with six no-hit innings against a loaded Stanford lineup and quickly established himself as the top age-eligible sophomore pitcher in the 2019 Draft.    Pound for pound, Jameson may have the best fastball in the Draft. Listed at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he has a lightning-quick arm that allows him to deal at 93-96 mph and top out at 98 deep into games. The Mid-American conference pitcher of the year backs up his heat with a pair of hard breaking balls, a curveball with depth and a slider with more lateral break, and each can be a plus pitch at times.    Jameson also has a changeup, though it's a bit firm and he doesn't use if very often. Though he has dominated as a full-time starter this spring, scouts worry that he's not big enough to handle the grind of taking the mound every five days in pro ball.

Lugo's bat is what has stood out the most, especially over the summer and at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He has an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, with a line-drive, up-the-middle philosophy. While he's not nearly as big as Correa, Lugo looks the part already and has more pop from the right side of the plate than you might expect, with some feeling he could have better than average power in the future. While he's not a burner, he runs well underway and is a solid athlete.  The Carlos Beltran Academy product gets some mixed reviews defensively.

He didn't pitch much in pro ball or instructs as Toronto was managing his innings and getting him used to the pro schedule.

That was confirmed during the first two days of the 2018 Draft, as the Blue Jays selected Groshans with their first-round pick and then signed him for below slot to save money for the TCU-committed Kloffenstein, who signed for $2.45 million -- well above his slot's recommended value of $652,900 -- after being taken in the third round. He made his pro debut alongside Groshans in the Rookie Gulf Coast League.   Kloffenstein can work in the low 90s with heavy sink on his two-seam fastball and reach back for 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has advanced feel for a breaking ball, showing the ability to morph his sharp slider, which flashes above-average potential, into a bigger-breaking curveball or a harder cutter.

He had Tommy John surgery in high school, dealt with a torn meniscus and broken hand in college at Pittsburgh and had labrum surgery on his shoulder after signing as a seventh-rounder in 2011, so he didn't make his pro debut until 2014. He missed time with lat issues (2015), back spasms and bones spurs in his elbow (2016) and more bone spurs that led to his release in April 2017 before the Giants re-signed him that August.  Black's fastball achieved legendary status in the Minors, where he once reached 104 mph and could sit at 100 when healthy. At the same time, he often fell into the trap of trying to light up radar guns and would overthrow, losing any hope of finding the strike zone with consistency. He found more success and strikes in 2018 when he dialed his heater down to 96-99 mph, where it still features high spin rates.  There's no finesse with Black, who comes after hitters with his fastball and a tight mid-80s slider that has some bite but also can get slurvy if he doesn't stay on top of it. Once he figured out that he could still overpower hitters without maximizing his velocity and effort, his control and confidence took off.

He's been throwing bullpens and is on track to return sometime in the middle of 2019. It's unclear if the drop in velocity De Leon exhibited betwixt his DL stints was due to injury or if that's just how hard he throws now. At his prospect peak in Los Angeles, when De Leon struck out no fewer than 32% of opposing hitters over a three-season stretch, he was sitting 92-94, and touching 96. Though there's less stigma surrounding drop-and-drive deliveries now, there was concern about De Leon's fastball being liftable even at that velocity due to it's plane. At his more recent 89-91, it's more worrisome. But if the velocity comes back, De Leon will have two plus pitches in his fastball and a goofy changeup, which has weird, horizontal action. He throws a ton of strikes and has two viable breaking balls. He could be a No. 3 or 4 starter if everything comes back, but is more like a No. 5 if it doesn't.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AAA\"","23","\"2013 Draft Rnd 24 (LA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"52.9\"","","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2500","50","45","60","50","45","","","55","50","60","50","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["278","275","422","790","139","\"47.6\"","\"45.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"52.5\"","\"50.2\"","\"52.7\"","\"|\"","\"Joel\"","\"Kuhnel\"","2019","\"24.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"260\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","3056","669270","","","\"sa918205\"","\"|\"","","\"Texas-Arlington\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","\"UZJWHb5SDAQ\"","","\"Kuhnel wasn't a top draft prospect coming out of Texas-Arlington: he had a maxed-out, bulky frame, inconsistent command, and just average stuff for a right-handed reliever.

The 6-foot-4 hurler has the body and potential repertoire to a solid starting pitcher.

A swing change after the 2016 season altered his style of hitting pretty drastically, and Kramer has taken on a more proactive approach since making those mechanical alterations (his hands were loading lower, for one), and he's also hitting for more power.

For the first two years of his pro career, Kramer used a contact-oriented approach to rise up to the upper levels of the system. He started tapping into his extra-base thump in 2017 before he got hurt and leveraged his swing more to clear more fences in '18. With that came more strikeouts, but that's not something the Pirates see as a huge red flag. Kramer does need to work on his game plan more, as he does tend to guess at the plate too much. While he's played all three infield positions, he'll continue to see most of his playing time at second base, though he's fine at third with an arm that's bounced back to average.  While still in the Minors, he'd have to play second over the hot corner in deference to the other top pick from 2015, Ke'Bryan Hayes, who was the high schooler taken between Newman and Kramer.

His mother was a track and field athlete at the University of Washington and his father is former NBA All-Star, Reggie Theus. In addition to his athletic gifts, scouts rave about Davis' maturity as a student and a worker (often citing the odd hours he keeps taking care of a goat and llamas at his family home), and all thought he'd be able to cope with likely early-career contact struggles and would work to improve his ability to hit.

One of the best athletes in the 2018 Draft, he battled hamstring injuries during his senior season but still went in the second round and signed for $1.1 million.  Though Davis' right-handed swing and pitch recognition still need refinement, he has the tools to become a 30-30 player if he hits. With his bat speed and the leverage and projectable strength in his 6-foot-4 frame, he can punish the ball when he connects. He's also a well above-average runner who should wreak havoc on the bases once he hones his instincts.  With his quickness, Davis should have little trouble staying in center field, though he still needs to refine his reads and routes.

As the summer wore on, Seigler grew on scouts, was chosen as the backup catcher for Team USA, and quickly took the starting job from eventual Marlins second rounder Will Banfield. Seigler was able to do this (and eventually become a first round pick) due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. In addition to solid contact skills, Seigler also started to lift the ball in games closer to the draft and get to all of his fringy raw power. This polish helped to make teams less worried about his advanced age relative to his prep peers, and some scouts thought he was among the top 5-10 players in the entire draft.   Seigler had a solid pro debut that was in line with the expectations of any of the pro scouts we talked to who watched the Yankees' GCL club. He's an average runner and an above-average athlete for the position, projecting as an above-average defender with a 65-grade arm. Some clubs don't like the recent track record of prep catchers and considered taking Seigler and then moving him to third base, but his feel for catching is too advanced to throw away. There are some similarities to another prep catcher from the prior draft: M.J. Melendez of the Royals. Melendez is a little twitchier while Seigler is a little more advanced in terms of skills. Seigler's mother is Navajo and he would be the first Native American big leaguer to debut since Joba Chamberlain and the second ever from the Navajo Nation, joining Jacoby Ellsbury.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","\"2018, 1st (23) - NYY\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 45 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Seigler's notoriety as a switch-hitter and switch-pitcher who could throw in the upper 80s with equal effectiveness with either arm sometimes overshadowed the fact that he was one of the best catchers in the 2018 Draft. New York made him the first prep backstop selected, signing him for $2,815,900 as the 23rd overall pick. If he reaches the big leagues, he'll join Jacoby Ellsbury as the only members of the Navajo Nation to do so.  The Yankees often prioritize slugging over hitting ability and defense at catcher, but Seigler doesn't fit their usual profile. He's extremely athletic for his position and could develop into a Gold Glover behind the plate. He has promising receiving and framing potential, and his plus arm plays even better because he has such a quick transfer.  A proficient hitter from both sides of the plate, Seigler controls the strike zone and drills line drives to all fields. He has a contact-oriented approach with solid bat speed, and while he's not loaded with raw power, he has the hitting ability to get the most out of what he has.

The switch-hitting speedster opened his career in the Rookie-level Arizona League, where he notched a .384 average and a .471 on-base percentage in his first 21 professional games. He earned a promotion to Low-A Tri-City, and his numbers remained steady. It was a thoroughly impressive debut season for Edwards, who doesn't own much power, but shined with every other tool.  Edwards is a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, but his skill set makes that easy to overlook. He stands out most for his speed, an easy plus-plus tool that can legitimately impact games. At the plate, Edwards uses all fields well, and he owns an advanced knowledge of the strike zone. While he's not likely to be a home run threat, he could grow into his frame for more extra-base pop with an Eric Young-type build. He has excellent actions and footwork at shortstop and has shown he has enough arm to stay on the left side of the infield.  With a combination of a mature approach, strong contact skills from both sides of the plate and nearly elite speed, Edwards has all the requisite tools to hit atop a lineup for a long time. An ability to stick up the middle adds even more value to his profile and gives him a realistic Major League floor to go along with a high ceiling.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A\"","11","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"36.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","20","40","80","50","45","55","30","45","80","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","70","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"LAA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["285","282","312","421","303","\"47.5\"","\"46.2\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.7\"","\"45.0\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"Hunter\"","\"Barco\"","2019","\"18.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"76\"","\"212\"","\"draft\"","171","4","\"|\"","2840","","\"barco_hunter\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Bolles HS\"","1","0","","","","42","","\"Low-slot lefty who has freakishly low split/changeup spin rates (which is good), great frame.

He was shut down late in the season with a shoulder muscle strain but hit 96 mph in a private workout with Milwaukee, so the health scare looks to be behind him.

He was a bit inconsistent last summer, and then was pitching better for his Jacksonville area high school to put an up arrow next to his name. A mild shoulder strain that shelved him for a while did put a damper on his spring.    The 6-foot-4 southpaw has the ideal pitcher's body, with room to fill out and see his stuff tick upward, especially once he stops being a two-way player. His velocity fluctuated over the summer, but was up to 94 mph this spring with good arm-side movement. He'll flash an excellent slider, though he can get underneath it at times, impacting it's consistency, and he has good feel for an above-average changeup as well. While he was stronger this spring, Barco still throws from a lower slot than some scouts would like. He struggles repeating his release point, which can lead to command issues.    That arm slot does create deception in his delivery, though, often making him tough to hit. Teams willing to take him early and sign him away from his University of Florida commitment would have to believe there's more in the tank and that they can work with the lefty to clean up his delivery once he becomes a pro. But he was shut down for a period of time leading up to the Draft, leading many to believe he could end up heading to Florida.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","42","718","\"NYM\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.2\"","\"52.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","45","55","","45","","","50","50","65","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","","55","","","","50","","",""],["286","283","286","284","599","\"47.5\"","\"46.6\"","\"45.7\"","\"48.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","\"Corey\"","\"Ray\"","2019","\"24.7\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","268","6","\"|\"","1642","641999","\"ray_corey\"","","\"sa738510\"","\"|\"","","\"Louisville\"","2","0","","\"High\"","2019","42","\"9NBoNbU7Zy8\"","\"Ray got to more power last year but the swing and miss stuff is still a concern.\"","\"Despite his notable 2018 statistical output -- 66 extra base hits, including 27 home runs, and 37 steals on 44 attempts at Double-A Biloxi -- we're still somewhat apprehensive about Ray and have him graded out exactly as we did last offseason, when he was coming off a terrible statistical campaign. Ray, long lauded for his makeup, made some adjustments to remedy the timing issues that plagued him in 2017. His front hip is clearing earlier, enabling him to catch some of the inside pitches that were tying him up last year. This has seemed to improve the quality of Ray's contact, but it hasn't remedied his strikeout issues. Ray struck out in 29.3% of his 2018 plate appearances and had a 17.5% swinging strike rate, the latter of which would rank as the 15th most frequent SwStr% in the majors last year. Ray swings through pitches in the zone fairly frequently and despite his prodigious physical abilities, his offensive profile feels unstable. His up-the-middle defensive profile gives him some wiggle room on offense, but he's not a very instinctive defender and is closer to average in center field than one might expect given his speed. Players can succeed despite heavy strikeouts; Chris Taylor's skillset looks an awful lot like Ray's (power, strikeouts, and a pedestrian defense at a premium position) and Taylor was a 3 WAR player last year. Ray's peak could look like that. He's also similar to players like Franchy Cordero, Brad Zimmer, late-career Colby Rasmus, and an even longer list of hitters who also have lean years when they don't hit and produce closer to replacement level. We expect peaks and valleys over the course of a long career from Ray.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2016, 1st (5) - MIL\"","","2019","55","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  After a breakout campaign as a Louisville sophomore that he followed with a strong performance for the U.S. collegiate national team, Ray solidified his status as a future first-round pick by hitting 15 homers and swiping 44 bags as a junior. The Brewers made him the fifth overall pick that June, and Ray signed for $4.125 million, the largest bonus in club history. Knee surgery delayed the start of Ray's pro debut, and he never looked right upon returning, hitting for neither average nor power while spending the entire season in the High A Carolina League. Challenged with a Double-A Biloxi assignment in 2018, Ray finally looked like the player the Brewers had drafted, hitting 27 home runs and swiping 37 bags en route to honors as the Southern League's Most Outstanding Player.  Ray's power-speed combo is among the best in the Minors. It didn't show in his first full season because Ray struggled to control the strike zone, often chasing pitches well out of the zone with a lengthy swing that produced a Carolina League-high 156 strikeouts. With an emphasis on picking specific pitches to hit in 2018, Ray regained his confidence at the plate and returned to his strengths, showing above-average game power and feel for using the entire field. He still struck out quite a bit and finished second in the Southern League with 176 whiffs, but the overall quality of his contact, as well as the results, were markedly better. A plus runner, Ray's 37 steals were an improvement over the 24 in his pro debut, and he's a candidate to steal 30 bags at the highest level.  Ray's wheels also serve him well in center field, where he's an above-average defender with at least average arm strength. Strikeouts will always be a concern with Ray, but his combination of strong game power, speed and defense should ultimately help to offset concerns about his low batting averages. Overall, it's the profile of potential above-average everyday player, with a fourth-outfielder floor.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AAA\"","7","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","2","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"43.6\"","\"49.1\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","30","45","60","70","40","40","40","50","60","70","45","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","60","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["287","284","287","213","677","\"47.5\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.4\"","\"48.4\"","\"40.3\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","\"Will\"","\"Wilson\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"175\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2827","","\"wilson_will\"","","","\"|\"","","\"North Carolina State\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2022","45","","\"Wilson is a hyper-productive, medium-framed middle infielder with solid average tools and advanced feel for the game.

Though he's not physically imposing, Wilson has quick hands and deceptive strength that give him at least above-average raw power. A right-handed hitter, he has a knack for putting the barrel on the ball. He shows the ability to hit for average and power, and he has done a better job of drawing walks this spring despite his aggressive approach.  The biggest knock on Wilson is his below-average speed. Most big league shortstops run better than that, though some scouts think he can stay at the position because he has quick actions and hands.

In college, McCarthy missed several weeks of his junior year due to back surgery, and in 2018, he had back issues again, which cost him several months. His Fall League stint ended prematurely due to a fractured hand. Amid these injuries, McCarthy has reached base at .390 career rate and climbed to Triple-A Durham. He has sufficient physical tools to hit, just not for stardom, and we expect him to be a role playing 1B/OF who yields value on par with a low-end regular, assuming he can stay healthy.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2015, 5th (148) - TB\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 45 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  McCarthy had back surgery after his sophomore year at Virginia and appeared in just 33 games as junior in 2015, when the Cavaliers won a College World Series title. The Rays, believing in McCarthy's impressive, pre-surgery track record at the plate, made him their fifth-round pick that June, and he rewarded them with a relatively quick rise through the Minors. He turned his best offensive season at Double-A Montgomery in 2017 and finished among the Southern League leaders in a host of offensive categories. Opening the following year in Triple-A, McCarthy looked like a candidate to contribute in the Majors until a back injury in late May landed him on the injury list for nearly three months. A broken hand cut his Arizona Fall League campaign short and kept him from making up for lost time, but the Rays still added him to their 40-man roster after the season.   McCarthy is a pure hitter who controls the strike zone well, excels at getting on base and has the strength and leverage to produce above-average left-handed power. He's still learning how to incorporate his lower-half strength into his swing and turn on pitches, and club officials expect many of his doubles and triples to begin to clear the fence once that's in place. Formerly an above-average runner, McCarthy's back injury has robbed him of much of that speed, though he still moves well enough to effectively play left field, where his below-average arm is a fit, and has proved a capable first baseman in the past.   McCarthy gets the most out of his tools, and it's those intangibles that have the Rays believing he can at least carve out a role as a bench bat who offers value with his on-base skills and double-digit home-run totals. He still has the potential to develop into a second-division regular, though projecting him in such a role is complicated by his checkered medical history.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AAA\"","16","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"48.2\"","\"51.8\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","40","55","40","50","50","55","50","55","40","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","45","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["289","286","277","214","529","\"47.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.2\"","\"37.9\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Calvin\"","\"Mitchell\"","2019","\"20.2\"","\"LF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"209\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2002","668751","\"mitchell_calvin\"","","\"sa3004258\"","\"|\"","","\"Rancho Bernardo HS (CA)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2021","45","\"yal8ZxNmuHI\"","","\"Mitchell's lack of defensive ability played a huge role in pushing him down into the middle of the second round of the 2017 draft. He projects defensively to left field or perhaps even to first base, which leaves no margin for error for his bat. So far, Mitchell has hit. As a 19-year-old at Low-A, Mitchell slashed .280/.344/.427. He has really quick, loose hands in the box and he can move the barrel all over the place. His bat head drags through the hitting zone a bit, which can make it tough for him to pull pitches he should be crushing, but it also leads to some very pretty opposite field doubles.   Because Mitchell's frame is fairly squat, it's unlikely that he grows into huge raw power. As such he'll probably have to develop a special hit tool to profile at the defensive positions he's capable of playing. He's off to a strong start in that regard.\"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","\"2017, 2nd (50) - PIT\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 45 | Arm: 45 | Field: 45 | Overall: 50  Hailing from the baseball powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School in the San Diego area, Mitchell entered his senior season as one of the better pure bats in the prep class. He struggled that spring and slid to the second round of the 2017 Draft. While he definitely hit the proverbial wall during his first full season of pro ball, overall he's looked very much like the advanced bat the Pirates hoped was still in there when they selected him.  A South Atlantic League All-Star in 2018, Mitchell has an innate ability to barrel the ball in the strike zone, with an approach that gives him the chance to be a plus hitter in the future. The Pirates would like to see him impact the ball a bit more, and while some power did show up in his first full year, there might be more in there with a high percentage of line drives and fly balls a good indicator of what's to come in the future as he gets stronger. Added strength and better knowledge of what it takes to play a full season should help Mitchell offset the fatigue he felt at the end of '18.  The bat is going to have to play because of his fringe-average defense. Both his speed and his arm are scraping average, meaning he's likely destined for left (though right field would be a fit in PNC Park).

The D-backs, who had drafted the left-hander the year prior, brought him into the fold at the 2014 Trade Deadline in the Gerardo Parra deal. A strong 2016 season raised expectations for 2017, but while Banda did make his big league debut, he had a tough year overall before Tampa Bay acquired him as part of a three-team trade with the Yankees in February. After a solid start to Banda's season between Triple-A and the Majors, it was announced in early June that the lefty would require Tommy John surgery.  Banda had trouble finding a rhythm during the 2017 season as he rode the Reno-Arizona shuttle at times, often getting thrown from his routine. That did not help him learn to deal with the struggles he faced, both in the tough pitching environment of Reno and in the big leagues. There's still a lot to like about Banda's stuff, though, starting with a fastball that was up to 97 mph pitching in relief at the end of the year. He could settle into the 93-95 mph range when all is said and done. His curveball flashes plus, but it was inconsistent at times last year, and he has good enough feel for his changeup to envision it eventually being consistently average.  While Banda remained around the strike zone, his command within it suffered, making him much too hittable. He's still young enough to reach his potential as a mid-rotation starter, though, as Banda will be in his age-25 season when he returns to the mound in mid-2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"MLB\"","18","\"2012 Draft Rnd 10 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","21","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","1850","40","55","50","40","50","","","45","55","55","45","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","45","50","","","","50","\"LAN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["293","290","311","532","126","\"47.4\"","\"46.2\"","\"42.9\"","\"52.7\"","\"49.8\"","\"53.0\"","\"|\"","\"Erik\"","\"Swanson\"","2019","\"25.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"235\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2739","657024","","16587","\"sa829145\"","\"|\"","","\"Iowa Western JC (IA)\"","0","1","","\"Low\"","2019","42","\"9-gldlB-QhQ\"","","\"Swanson's fastball exhibits several of the nuanced traits that aid velocity in missing bats. For one, his heater has a 12:30 spin axis, which means it has nearly perfect backspin, better enabling fastball rise. It also has an approach angle that plays well at the top of the strike zone, which, in combination with the rise and velocity, makes it the archetypal modern fastball. His secondary stuff is quite average but as long as he is locating his mid-80s slider and changeup -- something he has struggled with in his big league appearances this spring -- he should at least be a good backend starter or multi-inning reliever, and it's possible the secondary fastball characteristics are so strong that we're underselling him a little bit.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2014, 8th (246) - TEX\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  The Rangers gave Swanson, a junior college standout in 2014, his first chance at pro ball by taking him in the eighth round of that year's Draft.

He really took off in his second season with New York, making it to Triple-A. The Mariners noticed his improvement and acquired him in the James Paxton trade last November.  Swanson's combination of stuff, size and deception gives him the chance to remain a starter. Not only does his fastball sit in the low-90s and get to as high as 97 mph, the analytically inclined love his spin rate. That, combined with the deception in his delivery and his angle, often allows that fastball -- which he relies on heavy -- to play up better than plus. His slider and improved changeup give him two at least average secondary offerings.

He became the fallback option for clubs who were in pursuit of Shohei Ohtani, one of which was Texas, and he signed for $2.8 million in early-March of 2018. The timing of the deal, Martinez's age relative to other first-year prospects, and the lack of game action he had seen since defecting made his early-2018 developmental path tough to anticipate. The Rangers ended up starting him in the DSL (government processes and paperwork probably had something to do with that) and then skipped him over the AZL and sent him to the Northwest League for the final two months of the summer.    His Fall League stint, though, was more telling. At that point, he had played enough to be sharp again, but not so much as to be gassed, and the opposing pitching in Arizona was an age-appropriate challenge while the NWL was arguably not. And Martinez's showing in the AFL was fine. He has all sorts of tricks for trying to reach base; he'll bunt for hits, he'll show bunt and then try to poke liners over the heads of approaching infielders, he'll occasionally walk toward the front of the batter's box during the pitcher's delivery and try to slash awkward contact somewhere while giving himself a head start down the line. Martinez's bat head drags into the zone a little bit and while he can adjust his lower half to alter the vertical placement of his barrel, he can also get tied up by velo inside. He projects as a middling offensive player with plus speed, and a capable defender in center. He may be a second division regular but is probably a platoon or fourth outfielder on a contending team.

He had starred in Cuba's top league as a 20-year-old in 2016-17, then spent two seasons in the independent Can-Am League after defecting. In his first year in affiliated ball, he held his own in the short-season Northwest League and starred in the Arizona Fall League.  With his plate discipline and plus speed, Martinez could fit at the top of a big league batting order. He has a good feel for putting the barrel on the ball, though his left-handed swing can get too long when he tries to hit home runs. While he's not a big guy, he generates solid raw power with his quick bat and deceptive strength in his hands and wrists.  Martinez has the speed to be an asset as a basestealer and a center fielder, but he's still learning how to make the most of it. He needs to improve his jumps on the bases and in the outfield.

He threw more strikes in affiliated ball than he did during the spring in extended, then arrived to 2019 camp with a better changeup.

Signed for $275,000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2015, the latter made his U.S. debut last summer.  Santos' fastball velocity continues to climb as he matures physically, and he sat at 92-96 mph and touched 98 as an 18-year-old in 2018. His heater comes with heavy sink that makes it difficult to lift, as evidenced by his outstanding home run rate (0.4 per nine innings) and groundout/airout ratio (2.4) in his first three pro seasons. His 82-85 mph slider lacks consistency but shows flashes of becoming a plus offering.

He has shown more arm speed since having his elbow reconstructed and now works at 91-94 and touches 96 mph with his fastball. An upper-70s downer curveball is his second-most reliable option, a mid-80s cutter he began throwing in 2018 has promise and his changeup features some fade and should improve if he uses it more often.   Hentges uses his 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters delivery to create steep downhill plane on his pitches, which helped him top the Carolina League in home-run rate (0.3 per nine innings).

They considered calling him up to the big leagues in September until he wore down late in the summer.  Sandlin overcomes being a 5-foot-11 right-hander without overpowering stuff by confounding hitters with a mix of five pitches from three different arm slots. His best offering is a two-seam fastball with unusual velocity (up to 95 mph) with nasty life from a sidearm angle. He also throws a sweeping slider from down low, a changeup from a low-three-quarters slot and a four-seamer and a curveball from a high-three-quarters slot.

His Draft appeal was tied to his future in that role, so naturally there was concern when forearm tightness forced him to miss several starts as a junior. He still earned a second-round selection that June, and then reached Class A Hagerstown in his pro debut after signing for slot value.  Cate might have had the best breaking ball in his Draft class, a 12-to-6 hammer that is widely viewed as at least a plus pitch. Cate will throw it whenever he wants in the count and can command it very well in the strike zone. He throws it from the same plane as his fastball, giving hitters little chance to pick it up. That, in turn, allows his 90-93 mph fastball to be more effective. It has more run than sink, with average life overall, and Cate can throw it to both sides of the plate consistently. His changeup is a little firm and a distant third pitch, but he shows enough feel for it to be a future average offering.  Cate isn't the biggest guy in the world at 6 feet, and concern about overuse during his time at UConn certainly wasn't assuaged with his 2018 injury.

Scouts often project heavily on the command of athletic pitchers, as well as pitchers with with good deliveries; those traits often go hand in hand. But the aesthetic pleasure one derives from Gil's velvety mechanics is subverted by release inconsistency, a dichotomy also displayed by frustrating Dodgers prospect Yadier Alvarez throughout his young career. It also might simply be unreasonable to expect an inexperienced 20-year-old with this kind of velocity to have any idea where it's going.

The Dominican had shoulder surgery following his 2015 pro debut and missed all of the next season before showing flashes of a mid-90s fastball when he returned. When the Yankees needed roster space after signing Neil Walker in March 2018, they designated Jake Cave for assignment and traded him to Minnesota for Gil.  Gil's big arm stands out in a system filled with big arms, because he regularly operates at 94-98 mph and can reach 101 mph with his four-seam fastball. He keeps his velocity deep into his starts and can blow his heater by hitters up in the strike zone. He can also miss bats with a power curveball that has exceptional spin rates and has begun to work on a changeup that has a long ways to go.  The fact that Gil didn't reach full-season ball in his first five years as a pro testifies to how he's very much a work in progress.

The injury washed away the rest of 2016 and essentially all of 2017, as a visibly hobbled Lewis stopped and started baseball activity several times due to ongoing issues with the knee. He even began 2018 with a month-long stay on the injured list because he wasn't a full go when spring training began. He was healthy for the rest of 2018 but his performance was mixed, and his tools beneath where they were in college. He was clearly less explosive than most of his peers at the Futures Game were, but of course at that point he had only been playing healthy, regular baseball for about two months.   This spring, the physical ability that had scouts calling Lewis the most talented prospect on Cape Cod -- and that drove him to near the top of 2016 draft boards -- has returned. That injured right knee looks healthy as it twists and bends through contact. It's shouldering more of a mechanical burden now than it was in 2017, certainly, and Lewis is taking healthy but comfortable hacks with the same natural flyball loft he exhibited in college. He's hit a few impressive spring training homers but has also swung through quite a few fastballs in the zone, some in the 90-92 mph range. Teams were concerned about potential strikeout issues in college, concerns that were exacerbated by the small-school competition he faced, which served to limit the confidence teams had in his performance. This year is not only important for Lewis' development but for the industry's understanding of his profile. He finally appears healthy and he has heart-of-the order offensive talent so long as he doesn't have severe contact issues.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2016, 1st (11) - SEA\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  After a huge junior year at Mercer that resulted in winning the Golden Spikes Award in 2016, Lewis profiled as one of the top college bats in the Draft class. The Mariners were overjoyed he somehow made it out of the top 10 so they could take him No. 11 overall, and he signed almost immediately. Unfortunately, they haven't really gotten to see just what kind of player he is after a gruesome knee injury suffered in a home plate collision during his debut summer, and ensuing complications and setbacks, has kept him off the field too much.  The good news is that after missing the majority of the 2017 season, Lewis did get a decent amount of reps in and reached Double-A, while playing in the Futures Game, in 2018. Many of the tools that made him such an exciting draftee are still there offensively, from a solid overall approach, albeit with some swing and miss, to easy plus power to all fields, which showed up in flashes last year. He has an arm that fits well in right field and enough range to stay there.   The biggest adjustments Lewis will have to make will be mental ones. In 2018, he was fine going straight ahead on the run, but any time he had to cut, he would move gingerly, and it wasn't clear if it was physical or mental. The Mariners are confident Lewis, who has always shown plus makeup, has put it behind him and can finally show what he's capable of consistently.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AA\"","8","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"49.5\"","\"51.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","45","60","50","45","60","40","55","65","45","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","50","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"NYM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["301","298","398","419","760","\"47.2\"","\"45.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"47.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Riley\"","\"Pint\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1701","666207","\"pint_riley\"","","\"sa917922\"","\"|\"","","\"St. Thomas Aquinas HS (KS)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"SHwmwNMieek\"","","\"It is not enough to say that Pint is having issues with control. Even pitchers walking guys at a 10% clip or worse face legitimate questions about their ability to start, and sometimes their ability to pitch in the big leagues at all. Pint is walking more than 30% of the hitters he faces right now, and has been moved to the Low-A bullpen. He simply can't be a big leaguer with this kind of wildness, but his stuff remains incredible, among the best in the minors.   Through these struggles, Pint has continued to throw in the upper-90s with one of the harder power curveballs on the planet. He has top of the rotation stuff, but even those in amateur scouting who thought his delivery was too violent to repeat (which would make it tough to start) did not think Pint's strike-throwing issues would be this much of a problem. We'd still take him ahead of relief-only types in this class because the stuff is so good, teams felt good about his makeup before the draft, and Pint is still pretty young. With time, he's pretty likely to figure something out, though it's suddenly very likely to be in some kind of bullpen role.\"","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2016, 1st (4) - COL\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 75 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 40 | Overall: 50  Pint was one of the most exciting prospects in the 2016 Draft, a big, strong high school right-hander capable of hitting triple digits consistently. There would need to be work done to turn him into a complete pitcher, sure, but the upside was too much for the Rockies to pass up with the No. 4 overall pick, signing him for $4.8 million. He has had trouble gaining traction since, scuffling in his first full year and missing nearly all of 2018 due to first forearm stiffness then a strained oblique.  Based on his profile and Draft status, Pint certainly hasn't lived up to expectations thus far. The good news is he's still only 21 years old and the premium stuff that excited everyone coming out of high school is still very much there. The 6-foot-4 righty still cranks his fastball up to 97-100 mph consistently. The Rockies feel he has the best curve in the system, one that flashes as a 70 pitch, though not consistently. His above-average slider also can buckle knees and his fading changeup gives him a fourth pitch that grades out as at least above-average.  The one thing, other than health, that has held him back has been his ability to command the baseball. It will come down to him finding a way to control his effort and body, which will allow him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone more consistently. A full season should help tremendously in him taking a step from thrower to pitcher, with a frontline starter ceiling still not unreasonable to dream about.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","\"A\"","12","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (COL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","7","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"42.9\"","\"48.6\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","2.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2700","20","70","50","70","50","","","30","70","55","70","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","75","55","60","55","","","","40","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["302","299","322","206","1030","\"47.2\"","\"46.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"45.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"45.9\"","\"|\"","\"Cavan\"","\"Biggio\"","2019","\"24.1\"","\"2B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","327","624415","\"biggio_cavan\"","19252","\"sa738582\"","\"|\"","","\"Notre Dame\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2020","45","\"pwYsvgVEeiA\"","","\"Biggio opted to attend Notre Dame rather than sign with the Phillies out of high school, and he had two bad years there before turning in a solid junior season. He didn't hit for power in pro ball until he reached Double-A in 2018, where Biggio exploded for 26 home runs, saw his walk rate climb all the way to 18%, and swiped 20 bags.   Nothing about Biggio's swing is markedly different than it was in college. He's tightened the circle made by his ritualistic, pre-swing bat swirl, and his hands load a little bit lower now than they used to, but mostly Biggio just has good feel for low-ball contact despite the upright nature of his swing, and has plus bat speed.   There's skepticism surrounding Biggio's ability to play second base, so the Blue Jays began expanding his defensive horizons last year with time at first and third base, as well as both outfield corners, which is where Biggio saw the most action in the Arizona Fall League. The uppercut nature of Biggio's swing is going to lead to some strikeouts and his aggregate offensive profile looks much less promising in an outfield corner than it would at second base. If he could indeed play all of those positions, he'd be a very interesting Swiss Army knife with power, but realistically he profiles as a second-division regular or platoon outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2016, 5th (162) - TOR\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  The son of Hall of Famer Craig Biggio turned down the Phillies as a 29th-round pick out of high school to honor his commitment to Notre Dame. After improving in three straight seasons with the Fighting Irish, he received a $300,000 signing bonus as the Blue Jays' fifth-round pick in 2016. Biggio would establish himself as a legitimate prospect two years later, garnering both Rookie of the Year and MVP Award honors in the Double-A Eastern League after he led the circuit in home runs (26), slugging (.499) and OPS (.887) and ranked second in RBIs (99). He also stole 20 bases, making him one of six Minor Leaguers to total at least 20 homers and 20 steals in 2018.   Biggio's offensive game is built around his plus plate discipline and approach, as he's long showed a knack for drawing walks -- his 100 walks ranked third in the Minors -- and getting on base at a high clip. In 2018, however, he lowered his hands and began to hit the ball in the air more consistently, enabling him to tap into his above-average raw power, albeit at the expense of a higher strikeout rate and a more pull-heavy approach. He is a fringy runner who is smart on the basepaths and picks his spots to steal.   That Biggio's primary position is second base adds even more value to his offensive profile. He's a solid if unspectacular defender there, making up for modest range with sure-handedness, sound footwork and good instincts. The Blue Jays have steadily increased Biggio's versatility, offering him reps at both infield corners to go along with his usual work at the keystone, and he added the outfield to his resume in the Arizona Fall League. At the least, Biggio appears bound for a utility role in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"MLB\"","10","\"2016 Draft Rnd 5 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.1\"","\"45.5\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","40","45","55","45","40","50","40","50","55","40","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","45","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["303","300","298","361","362","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"45.0\"","\"50.2\"","\"43.3\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Jose\"","\"Soriano\"","2019","\"20.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"168\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","1934","667755","","","\"sa916702\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"CUj52ZM2wzU\"","","\"Soriano struggled to harness his newfound velocity in 2018. The year before, he was a skinny 18-year-old sitting just 87-92. When he arrived in the spring of 2018, he had added sculpted muscle mass to a prototypical frame, and his fastball was humming in at 94-97 early during spring outings. After some time in extended spring Ttaining, Soriano spent the end of last summer in Low-A as a 19-year-old, and had issues with walks. Though his delivery is devoid of violence, he struggles with release consistency and has scattershot fastball control as a result. Soriano's feel for locating his terrific curveball is often superior to his fastball command, and while this approach is becoming more acceptable in the majors, he'd ideally refine the latter.   It's odd to look at Soriano's numbers and argue that he took a step forward last year, but he accomplished a third of the things we hoped he'd develop -- more velocity, better command, and a better changeup or some other third offering -- before turning 20. If either of the last two components fails to progress, Soriano will end up in the bullpen.

After Soriano's stellar United States debut in '17, the Angels pushed Soriano to full-season ball after extended spring training in 2018, where the teenager struggled at first, but finished relatively strongly.    Soriano screams projectability and high ceiling, and he's starting to put his considerable tools together on the mound. His electric fastball will touch 97-98 mph and there's still room for more consistent velocity as he grows into his 6-foot-3 frame. He's always been able to spin his breaking ball, but he improved the consistency in throwing it effectively as it trends towards being a plus pitch. The Angels pushed him to throw his changeup more, and he did it 15 percent of the time in 2018, and it took a big step forward as a result, showing a much better feel for the off-speed pitch.    While Soriano's walk rate spiked in 2018, there is confidence he'll get to average command and control eventually thanks to a very athletic delivery. All he needs are innings and the gloves should come off a bit in 2019, with a chance for him to make a nice leap up this list.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"A\"","10","\"2015 J2 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"42.5\"","\"52.5\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2300","40","55","30","50","","","","50","60","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","50","55","","","","","45","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["304","301","274","420","181","\"47.2\"","\"46.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"52.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"52.3\"","\"|\"","\"Chris\"","\"Rodriguez\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1929","669735","","","\"sa917980\"","\"|\"","","\"Monsignor Pace HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"XVIkcyUC3as\"","","\"A stress reaction in his back cost Rodriguez all of 2018 and his return to action has been slow; last we were updated before publication, he was still limited to fastball-only bullpens and flat ground sessions.

Both of his breaking balls were excellent, but his changeup had regressed a bit compared to his first year (or at least, he lacked feel for it the last time Eric saw him). The injury adds fuel to the speculative fire that Rodriguez's violent delivery will eventually limit him to the bullpen. It didn't prohibit him from having starter control, but scouts were concerned about injury. Now, there has been one. If health eventually moves Rodriguez to the bullpen, he has high-leverage stuff.

While he pitched well in his debut that summer and did reach full-season ball in '17, it's still mostly about potential for Rodriguez, who missed all of the '18 season with a stress reaction his back. Any hopes for progress in 2019 were dashed when he needed surgery to repair a stress fracture in his back.  While all signs had pointed to a successful rehab and Rodriguez gave a lot of focus to conditioning, the recurrence of his back issues is concerning. The hope is that he can get back to refining the four-pitch mix that excited everyone in the organization. He throws both a live four-seam and sinking two-seam fastball, touching the upper-90s with the former at times, and backs it up with a hard slider that flashes plus. His changeup might be as good, if not better and he flips in an average curveball as well. With a relatively clean delivery, he should be a good strike-thrower.

Much of Reynolds' profile depends upon his ability to stay in center field and the general consensus is that he's a 45 or 50 defender out there. We keep waiting for Reynolds' BABIP to regress (it hasn't), and we expect his unusually high walk rate from 2018 to do eventually so as well (though, he was very selective in the Fall League), but ulimately he projects to be an average offensive player who is fine in center field, which would make him an everyday player of some kind.

He continued to do what he did in college, hit, over his first year-plus in the Giants' organization, and was then sent to the Pirates before the '18 season in the Andrew McCutchen trade.

He made up for lost at-bats in the Arizona Fall League, and while he wasn't productive and his hand experienced some soreness, he maintained his outstanding plate discipline and consistently had quality at-bats. Reynolds will still chase with two strikes, but he's learning to control the strike zone and get on base at a better clip than anticipated. He does have the ability to drive the ball, but it's unclear just how much power he'll have as he's generally been geared to contact.  While not a burner, Reynolds is sneaky quick and has really good reads and routes in the outfield, allowing him to be a solid defender in center. He'll continue to get time in all three outfield spots, waiting for his first chance to impact the big league roster.

Mostly though, Jones is good because he makes lots of hard, line drive contact and is a plus runner. After struggling to lay off of breaking balls early in 2017, he has become more patient, and his walk rate was much higher last year. Even though he didn't hit for much power in the Cal League, the Angels promoted him to Double-A for the last two months of the season, then gave him some run in the Arizona Fall League.

One brother, T.J., is a wide receiver for the Detroit Lions. His other brother, Malachi, was the Arena Football League Receiver of the Year in 2018, and his late father, Andre, won a national title with Notre Dame. Jahmai Jones was a two-sport star but always felt baseball was his passion, signing with the Angels for above pick value in the second round of the 2015 Draft. An outfielder at the outset of his pro career, he shifted to second base in 2018 and reached Double-A.    Jones played second base in high school, but the jury had been out in his Draft year whether he would be better suited there or in the outfield. He had played solid defense in the outfield for the Angels, but the organization felt he had a better chance of reaching the big leagues back on the infield. He's still learning the nuances of the position, getting a lot more reps during his strong Arizona Fall League stint, and should be capable enough to stay there. The position switch clearly impacted his offensive output, but he still showed the ability to draw walks, steal bases and drive the ball with sneaky pop, thanks to excellent bat speed.    Despite the relatively down year offensively, the Angels are confident Jones will get back to his typical production now that he's more comfortable back on the dirt. His plus makeup and work ethic should aid him in becoming a solid everyday second baseman.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"AA\"","8","\"2015 Draft Rnd 2 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"43.6\"","\"50.9\"","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","40","40","50","60","40","45","55","45","50","60","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","60","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"NYM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["307","304","223","209","302","\"47.2\"","\"47.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","\"Moises\"","\"Gomez\"","2019","\"20.8\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","3030","664332","","","\"sa875163\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"z10zQ90DBo4\"","","\"Gomez was a plus-running center field prospect when he signed, but over four seasons, his body has matured in a way that is more Wily Mo Pena than Willy Taveras. He has already moved to a corner and might be limited to left field, but with that heft came power and a 2018 statistical breakout (65 extra-base hits) at Low-A Bowling Green. Gomez has below-average plate discipline, and that kind of flaw in a player near the bottom of the defensive spectrum is pretty scary, because it means both the hit and power tools need to develop into plusses for Gomez to clear the overall offensive bar at his position. There's enough thump here for that, though we'll have to wait and see on the bat.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","","\"April 28, 2015 - TB\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Signed for $40,000 out of Venezuela in 2015, Gomez improved in each of his first two seasons in pro ball before moving up to full-season Class A Bowling Green and breaking out in 2018. At age 19, Gomez led the Midwest League with 34 doubles, 60 extra-base hits, 82 RBIs and 237 total bases. He also hit 19 home runs, good for fourth in the circuit, and finished second with a .503 slugging. He continued to boost his stock during the offseason in the Venezuelan Winter League, garnering Rookie of the Year honors after he delivered six homers and 26 RBIs over 35 games.   Gomez is physically put together and looks the part of a future big leaguer. His strength really shows when he swings the bat, as he'll generate huge raw power from the right side of the plate that often translates to tape-measure home runs during games. Gomez's power does come with a heavy dose of swing-and-miss, which in turn raises concerns about his hitting ability, but scouts who saw him last season were impressed by his feel for the barrel and believe he'll make more contact as his pitch recognition improves. He's an average runner, perhaps a tick above, and moves well underway, though he's likely to lose a step or two as he continues to add strength.   Gomez fits better in left field than right because his arm strength is only slightly above average. Evaluators believe he'll be an average defensive corner outfielder once he improves his reads and routes, though it's widely agreed that it will be Gomez's bat that dictates his development. If it all clicks, Gomez could be hitting 25-plus homers from the middle of the Rays' lineup in a matter of years.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"A+\"","13","\"2015 J2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.4\"","\"52.7\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","35","60","55","45","55","50","55","60","50","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["308","305","450","529","491","\"47.1\"","\"45.1\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.4\"","\"47.5\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Blaine\"","\"Knight\"","2019","\"22.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","2101","667421","\"knight_blaine\"","","\"sa3008532\"","\"|\"","","\"Arkansas\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","","\"Knight was an a draft eligible 21-year-old sophomore in 2017 when he starred for Arkansas, but he went in the late rounds when his high price tag didn't match his upside on the mound, where he lacks a plus pitch. He performed about the same as a junior but had a little less leverage and opted to start his pro career when the Orioles took him in the third round. The main concern with Knight is his slight build, which makes many scouts hesitant to project him as a 180 inning starter. Everyone agrees that Knight is a performer who competes and throws three average to above pitches for strikes. He'll hit 96 or 97 early in games then settle at 91-94 mph, relying mostly on a curveball that has a high spin rate but grades as a 55 for most scouts.

As a junior, Knight once again ranked among the Southeastern Conference's premier starters and helped lead the Razorbacks to a runner-up finish in the 2018 College World Series. The Orioles, after selecting Knight in the third round in June, went $436,800 above slot to sign the right-hander for $1.1 million.  Knight may be extremely skinny, listed at 6-foot-3 and 165 pounds, but he has some power to his fastball, which sits at 90-94 mph and peaks at 97. He also has a mid-80s slider that has a high spin rate and qualifies as a plus pitch at its best. He also will mix in an effective changeup and a curveball he can throw for strikes. Knight has a quick arm and generates velocity without much effort in a repeatable delivery that allows him to fill the strike zone.  Knight's stuff stands to improve in the professional ranks if he can add weight to his wiry frame. It also would help answer questions about his durability, especially after Arkansas held him out of summer ball for two straight years and limited him in fall practice as a junior. It's a mid-rotation profile if all comes together for Knight, though he's likely to be brought along slowly given the relevant concerns about his durability.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"A+\"","19","\"2018 Draft Rnd 3 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.9\"","\"50.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.5000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2850","45","50","45","55","50","","","50","50","50","55","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","50","55","","","","50","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["309","306","363","530","180","\"47.1\"","\"45.6\"","\"42.9\"","\"52.0\"","\"44.7\"","\"52.7\"","\"|\"","\"Osiel\"","\"Rodriguez\"","2019","\"17.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2320","682640","","","","\"|\"","","\"Cuba\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","\"_Jj3rLa-Lm4\"","","\"For a 16-year-old, high bonus pitcher, Rodriguez was a rarity in a number of ways. Since he defected from Cuba, he had a pretty long track record of high-level international competition. He pitched as a 14-year-old for the 15-and-under Cuban team, and posted a 69 IP, 32 H, 2 XBH, 20 BB, 102 K line. Then, at 15 years old, he pitched for the 18-and-under team and posted a 21 IP, 16 H, 4 BB, 25 K line. He also struck out five of the six batters he faced in the MLB showcase in February, which is the linked video. On top of that, Rodriguez flashes four above average to plus pitches, has hit 97 mph and has starter-caliber feel to pitch. He's also 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds, and has some room to add muscle. If you're looking for things to nitpick, there's some effort to his delivery that should be ironed out, and he does vary his arm slot, though it's by choice. The Yankees will try to limit him to two breaking balls and one slot, but recognize that Rodriguez could be one of those rare pitchers like El Duque who can be effective throwing the kitchen sink from a half dozen different arm slots. Going back to what's rare about Rodriguez, he seems to have it all, except for maybe an ideal present delivery and, obviously, stateside pro performance. This is about as high as we can rank a teenage pitching prospect who has only been seen a handful of times and hasn't really faced many hitters who can handle his stuff, but there's lots of room to grow on this 40+ FV if this trajectory continues.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"July 2, 2018 - NYY\"","2023","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  The Yankees' trade for Luke Voit last July gave them not only a surprising slugger who hit 14 homers in the final two months of the season, but also international bonus pool money in exchange for shipping Giovanny Gallegos and Chasen Shreve to the Cardinals. They used most of that extra cash to sign Rodriguez for $600,000 the next day. He had overmatched Cuba's 15-and-under league and starred for its youth national teams before defecting.  Somewhat reminiscent of former Yankees star Orlando Hernandez, Rodriguez has a seemingly endless combination of pitches and arm slots. He has an electric arm that produces 92-95 mph fastballs that top out at 97 with high spin rates that give him riding life up in the strike zone. His hard curveball is a bit more effective than his harder slider, with both displaying the potential to become plus pitches, and his changeup has splitter action and similar upside.  Though Rodriguez varying his arm slot adds to his deception, New York probably will try to condense his pitch/slot options when he makes his pro debut in 2019. He doesn't have the cleanest arm action and there's effort in his delivery, yet he had no difficulty throwing strikes as an amateur. He has a lofty ceiling, as his chance to develop four plus offerings could make him a frontline starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","","15","\"2018 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.6\"","\"54.3\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","0.7500","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","35","60","45","50","45","","","50","60","55","60","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","55","","","","50","","",""],["310","307","310","205","974","\"47.1\"","\"46.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"46.3\"","\"42.6\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","\"Luis Alexander\"","\"Basabe\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"CF\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","1478","642772","","","\"sa736915\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2019","45","\"xQYw0z5Pmvs\"","","\"Basabe shredded the Carolina League for the first two and a half months of 2018 -- hitting .266/.370/.502 -- then had one of the year's most impressive feats of strength when he turned around a 102 mph Hunter Greene fastball at the Futures Game, and deposited it 10 rows deep to right-center field. His second half with Double-A Birmingham was less successful, and just as Basabe appeared to be adjusting to the better pitching in August, he would again struggle in the Arizona Fall League. Perhaps the most notable takeaway from the AFL is that Basabe's instincts in center field are not great, and he may be better suited for a corner despite his speed. If that's the case (it'd be fair to assume Basabe was gassed during the AFL and to just exclude that look from consideration) then the swing and miss aspect of the profile (27% K% last year) becomes a little scary. But Basabe has a potent collection of physical tools, he's walked at an above-average clip, his modest power plays in games because he lifts the ball, and all of that should enable him to be a second division regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","","\"Aug. 26, 2012\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The Red Sox signed the identical Basabe twins to matching $450,000 bonuses out of Venezuela in August 2012 and traded them both in 2016, sending Luis Alejandro to the D-backs in a deal for Brad Ziegler in July and Luis Alexander to the White Sox as part of a package for Chris Sale in December. Luis Alexander struggled with a torn meniscus in his left knee in his first season with his new organization, but he held his own in Double-A at age 21 in his second and homered off a 102-mph fastball from the Reds' Hunter Greene in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game. Basabe broke the hamate bone in his left hand during Spring Training.  Though Yoan Moncada and Michael Kopech hogged most of the hype in the Sale deal, Basabe is a switch-hitter with five-tool potential and the ability to play a premium position. While he has yet to have a breakout year at the plate, he works counts, draws walks and makes a lot of hard contact. His bat speed and the strength in his hands and wrists give him at least average power potential, and he has begun to unlock more of it by taking a more direct path to the ball and driving more balls in the air.  With his plus speed, Basabe could be at least a 20-20 player if he continues to refine his hitting and baserunning skills. Though he briefly shifted to right field when he played on the same team as Andrew Benintendi in the Boston system, he has spent most of his career in center and can play there in the big leagues.

Tanner is a totally different baseball entity, standing apart not just from his father but from the rest of the minors, and access to such a unique skillset is partly what motivated the curious Rays to draft him in the second round in 2018. Dodson was Cal's two-hole hitter, starting center fielder, and closer. If forced to chose a traditional developmental path, teams would have overwhelmingly preferred Dodson on the mound, where his stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever. But Dodson is also a plus-running switch-hitter, with some natural lift as a right-handed hitter and good barrel control as a lefty. The Rays want to take advantage of all of Dodson's skills and asked that he be announced on draft day as a two-way player. At Cal, Dodson would often warm up his arm in center field, sometimes very little, before coming in to pitch in save situations. In pro ball, he pitched once every seven days, would have a bullpen day at the midpoint between outings, and either DH or play CF on the other days. Developing as a two-way player is actually less labor intensive than existing as one in college, where Dodson's schedule was more variable. Neither of Dodson's individual roles projects to be one of impact. On the mound he looks like a middle reliever; with the bat he looks like a fourth outfielder. But if he performs like a standard 40-inning reliever, like Jacob Barnes, and quintessential fourth outfielder, like Travis Jankowski, he'll generate 1.5 to 2 annual WAR, combined.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2018, CBB (71) - TB\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  It's certainly not uncommon to have the Cape Cod League batting champ rated highly for the next year's Draft. When that batting champion is almost certainly going to be drafted to pitch, that is a little more unusual. That was the dilemma with Dodson ahead of the 2018 Draft until the Rays, an organization one year removed from drafting two-way phenom Brendan McKay in the first round, selected him with the No. 71 overall pick and announced that he would both play the outfield and pitch in the professional ranks. He excelled on both sides of the ball during his pro debut in the New York-Penn League, converting skeptics of his two-way potential into believers.   Dodson showed power stuff in an explosive 95-98 mph fastball and a wipeout slider that touched 91 mph while coming out of Hudson Valley's bullpen. The combo is already lethal on right-handed hitters, and he still has room to improve his control and command. When he's not on the mound, Dodson is an above-average defender in center field who hits for average from both sides of the plate and contributes on the basepaths with above-average wheels.   The early returns from the start of Dodson's two-way career were all positive. He posted a 0.68 WHIP and averaged a strikeout-per-inning across 25 frames, holding hitters to a paltry .143 average. At the plate, he slashed .273/.344/.369 with 12 extra-base hits and eight steals. It will be interesting to see how well and for how long Dodson can continue that level of production in both roles, but even as just a reliever he offers the Rays plenty of value given his late-inning potential.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"A+\"","27","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"36.8\"","\"46.8\"","","\"46.7\"","\"51.7\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","50","55","45","60","45","40","50","55","50","60","\"|\"","","2250","2450","40","60","45","","55","","","45","65","50","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","50","","60","","","","45","","",""],["312","309","362","418","634","\"47.0\"","\"45.6\"","\"44.3\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.6\"","\"48.8\"","\"|\"","\"Brock\"","\"Burke\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"76\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2246","656271","","","\"sa828798\"","\"|\"","","\"Evergreen HS (CO)\"","0","1","","\"High\"","2020","42","","","\"Burke got on a weighted ball program before the 2017 season and, perhaps more as a result of the physical conditioning aspect of the program, began improving. His ascent continued, and accelerated, during a 2018 that ended with a dynamite month and a half at Double-A Montgomery, during which he struck out 71 hitters in 55 innings.   Burke's fastball plays up because he gets way down the mound and generates a lot of backspin on the ball, creating perceived rise. Changeup development seemed to occur in 2018, as the pitch was much different last year (82-85 mph, at times with cut) than it was in 2017 (78-80 mph), and its fair to speculate that something like a grip change took place here. Burke has two breaking balls that are both about average, though he uses the curveball pretty sparingly. Glove-side command of his cutter/slider makes him tough on righties. One source considers Burke's delivery fairly easy to time because of its pacing, so maybe we need to see more curveballs as a way of disrupting timing.

His stuff jumped a notch last summer when he got to Double-A, where he logged a 1.95 ERA in nine starts, and he earned Tampa Bay's Minor League Pitcher of the Year Award. The Rangers acquired him along with three other prospects and international bonus pool money in a three-team trade in December that sent Jurickson Profar to the A's and lefty pitching prospect Rollie Lacy to the Rays.  As Burke has matured physically, he has added to his fastball velocity and his ability to maintain it deeper into games, and he now operates at 90-94 mph with a peak of 96 and some running life. His heater plays better than its velocity because his delivery and 6-foot-4 frame create good extension and plane. His slider has also added power and features late bite, and his fading changeup continues to improve and shows flashes of giving him a solid third offering.  Burke battled his control when he first entered pro ball but now has no difficulty finding the strike zone. He has deception in his delivery that makes it difficult for hitters to barrel his pitches.

The 20-year-old was given an assignment that matched his loud tools (teams who saw him work out were putting 6's and 7's on his speed, arm, and defense at short) but not his readiness, and he was bad early in the year at Low-A Dayton. He came on, statistically, at the end of the year, but didn't walk much in either phase. Latin American players who have spent their entire lives playing ball back home, or in Florida or Arizona, sometimes struggle with the early-April chill of the Midwest League when they're first assigned there; as if being 20 in a full-season league after not playing for over a year wasn't enough, Garcia may have struggled with this. 2019 should be a more representative sample statistically of what Garcia is. There's no question about his run, field or throw tools, and he was seen at a bat-first prospect early in his Cuban career, so that might be in there, too. If he can develop some confidence around his offense, Garcia could quickly jump into 50 FV territory, which is where we had him last year based on how he worked out for teams.

Then they had to wait 10 months to see him play in real competition, after he hadn't played for quite some time after defecting, challenging him with an assignment to full-season ball. After stumbling out of the gate, fans got to see what the fuss was all about in the second half of 2018.      Despite some concerns of pushing him too hard, Garcia was skipped over rookie ball and sent straight to the Midwest League with Dayton. The Reds were glad that they did. After he struggled at the plate the first three months, Garcia started to figure it out in the second half, hitting for average and showing some power, with five of his six homers for the season. He has shown a balanced set-up at the plate and the ability to send line drives to all fields, though he'll have to continue to refine his overall approach. He did deal with a left shoulder injury as well, but it was not too serious.    Garcia's plus speed and athleticism allows him to have very good range, and he has more than enough arm for the position.

The quality of his at-bats and the senselessly aggressive hacks Lee would take were not traits of physical exhaustion. Ultimately, we've left Lee where we've had him since he suddenly grew into power during his senior year of high school.   Once a little two-way LHP/CF prospect, he's now a right fielder with power, who walks and is currently stealing bases. A 40 runner from home to first, Lee runs better than that under way but was too brazen a thief early in his career and made too many outs on the bases. He got better at picking his spots last year. Lee's contact rates are concerning, but they're offset by the walks and thump enough that we think he projects as a solid-average regular in right field.\"","\"|\"","","\"KC\"","\"2016, 3rd (103) - KC\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 65 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  A talented two-way player as a high schooler in Virginia -- one many teams preferred as a left-handed pitcher -- Lee's athleticism and offensive upside appealed to the Royals, who drafted him in the third round of the 2016 Draft and went over pick value to sign him. He's moved rapidly thus far, making his Double-A debut right after he turned 20 in 2018.  Lee has the tools to be an impact player on both sides of the ball and with some adjustments to his offensive approach, he could be a better than average hitter with outstanding power. While he cut down his strikeout rate considerably in 2018 and has excellent plate discipline, Lee's willingness to see pitches can work against him. He'll often take too many hittable pitches early in counts and then hasn't altered his two-strike approach at all. If he can learn to be a bit more aggressive early in counts, then pitchers will start trying to expand the zone early, where his advanced eye will come in handy. All of that should put him in better counts to use his bat speed and loft to get to his power more frequently without his K rate skyrocketing.   Defensively, Lee can handle playing center field and will continue to get plenty of time there in the Minors. But he likely profiles better as a right fielder, where his cannon for an arm plays well and he has the chance to be a plus defender overall. The Royals are hoping his time in Double-A and in the Arizona Fall League will help him continue up the ladder quickly after he lost time due to a back injury.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","\"AA\"","7","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"50.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","35","55","55","45","60","45","50","60","50","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","55","65","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["315","312","240","202","301","\"47.0\"","\"47.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"39.2\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Tyler\"","\"Callihan\"","2019","\"18.9\"","\"3B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2841","","\"callihan_tyler\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Providence HS (GA)\"","-1","1","","\"Med\"","2022","45","","\"Old-for-the-class, mature-bodied 3B who raked during summer showcases and there's a small chance he may be able to play catcher.\"","\"Callihan was a beefy power bat early in the summer, then looked like a different guy in the fall at the Diamond Club showcase in Lakeland, shedding 10-15 lbs and looking more athletic.

A member of USA Baseball's 18-and-Under National team that took home a gold medal at the Pan American Championships in Panama, Callihan started this spring a little slowly, but his bat was coming on as his senior season wore on.     Strong and stocky, Callihan has shown an innate ability to barrel up the baseball, both at a number of elite-level events over the summer, as well as this spring, with an advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He has legitimate raw power he's already tapping into and hit two home runs, along with a .528 average during Team USA's gold medal run. He's a better athlete than you might think, though he is a below-average runner. The big question surrounding Callihan is where he'll fit defensively. He does have the chance to stick at third, with enough arm and the bat to profile there, though some worry about his range.    Callihan did get some work behind the plate, including catching some innings in the Pan Am Games, but scouts aren't sure that will work long-term.

That athleticism, along with his promising bat and feel for the game, led the Padres to sign Rosario for $1.85 million. During his 2017 professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League, he finished with a .299 average and a .404 on-base percentage, the latter a product of him walking (33) nearly as often as he struck out (36). His impressive debut earned him a promotion to the Class A Midwest League as an 18-year-old in 2018. He didn't disappoint, notching a .368 on-base percentage while showcasing an incredibly advanced plate approach for his age.   Rosario has natural hitting ability thanks to a combination of bat speed, barrel control and hand-eye coordination. He has quick hands and makes lot of hard contact from the left side of the plate, and he could grow into average power. Rosario's above-average speed enables him to cover ground with graceful strides in the outfield, and club officials are optimistic about his chances of remaining in center field.

Assuming his stuff returns, Ragans projects as a changeup/command lefty in the mold of young Cole Hamels. His low-90s fastball has bat-missing angle in the zone and he perfectly mimics his fastball's arm speed when he throws the changeup, which was already consistently plus before he got hurt. Ragans' curveball is not good, but there are several instances of pitchers having success with a playable fastball, elite changeup, and command of both, with Chris Paddack ascending for those reasons as we speak.

Texas was set to turn him loose in full-season ball in 2018, until he was diagnosed with an elbow injury in Spring Training and missed the entire year following Tommy John surgery. He reinjured his elbow just before he was set to return to game action this May and had to have his elbow reconstructed a second time.  Ragans patterned his delivery after former Rangers ace Cole Hamels and often gets compared to the four-time All-Star for his repertoire and lanky 6-foot-4 build. He has advanced feel of a plus changeup and sets it up nicely with a 91-95 mph fastball that plays better than its velocity because of its high spin rate and how well he hides the ball. His curveball has good shape and could become a solid third offering if he can add more power to it.  The athletic Ragans repeats his mechanics well and uses his size to deliver his pitches with downhill plane. Though he has all the ingredients for better than average control, he surprisingly averaged 5.7 walks per nine innings during his first two years as a pro.

He spent his first two college seasons at Louisburg (N.C.) JC as a light-hitting shortstop and worked just six innings on the mound as a sophomore. After transferring to Campbell, he has showcased two potential plus pitches and what one scouting director called the best delivery in the 2019 Draft.    Johnson has an effortless arm action and delivery, looking very natural on the mound despite his inexperience. The ball comes out of his hand so easily, with his fastball topping out at 98 mph and usually ranging from 91-95. His slider is his best secondary offering, a plus pitch in the mid-80s at its best but also still inconsistent.    As would be expected for a newcomer to the mound, Johnson still needs polish. His loopy curveball and his changeup are less reliable than his slider but can become at least average pitches with more experience.

He also has a better fastball than most left-handers when he's at his best, operating at 91-96 mph with some sink. His changeup is in its nascent stages because he hadn't needed it much coming out of the bullpen.  Even before his confusing year, Stinson came with some red flags.

When the arm speed is at it's best, Suarez's fastball has extra life and his curveball, changeup, and slider all flash above average at times. As a starter, Suarez is more average to a touch above across the board and is an innings-eating backend type, but there's much less room for error and pitchers like this can find themselves on waivers when things get out of whack.

The type of contact Arraez makes is unique. He employs a punchy, minimalist swing, and just kind of throws the bat head at the baseball, leading to lots of opposite field contact. It's worked so far, and Arraez has hit for enough contact to outweigh the total lack of game power that results from this kind of approach. It's unlikely that this is an Altuven situation where all of a sudden there's power, because Altuve was pulling the ball in the minors.   Mostly because his actions are quite good, Arraez fits fine at second base. He's a thicker guy and has begun to see more time at other positions (mostly other infield spots), and versatility will enable a team to roster Arraez even if the lack of power turns out to be a problem.

But Arraez, who put a 2017 season lost to a torn ACL in his rear-view mirror by hitting his way to Double-A in 2018, isn't too far behind.  The left-handed hitter from Venezuela has hit everywhere he's been, including finishing second in the organization (to Kirilloff) with a .310 average across two levels a year ago. Arraez has impressive bat-to-ball skills and grinds out at-bats as well as anyone in the organization, a big reason why he won the Midwest League batting title in 2016 and carries a career .329 average into 2019. He uses an extreme opposite field approach and while he's never going to be a huge power guy, if he can learn to turn on pitches to his pull side more, there is some extra-base impact for him to unlock.  Arraez has largely played second as a pro, though he saw some time at third, short and even a bit in the outfield in 2018, then played a lot at the hot corner in winter ball.

Acquired by Oakland in the 2017 Sonny Gray deal, he still hasn't thrown a single inning for an A's affiliate. Let's go over the injury history: Kap missed nearly all of 2016 due to a flexor-tendon strain, but his stuff was great when he returned for the 2016 Fall League. He blew out his UCL during 2017 spring training and needed Tommy John. In Eric's looks at Kaprielian as he rehabbed back from TJ during extended spring of 2018, he was 91-94 instead of 94-97, then was shut back down with shoulder soreness. Up again during 2018 instructional league, his fastball was 88-91. He is again day-to-day with shoulder soreness as this list goes to press.   Healthy Kaprielian will touch 99 and show four impact pitches, including a plus slider and changeup. His pitch grades are nearly identical to A.J. Puk's. Even if his stuff comes back this spring, we'll be hesitant to move him up beyond the 45 FV tier due to the threat of injury recurrence, a specter that could cause Oakland to push him quickly if his stuff bounces back, which means he could feasibly make a big league impact this year if he could just get healthy.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2015, 1st (16) - NYY\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Ranked No. 22 by MLB Pipeline on the Top 200 Draft prospects list in 2015, Kaprielian was the type of advanced college starter teams covet because of his feel for pitching and potential to move quickly through a farm system. The Yankees liked that combination enough to take him in the middle of the first round that June, but he's struggled to stay on the mound since. A forearm injury limited him to just 18 innings during his first full season in 2016, though he showed glimpses of who he can be during an Arizona Fall League stint that fall. He needed Tommy John surgery that ended his 2017 season before it began and setbacks kept him from pitching for the A's after they acquired him as part of the Sonny Gray deal at the 2017 Trade Deadline until instructs this past fall.  While at UCLA, Kaprielian had a fastball that was largely average velocity-wise, but played up because of his command of the pitch. There was excitement when he experienced a jump in his velocity at the outset of his pro career, going from 88-92 to 93-96 mph while touching 99 mph. He was healthy, finally, at instructs last fall, but wasn't popping the radar gun like that. He does have three secondary offerings that all can be above-average, with a tight slider and a changeup with good fade to it, not to mention a solid curve he mixes in effectively. Kaprielian repeats his delivery well and has always been a strike-thrower.  More than anything, the right-hander needs to turn in a healthy season.

He landed near the top of a group of top-tier toolsy outfielders, flashing plus raw power, speed, and arm strength. He also went on a tear down the stretch in the Illinois state playoffs when high-level scouts were coming in for looks, hitting homer after homer. Some scouts were still uncertain about Schnell's ultimate upside, arguing that his style of hitting indicates a swing flaw. To possess premium bat speed and face pitching in the 80s and still hit opposite field homers indicates Schnell was late on subpar stuff, and his deep hand load (which helps create the power) means this approach and his ultimate upside might not work in pro ball. While it's too early to pass judgment on that opinion, Schnell struggled against good pitching in his pro debut and in instructional league, often exhibiting poor timing and ending up late on good fastballs. The Rays aren't worried -- expectations for cold-weather hitters are close to nil in their pro debut, not only because of the big jump in competition but also because they're playing the longest season of their lives. Schnell may start 2019 in extended spring training so the org can keep a close eye on his habits and challenges in a controlled environment, but his upside is still among the best in his draft class.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2018, 1C (32) - TB\"","","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Schnell helped lead Roncalli (Indianapolis) High to an Indiana 4-A state championship in 2016 and took home the state's Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in '18 after hitting .535 with 15 home runs.

Schnell has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame. He currently has above-average speed, bordering on plus, but many evaluators believe he'll lose a step as he gets stronger.  Schnell also offers a well-rounded defensive package. He has the speed and instincts to stick in center field and arm strength -- he showed a fastball that reached the low-90s in high school -- that's suitable for right now.

Collecting stats from summer showcase events, or even spring games when prep hitters face pro-quality pitching, is one way to pinpoint how advanced a prospect is beyond a pure scouting report, and is something almost no clubs did systematically until the last half dozen years or so. Jackson is a perfect example of the limitations of this practice.   He stood out on the showcase circuit with an infielder's footwork and actions (though his hands were inconsistent) and potentially above-average offense. But Jackson's performance was generally below average in this setting and he struck out a lot, so he was shifted into the fourth to fifth round area that often sends this sort of player to college. In the spring, Jackson was going off against poor competition in South Alabama and we were hesitant to shift his grade on that basis until we were told that he got glasses to correct some vision issues that had contributed to his summer disappointment. Now, his spring performance could still end up meaning little, but there was a shot he was a new prospect, and we never got a pre-draft opportunity to see him against good pitching. With that optimism in mind, we ranked him 31st in the 2018 draft class but the Angels were able to get him at 57th overall, as many clubs now run their draft off of models that lean heavily on summer performance when there's bulk and Jackson was at almost every event.  Jackson hit seven homers with above average production across the board in 43 pro games after signing, and it's looking like he may have been underrated by a purely numbers-based approach to the draft. We see a potential 50 or 55 on every tool and at least a third base fit in pro ball, if not a chance to play middle infield, which translates to a strong regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2018, 2nd (57) - LAA\"","","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45    The Angels went all in on high school bats at the top of the 2018 Draft, taking Jordyn Adams in the first round, then drafting Jackson out of the Alabama prep ranks in the second.

Jackson has the bat speed and developing strength that point to being an offensive force, one who has the chance to hit for average and some power. He has shown the ability to use the entire field and hit three of his seven home runs during his debut the other way, though he'll have to refine his approach and reign in the strikeouts as he progresses through the system. Jackson has the arm and hands to play shortstop, and he played there almost exclusively last summer, but his lack of speed has some evaluators predicting a move to second.

His arm action is a little stiff, but its fast, and generates a fastball in the 92-96 mph range (mostly 3s and 4s) with riding life. Grays size and the drop and drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat plane that plays well up in the zone. Hell miss bats at the letters with his heater. Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone fairly new to pitching who has this kind of stuff, with a notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side.   The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, its a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average.   Because of the strike throwing, fastball efficacy, and ability to spin the breaking ball give him a good shot to play a big league role, and we've moved Gray up beyond where we had him pre-draft. The athleticism, small school pedigree, and position player conversion aspect of the profile indicates theres significant potential for growth as Gray gets on-mound experience.

After he went 11-0 and ranked third in D-II with a 1.25 ERA last spring, he signed with the Reds for $772,500 as a supplemental second-round pick.  Gray works with a 90-95 mph fastball that tops out at 97 with nice carry in the strike zone, generating velocity with a quick arm and maintaining it deep into games. His low-80s slider shows sharpness and signs of becoming a plus pitch, though it lacks consistency and he sometimes struggles to command it. He didn't use his changeup much in college but made some progress with it in his pro debut and the Dodgers believe it could become a solid third offering.  The athleticism that made Gray a shortstop also allows him to pound the strike zone with his fastball. If he can refine his secondary pitches and command, he could become a mid-rotation starter.

He's little, doesn't throw hard, and he got hit around in his first taste of the big leagues, which is what scouts were afraid might happen to him because of the velo.

On the one hand, he's had success, pitching well at pretty much every stop in the Minors and making his Major League debut in 2018 before he turned 21 years old. On the other, he doesn't have eye-popping stuff, limiting his ceiling and leaving little margin for error.  Allard's fastball comes in at 88-93 mph, grading out as fringy based only on velocity, but it plays up to average because he commands the pitch well. Both his changeup and curve can be above-average, but neither present themselves as true out pitches at the big league level. He's a good strike-thrower, but needs pinpoint command to have success in Atlanta.  Allard is way ahead of the curve age-wise, providing hope he can figure things out. He knows he can't make a mistake over the plate and is very good to his arm side, but he needs to improve his glove side command. With a tendency to pitch away to right-handers, good hitters will sit on that, so an ability to pitch to all quadrants is essential. If he can establish that glove side command, even if off the plate, that could help him stick as a back-end starter in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ATL\"","\"AAA\"","13","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (ATL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"49.2\"","\"55.0\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","1775","50","40","50","55","","","","60","40","55","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","55","","","","","55","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["327","324","502","523","633","\"46.8\"","\"44.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.2\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Melvin\"","\"Adon\"","2019","\"25.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"235\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2288","661536","","","\"sa873314\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","42","\"6ghLcOh-UlI\"","","\"A raw, arm strength goon for what seemed like forever, Adon found slider feel late last season and had dominant stretches where he looked like a potential closer.

Adon still just kind of chucks his fastball and hopes it arrives near the plate, but he's going to get away with mistakes in the zone because of the velocity.

Raw on the mound despite his advanced age, he has yet to work 100 innings in a season and spent 2018 in high Class A as a 24-year-old. He impressed as a reliever in the Arizona Fall League after the season, so the Giants could decide to expedite him in that role.  Adon has an electric fastball with running life that parks at 95-98 mph and has reached 102 mph in shorter stints. In the AFL, he worked on a two-seamer that sat in the mid-90s with some sink. His upper-80s slider is more notable for its velocity than its sharpness, while his changeup is often too firm to be effective.  San Francisco has deployed Adon as a starter because he needs innings to transition from thrower to pitcher, but scouts long have projected him to wind up in the bullpen.

His mid-80s slider is inconsistent but can be overpowering when he stays on top of it and creates sharp bite. He mainly relies on throwing the ball by hitters at this point but will have to refine his changeup and use it more often if he remains a starter.  While Vargas has a quick arm and doesn't have much effort in his delivery, he has a long ways to go in terms of repeating his delivery and throwing strikes.

Ender Inciarte and Brett Gardner are two examples of far right tail outcomes for players of this ilk.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","","\"July 5, 2016 - PHI\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Back in July 2015, Muzziotti was an intriguing prospect coming out of Venezuela who signed with the Red Sox for $300,000. After beginning his career in that organization in the Domincan Summer League, he was declared a free agent by Major League Baseball because of signing infractions involving him and four other prospects. The Phillies signed him quickly and he's been progressing methodically, making his United States debut in '17 and getting his first taste of full-season ball in '18.  As with most young hitters, Muzziotti still needs to work on refining his overall approach, but he already brings to the table the ability to make consistent contact, a knack for line drives and rarely striking out. He is starting to get more physical and is adding strength, so there is some hope there will be more power to come, though it's unlikely he'll ever be a huge home run threat. A solid athlete, Muzziotti runs well and has the instincts to steal some bases. He also has shown the ability to handle center field capably, sometimes showing plus defense out there, with a strong arm.  If his bat can continue to develop and he can stay in center field, Muzziotti has the chance to be a solid big league regular. If not, his floor might be as an excellent contributor as a fourth outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","\"A+\"","9","\"2015* J2 (BOS*)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"52.7\"","\"45.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","20","40","60","45","55","60","40","45","60","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","55","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["330","327","330","196","844","\"46.8\"","\"46.0\"","\"46.4\"","\"47.3\"","\"36.1\"","\"48.4\"","\"|\"","\"Anthony\"","\"Volpe\"","2019","\"18.1\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"180\"","\"draft\"","360","8","\"|\"","2864","","\"volpe_anthony\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Delbarton HS (NJ)\"","0","1","","\"Low\"","2023","45","","\"Silky smooth defender at short with plus actions.

Volpe is the kind of player who grows on evaluators the more they see him, with his whole being greater than the sum of his parts. He gets an 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale for his makeup and work ethic. He does have a solid approach at the plate with excellent bat control and while he doesn't have a ton of power, there is enough strength to keep pitchers honest, like when he went deep at the NHSI. Though he's not a burner, Volpe runs well and has good instincts on the bases and defensively. He has good hands and footwork and while he might have an average arm, some feel it might mean that second base will be a better long-term home for him, even if a team sends him out as a shortstop initially  Because of his track record for performing well against good competition and his makeup, it might be wrong to bet against Volpe.

He had a silky smooth delivery and projectable frame, with average big league stuff almost two years before he was even eligible to be drafted. His stuff just ticked up from there and arguably peaked the summer before his draft year, when Groome would work 92-96 mph in short stints, worked with an easy plus curveball, mixed in an average to above changeup, and did it with that big, athletic frame and starter's delivery, all of which led to being a first overall pick favorite at the time. But a myriad of concerns unrelated to Groome's talent dogged him more than most prep prospects. That, combined with a quickly thickening frame, contributed to his fall out of the top 10 picks of the 2016 draft. Since signing, Groome hasn't been on the mound much, making just 17 total pro starts due to a back injury and, eventually, Tommy John surgery. He's slated to return to the mound in June or July of 2019. Some scouts are still wary of his high school off-field issues and maxed-out frame, seeing a bunch of 50 or 55 attributes aside from his plus curveball. Those who are still on board not that his changeup was improving and his velo was regularly up to 96 mph prior to surgery, leading them to think that he was just getting back on track. Proponents expect him to pick up where he left off and reach the No. 2 or 3 starter upside he seemed to have at age 17.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","\"2016, 1st (12) - BOS\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 65 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  MLB Pipeline's top-rated prospect in the 2016 Draft, Groome lasted 12 picks amid severe signability and makeup concerns. Since signing for $3.65 million, a franchise record for a drafted pitcher, Groome was hampered by a lat strain and forearm soreness in his first full pro season and missed his second after having Tommy John surgery last May. Before he blew out his elbow, he was throwing as well as he had as a pro, fueling hopes that he was poised for a breakout year in 2018.  After working in the low 90s with his fastball while recording a 5.37 ERA during his first two years in pro ball, Groome sat in the mid-90s with armside run last spring. He also showed why scouts considered his curveball the best in the 2016 Draft, displaying a well above-average bender with power and depth. He has displayed feel for a changeup with some sink, but needs more time to refine it into a reliable third offering.  Though Groome has yet to throw consistent strikes as a pro, he has the athleticism and clean delivery to do so. His 6-foot-6 frame helps him create plane and angle with his pitches, making them more difficult to barrel. He won't turn 21 until late in the 2019 season and still has the upside of a frontline starter, but he has done little thus far to demonstrate he can reach that ceiling.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"A\"","10","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","4","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"54.2\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2450","40","55","45","55","","","","50","55","55","65","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","65","","","","","45","\"OAK\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["333","330","283","416","204","\"46.8\"","\"46.6\"","\"44.3\"","\"51.7\"","\"46.5\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","\"Sean\"","\"Hjelle\"","2019","\"22.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"83\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2422","663546","\"hjelle_sean\"","","\"sa3007989\"","\"|\"","","\"Kentucky\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","42","\"51af5JjxsT4\"","","\"Hjelle body comps to a young Pau Gasol and is remarkably athletic for his size.

Hjelle's (it's pronounced like peanut butter and _____ ) fastball only sits in the low-90s but plays up because of extension, life, and the angle created by his height. Those traits in concert with one another make for a heater that competes for whiffs in the zone. The secondaries are closer to average, often below, though Hjelle can locate them.

He has outstanding body control for someone his size, allowing him to repeat his delivery with ease and throw strikes with all of his offerings.  Hjelle's best pitch is his low-80s knuckle-curve, which earns plus grades from some evaluators. He also uses a cutter/slider to give him a harder breaking ball and shows feel for a changeup.

There, Newton outperformed even the most optimistic expectations, hitting .280/.408/.449 with 23 extra-base hits. Newton is much more of a physical marvel on which to dream than he is a polished performer. At a very projectable 6-foot-4, he's the size of an NFL wide receiver prospect and already has considerable raw power that projects to plus at maturity. It's rare for infielders this size to stay at shortstop, but Newton looks natural and comfortable there even though he clearly hasn't totally grown into his body yet and appears uncoordinated at other times. Even if he outgrows short, switch-hitting third basemen with power are extremely valuable. Newton has less bat control and feel to hit than his .280 batting average would otherwise indicate, and there's a chance he's always strikeout prone and doesn't get to some of his power. But it's unreasonable to expect a switch-hitting teenager this size to have fully sentient bat control, and the ceiling on Newton if everything actualizes is superstardom.

That success prompted the Mets to challenge Newton with an assignment to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his United States debut, and he responded by hitting for both average and power against advanced pitching, all while reaching base more than 40 percent of the time.   An athletic, switch-hitting, 6-foot-4 shortstop, Newton has shown a very advanced approach at the plate for a prospect his age, drawing a ton of walks and keeping his strikeout rate relatively low. With his mix of bat speed and strength, Newton has the physical tools needed to develop an above-average bat, though some evaluators do question his overall feel to hit, because his swing mechanics are inconsistent. He has plus raw power that he's already starting to get to, and given Newton's size, it's easy to dream on more as he matures.  Defensively, Newton has shown the hands, footwork and instincts -- not to mention the plus arm strength -- to potentially stay at shortstop, though it's reasonable to think he'll outgrow the position because his speed is presently fringy and because he has considerable physical projection remaining.

There's little precedent for hitters who K this much to have consistent success in the big leagues. Michael Taylor, Keon Broxton, Lewis Brinson, and Ian Happ are some examples of center fielders with power who strike out about that much, and they've had periods of ineffectiveness.   Of course, Peters' upside is enticing if he gets to his mammoth raw power anyway, which to this point, he has. This is predicated on him playing center field, which considering Peters is built like a young Adam Dunn, is no guarantee. He's a plus runner underway but it takes a while for him to reach top speed. Right now, that is more detrimental from home to first than it is roaming the outfield, but it's likely that a frame like this moves to a corner eventually. The Dodgers, who love Peters' work ethic, sent him back to Double-A for the second straight year. He may have hot stretches where he hits for tons of power, and ice ages when he strikes out a ton.

He topped the Rookie-level Pioneer League in runs (63), total bases (161) and OPS (1.052) during his pro debut, then encored by winning California League MVP honors and leading the Class A Advanced circuit in extra-base hits (61) and slugging (.514) during his first full season. He followed up in 2018 by pacing all Double-A hitters in homers (29) and the Texas League in extra-base hits (55) and total bases (232).  Compared to Jayson Werth for his power and surprising athleticism in a big frame, Peters can knock the ball out of any part of any ballpark thanks to his strength and leverage. His 6-foot-6 build comes with a naturally long right-handed swing that, coupled with his aggressive approach, resulted in a Texas League-worst 192 strikeouts and 34 percent whiff rate in 2018. He went through five different batting stances during the season as he searched for a way to make more contact, and the Dodgers think he'll be able to do that after reworking his stroke during the offseason.  Peters displays average speed out of the batter's box and is a step quicker once he gets going, which enabled him to play center field for the majority of his first three pro seasons.

The son of former big leaguer Phil Nevin missed nearly all of the 2016 season with hamstring issues, played in just 82 games in 2017 with a wrist injury and while he played well in the California League in 2018 and reached 100 games played for the first time in his career, a quad problem shelved him twice. He was due some good fortune and it came in the form of a minor Brendan Rodgers injury that kept the top Rockies prospect from going to the Arizona Fall League, allowing Nevin to step in and win the league's batting title.    Nevin has always shown the ability to hit for average. He has an advanced approach at the plate, showing a willingness to see pitches and a knack for barreling up the baseball. He drives the ball to the gaps and started to show his raw power in games more in 2018, though he's never one to sell out for home runs. A third baseman in high school and at the outset of his career, Nevin has seen more time at first than the hot corner, though he continues to get reps at both, including during his AFL stint. He has good hands and actions that point to being a solid defender at first.    The key for Nevin is simply to stay healthy. If he can do that, he can build off of his AFL success and attack the upper levels of the Rockies system.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","\"AA\"","6","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (COL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.5\"","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","40","50","35","40","50","55","45","55","35","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","40","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CLE\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["337","334","489","412","953","\"46.7\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.3\"","\"46.5\"","\"42.1\"","\"46.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jake\"","\"Rogers\"","2019","\"24.1\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1696","668670","\"rogers_jake\"","","\"sa874230\"","\"|\"","","\"Tulane\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2020","42","","","\"A polished receiver and cat-like ball-blocker with a laser arm, Rogers was one of this century's best defensive amateur backstops while at Tulane. He fell to round three of his draft because of concerns about his bat, concerns that turned out to be well-founded, as Rogers had stark contact issues last year when he was tested at Double-A and the Fall League. A pairing of patience and pull power probably provides Rogers with a shot to approach the low offensive bar at the catcher position. He might hit .220 but still yank out 15 annual homers, walk a bunch, and end up hitting well-enough to play every day for someone.

Originally a third-round pick by the Astros, Rogers proved more than a just a gifted defender as he turned in a strong offensive performance in his first full season. Looking like he might be the total package as dual-threat catcher, the Tigers acquired Rogers with Franklin Perez and Daz Cameron in the August 2017 blockbuster for Justin Verlander. Spending his first full season with the Tigers in Double-A, Rogers continued to showcase his defensive prowess but underwhelmed with the bat.   Rogers' stellar defense is his ticket to the big leagues, and there's a large contingent of scouts and executives that believe there's no one better in the Minors. He is an outstanding receiver and framer who is agile behind the plate and works well with pitchers. His plus, highly accurate arm and superb catch-and-throw skills enable him to shut down the running game, as he threw out 46 percent of attempted basestealers in his first full season followed by 56 percent (50 of 90) at Double-A Erie in 2018.  The leg kick in Rodgers' swing that served him well in 2017 detracted from his ability to hit in Double-A, where timing issues made him susceptible to good sequencing and resulted in too much swing-and-miss. When he did make contact, Rogers consistently hit the ball in the air, so there's reason to believe his above-average raw power will continue to play even if never hits for much average. Overall, it's the profile of at least a defensive-minded backup catcher in the big leagues, perhaps even a regular if he can unlock more of his potential with the bat.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"AAA\"","10","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"47.3\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","40","50","40","55","60","40","50","50","40","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","50","30","65","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["338","335","449","785","138","\"46.7\"","\"45.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"52.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"52.8\"","\"|\"","\"Parker\"","\"Dunshee\"","2019","\"24.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2799","670161","","","\"sa873274\"","\"|\"","","\"Wake Forest\"","0","2","","\"Low\"","2019","40","\"ZEfIrYUNSJY\"","","\"Dunshee flew under the radar at Wake Forest, opting not to sign his junior year as a 14th rounder, then going in the seventh round as a priority senior sign to Oakland in 2017.

But the 55s are showing up with a little more regularity, the command has gone from average to plus, and he knows exactly how to use the many pitches he has. Scouts think he's now a high probability back-end starter who outperforms his raw stuff in the minors and may continue to do so in the majors.

The Cubs took him in the 14th round of the 2016 Draft after that season, but Dunshee returned for his senior year. He may have been a money-saving senior sign in the seventh round in 2017, one who got a $25,000 bonus, but he sure hasn't pitched like one, winning the organizational pitching Triple Crown and reaching Double-A in his first full season.  Dunshee used a four-pitch array of largely average stuff to dominate across two levels in 2018. On paper, his fastball might be below-average, thrown typically around 90-91 mph. A combination of command and deception allows it to play up and he gets swings and misses on the pitch regularly. He'll flip in a curve for strike one early in counts, but it's his slider that flashes plus and serves as an out pitch. The A's made him throw his changeup more and it now gives him another Major League average offering. He's even started to develop a cutter.  The lack of pure stuff might limit Dunshee's ceiling to that of a No. 4 or 5 starter, but his ability to command four, or five, pitches and dominate, has everyone excited to see what he can do for an encore.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"AAA\"","16","\"2017 Draft Rnd 7 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"55.0\"","\"46.3\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2450","50","55","50","50","45","","","60","55","55","50","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","45","55","45","","","55","","",""],["339","336","419","521","299","\"46.7\"","\"45.2\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jairo\"","\"Solis\"","2019","\"19.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2071","672810","","","\"sa3003037\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","","","\"If not for a very unfortunately timed Tommy John -- which will keep him out until 2020 -- Solis would have been several spots higher on this list.

Solis also has a great arm for a 19-year-old and may still throw harder as he matures, with his fastball already sitting in the viable low-to-mid 90s. There's some changeup feel here, too, and teams think Solis has mid-rotation ceiling so long as his command continues to progress.

Solis went from working with an 89-91 mph fastball when he signed to sitting at 93-95 mph and touching 97 with late hop and cutting action when he got hurt. He could add more velocity because he still has physical projection remaining and Tommy John rehab often leaves pitchers stronger than ever. His hard slider has the potential to become a plus pitch and he also shows promising feel for his changeup.   His long arms allow Solis to create good extension and downhill plane on his pitches.

For one, he throws harder than most side-armers and will have outings where he sits comfortably in the 93-95 range with his fastball, while dropping down into the 91-94 range in others. He also throws an unusually high ratio of strikes for a bullpen arm; 70% of his 2018 fastballs went for strikes. In addition to his dastardly slider, Mills also has a pretty good changeup, which helps to mitigate platoon issues that might otherwise be worse given his arm slot. In our estimation, the strike-throwing and changeup give Mills a better chance of playing a high-leverage or multi-inning role than the other relief-only prospects in this system. A caveat here is that Mills did not throw on back-to-back days in 2018 and often had several days of rest between appearances, so we're not sure how his stuff might respond to the more varied usage necessitated by the big league environment.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2017, 3rd (93) - SEA\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  Under the current Draft rules, it's become common for teams to pick college seniors in the top 10 rounds and sign them for under pick value in order to aggressively go after tougher-to-sign talent. Signing Mills as a third-rounder in 2017 following a senior season at Gonzaga that saw him save 12 games and post an ERA well below 2.00 for more than $450,000 under slot allowed the Mariners to go above value to sign a pitcher like Sam Carlson, for example. But Mills is turning out to be more than just a money-saver, using his stuff and funky delivery to get to Double-A in his first full season.  Mills did struggle when he reached Double-A in 2018, but there is every expectation he'll make the adjustments necessary, especially after a successful stint in the Arizona Fall League following the season. He uses a low three-quarters slot and will have to develop a changeup for left-handed hitters. He'll also have to deviate from always using his low-90s sinking fastball and ride it in on right-handed hitters to give them a different look. Analytically minded folks love Mills, who has high spin rates on both the fastball and his tight slider that serves as a swing and miss pitch, especially against right-handed hitters, and he routinely finds the strike zone.  It might seem like Mills profiles best as a right-on-right specialist or more of a sixth- or seventh-inning reliever. But the same was said about Steve Cishek, whom Mills is often compared to, and Cishek has 125 career saves entering the 2019 season.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AA\"","15","\"2017 Draft Rnd 3 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"52.5\"","\"56.7\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2050","2550","50","60","45","","60","","","55","60","55","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","","","60","","","","50","","",""],["341","338","344","354","727","\"46.7\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Chavis\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","180","4","\"|\"","811","656308","\"chavis_michael\"","17321","\"sa828673\"","\"|\"","","\"Sprayberry HS (GA)\"","-1","2","","\"Med\"","2019","45","\"eaAbGhTyWvg\"","","\"Chavis was a well-known Atlanta-area prep prospect, who in high school was a strong statistical performer with easy plus raw power that showed up in games. He didn't have a clear positional fit as an amateur, and that's still mostly the case now--he was a shortstop in high school but wasn't an athletic fit there, tried catching but it didn't work, and scouts generally projected third base or first base long term. Though he has mostly played third, pro scouts see Chavis as a first base-only type, and he started seeing time there during the 2017 Fall League and again late in 2018. He missed much of 2018 with an 80-game PED suspension, which ominously came after a breakout 2017 campaign during which he hit 31 homers. He has now reached Triple-A, and had a strong half-season after the suspension was up, but scouts are wary of being all-in on a player whose entire profile is dependent on power and has also had a recent PED suspension. One-dimensional hitters who are limited on defense tend to end up in a first base platoon (and in this case, it'd be the lesser side of one) or as a low-end starter like Kevin Millar. Either way, it seems unlikely a high-payroll, contending club like Boston would wait for a young player with limited upside to break in as an everyday player. We think Chavis is a low-end regular and that he may be trade bait once he further establishes his level of performance post-suspension.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"MLB\"","3","\"2014 Draft Rnd 1 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.4\"","\"48.2\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","50","65","40","40","55","40","55","65","40","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TEX\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["342","339","327","522","62","\"46.7\"","\"46.0\"","\"42.9\"","\"53.7\"","\"43.4\"","\"54.6\"","\"|\"","\"Richard\"","\"Gallardo\"","2019","\"17.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"187\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2316","682620","","","","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","42","\"j7EwIoPixuw\"","","\"Gallardo signed for an even $1 million in July and was, in our opinion, the most well-rounded pitcher in his IFA class.

Gallardo also has a proclivity for spin and his curveball already flashes plus. He checks all the traditional boxes for a teenage pitching prospect, has advanced pitchability, and his stuff works in a specific way (four-seamers up, curveballs down) that fits with contemporary pitch usage.

The Cubs signed him on the first day of the signing period, giving the Venezuelan a $1 million bonus. He's advanced enough that he could come to the United States for his pro debut this year.  Gallardo offers both projection and polish. He already works at 89-93 mph with his four-seam fastball, and his arm speed and potential to add strength mean that he could throw harder in the future. His curveball has good shape and, like his heater, could become a plus offering as he adds more power.  Gallardo's feel for a changeup and his ability to command his repertoire are unusual for a teenager. He has a clean delivery and repeats it well, which bodes well for his long-term durability. While he's several years away from the big leagues, he has one of the higher ceilings among Chicago's pitching prospects and a better chance to reach it than most of them.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","","10","\"2018 J2 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"41.7\"","\"56.7\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","0.0000","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","35","50","40","55","","","","55","55","50","70","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","55","","","","","50","","",""],["343","340","328","355","565","\"46.7\"","\"46.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.0\"","\"42.7\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Luis\"","\"Medina\"","2019","\"20.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","2226","665622","","","\"sa928510\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","-1","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"CULpv2BOf-0\"","","\"Medina was up to 96 mph as an 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2nd due in part to 20 command. Then he hit 100 mph as an amateur with improved feel, which is when the Yankee scooped him up for $300,000. He was the highest variance player on last year's version of this list and is once again. The pure stuff hasn't change and it's top of the line: a 95-97 mph heater that has hit 101 mph, a power curveball that's anywhere from 60 to 70 depending on the day, and a changeup that flashes 55 or 60 at its best. His command is now a 30 that we project to be a 40. But he's still a teenager, so there's a chance that things click for him and he finds 45 command and 50 control, which would be the minimum to stick as a starter with this kind of stuff. Medina's issues aren't physical -- his delivery is fine and his arm stroke is clean. Instead, the problem appears to be mostly mental. He'll throw well in the bullpen, only to have things will snowball for him in game situations. One source described his issues as stemming from a need for greater mental maturity and to not be so hard on himself, which are exactly the kinds of traits that come with general social maturity. That said, this sort of stuff rarely comes with starter command, so Medina is probably either a high-wire act reliever with bonkers stuff or a starter with the stuff ratcheted down a bit, similar to what Touki Toussaint has done the last couple seasons.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"July 8, 2015 - NYY\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  There may not be a prospect in baseball with a bigger gap between his ceiling and floor than Medina.

He logged a 6.25 ERA with 46 walks in 36 innings while repeating the Rookie-level Appalachian League last season.  Medina has electric arm speed that generates 95-100 mph fastballs with little effort, peaking at 102 with some cutting action. His high-spin curveball gives him a second plus-plus pitch at its best, combining power in the low 80s with sharp break. His low-90s changeup has splitter action and gives him a third weapon that can make hitters look silly.   Medina is athletic and has no glaring flaws in his delivery, helping his chances of developing at least the decent command he'll need to succeed. Some observers believe his strike-throwing issues are more mental than physical. He has the upside of a frontline starter with a more realistic expectation of becoming a difference-making reliever, and the Yankees will give him plenty of time to figure things out.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A\"","13","\"2015 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"41.7\"","\"50.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","1.7500","0.1667","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2550","2300","30","60","45","55","","","","40","65","55","65","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","55","60","","","","","40","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["344","341","305","413","312","\"46.7\"","\"46.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.6\"","\"48.0\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Shaun\"","\"Anderson\"","2019","\"24.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1784","641312","\"anderson_shaun\"","19453","\"sa739018\"","\"|\"","","\"Florida\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","42","","","\"Anderson has an unusually deep repertoire for a pitcher who scouts overwhelmingly project into the bullpen.

A casualty of Florida's ability to recruit and develop pitching, Anderson was a college reliever who would've been starting on just about every other college team in the country, so there's a reason he lacks some of the finer attributes scout want to see from a starter.

In his first full season with the Giants after coming to them along with right-hander Gregory Santos in exchange for Eduardo Nunez in July 2017, he developed into the system's top mound prospect, pitched in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game and reached Triple-A.  Though he was stuck in the bullpen in college, Anderson has a mix of five effective pitches. He gets a lot of groundouts with his fastball, which sits at 91-94 mph and peaks at 96 with impressive sink and angle. His best secondary offering is a late-breaking mid-80s slider than he can turn into a upper-80s cutter when he wants.  Anderson also has a sinking, fading changeup that counteracts left-handers and a curveball to give hitters a softer, different look.

But the heat that emanates from him right arm is among the best in the minors. He'll routinely sit 97-99 and has touched as high as 103 (the slo-mo pitch in the linked video was 100 mph). It's a blistering, elite pitch that had upper-level hitters taking flaccid, defeated swings this spring, and has helped Muoz strike out two hitters per inning early on in 2019.   He has yet to harness the fastball and throw consistent strikes (he's walking a batter per inning, too) and his breaking ball quality is also inconsistent. If both of those issues improve, Muoz will be an elite relief option. If one of them does, he's probably still a high-leverage arm, just one who makes you sweat after surrendering a couple of walks. If neither do, then Muoz will go the way of some other recent fastball-only prospects like this, such as Thyago Vieira and Mauricio Cabrera.\"","\"|\"","","\"SD\"","","\"July 7, 2015 - SD\"","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 40 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Hailing from the same Mexican League team that produced Luis Urias and Tirso Ornelas, Munoz received a $700,000 bonus in 2015, the largest bonus handed out by the Padres in the 2015-16 international period (before their massive spending spree a year later). Thus far, he's been worth every penny, as he's risen quickly through the Minor League ranks. Munoz burst into national consciousness in the 2017 Arizona Fall League, where, as the circuit's youngest player, he pitched to a 1.04 ERA, allowing just four hits while striking out 11 in 8 2/3 innings. An elbow injury limited Munoz at the outset of the '18 season. But he returned in mid-June as the same flame-throwing right-hander, and he made the jump to Double-A two weeks later.  The epitome of a power reliever, Munoz owns the best fastball in San Diego's system and is one of the hardest throwers in the Minor Leagues. He offered a glimpse at that impressive velocity in the AFL, where he consistently pumped upper-90s heat and was up to 101 mph with a fastball that showed explosive late life. His hard slider in the upper 80s gives Munoz a second dynamic offering, one that's gotten better the more he's thrown it.  The biggest issue with Munoz's continues to be his control. In his 25 appearances in 2018, he allowed more walks (13) than hits (11). Munoz's high-effort delivery and issues in repeating his arm slot mean he's still got work left in front of him. But with even modest improvement on that front, Munoz be on the fast track to becoming a closer in the Major Leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"AAA\"","23","\"2015 J2 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","21","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"52.0\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","2.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2450","30","80","","","55","","","40","80","","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","80","40","","50","","","","40","","",""],["346","343","448","518","375","\"46.6\"","\"45.1\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.1\"","\"44.9\"","\"50.6\"","\"|\"","\"Lyon\"","\"Richardson\"","2019","\"19.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"192\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2442","680689","\"richardson_lyon\"","","\"sa3007727\"","\"|\"","","\"Jensen Beach HS (FL)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","\"A6viDU8LwwU\"","","\"Richardson was an intriguing two-way athlete on the showcase circuit, then hit 97 mph repeatedly early in his draft spring and moved into top two round contention.

Converted from outfielder to pitcher during his senior year in the Port St. Lucie area of Florida, Richardson hit 97 mph with his fastball ahead of the 2018 Draft. But during his first pro exposure at Rookie-level Greeneville, the right-hander did not display his best velocity on his fastball or breaking ball and rarely threw his slider.

He's athletic for his size but perhaps not exceptionally athletic in a vacuum, his forearms appear shorter than is typical for someone his size, and his stride home is very abbreviated.

Yes, he missed development time on the mound by being out for all of 2018, but the strength and conditioning that went along with rehabbing the injury could help him take a big step when he returns to the mound.  Before Aquino went down with injury, he had already improved strength-wise enough to add velocity to his fastball. What was a 90-91 mph heater when he first signed was touching 96 mph at instructs in the fall of 2017 with excellent spin and riding life. He's filled out even more now, so dreaming about more velocity once he gets his feet under him isn't unrealistic. He can really spin his breaking ball, giving him the chance for a second plus pitch, and he'll continue to work on what could be a decent changeup.   With his size, Aquino will have to work at repeating his delivery.

A terrific on-mound athlete built like an NFL quarterback, Hanifee relies heavily on a sinking mid-90s fastball. The rest of his profile is pretty raw. He doesn't have great natural feel for spin, and it probably behooves him and the Orioles to focus on changeup development if his mediocre strikeout rate is going to climb. But the sinker, and high-volume strike throwing ability, provide the foundation for an innings-eating backend starter at the least, and you can feel free to project heavily on much of the rest of Hanifee's profile because of his prototypical frame and athleticism, though it's becoming more evident that spin isn't a teachable quality. There's risk Hanifee is forced into the bullpen due to the lack of repertoire depth, but if his velo ticks up in max-effort, single-innings stints, he could be dominant.

High, Hanifee blossomed on the mound as a senior before going to the Orioles in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. He signed for slightly above slot value, forgoing his commitment to Eastern Carolina. While a minor back injury prompted the Orioles to delay his pro debut until 2017, Hanifee showed no ill effects as he posted a 2.75 ERA, second among Baltimore farmhands, in the New York-Penn League. He built upon that progress at Class A Delmarva in his first full season, finishing among the top five in the circuit in both ERA (2.86) and innings pitched (132).     Hanifee compensates for his lack of a true plus offering by demonstrating advanced feel for his craft. His arsenal is centered on a bowling-ball fastball that registers at 91-94 mph with exceptional late sinking action that has helped him to record ground-ball rates of 58 and 55 percent in his first two seasons, respectively. Hanifee's low-80s slider flashes above average, and he has good feel for locating, and he rounds out his arsenal with a changeup that plays nicely off his fastball and has average potential. Everything he throws plays up on account of his advanced pitchability and command.  Tall and athletic with projection remaining, Hanifee has a smooth delivery, clean arm action and uses his height to his advantage, consistently creating angle to the plate.

Breaking balls especially flummox him, even when they hang and appear hittable. Mike Olt, Juan Francisco, Matt Davidson, and Pedro Alvarez are recent examples of players with offensive skills who struggled to overcome their issues with strikeouts. But Dalbec is also more athletic than most of those low-contact, corner sluggers, and looked great at third base during the Fall League. Realistically, Dalbec's issues limit him to a bench or platoon role, largely enabled by his ability to play third base well. But because there's superlative power here, the ceiling is sky high if things suddenly click with the bat. Dalbec also spent time pitching in college (he was 91-93 with an average slider), a secondary skill that is of increasing interest to teams, though it's still just largely considered to be a parlor trick to show off during a blowout.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","\"2016, 4th (118) - BOS\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 60 | Run: 40 | Arm: 65 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Dalbec entered 2016 with Kris Bryant comparisons and a chance to go early in the first round, but he slumped as an Arizona junior and actually performed better on the mound, leading all pitchers with 41 strikeouts during the NCAA Division I tournament. The Red Sox still bought into his power potential and signed him for an over-slot $650,000 bonus in the fourth round. An old hamate injury ruined his first full pro season, but he bounced back in 2018 to rank second in the Minors in extra-base hits (70) and RBIs (109), and fourth in homers (32).  Dalbec comes with serious pop and serious swing-and-miss concerns -- as evidenced by his .301 Isolated Power and 32-percent strikeout rate last season. Few prospects anywhere have more raw power, which he creates with an impressive combination of bat speed, strength and launch angle, not to mention an extremely aggressive approach. He shows some patience to draw walks and is at his best when he uses the middle of the field, though he often sells out for home runs, lengthens his right-handed swing and chases pitches out of the zone.  While Dalbec has below-average speed, he has worked hard to make himself into a solid defender at third base. His range is ordinary, but he has good hands and a strong arm that delivered low-90s fastballs and effective sliders in college.

After dominating the DSL during the summer, Flores got a late call-up and played two games in the GCL before his summer was shortened by a minor injury. He reminds some scouts of a potential everyday shortstop who takes a few games to grow on you. Unlike many high-bonus, July 2nd prospects, Flores doesn't have loud, flashy tools, or exceptional twitch or physical projection. He's more of the steady, low-key type of player with excellent feel for defense (common among prospects from Venezuela, where there's more of a game-focused development) and high-quality contact. He projects to be an above-average bat with average raw power, and the swing attributes to have a chance to get to most of it. Deceptively quick for his size, Flores has average speed and the defensive instincts to cover more ground than his raw foot speed indicates, as well as a plus arm. There's a chance Flores outgrows shortstop, but he'd likely be at least above-average, if not plus, at third base in that event. It may be a card full of 5's (except for arm strength) on the 2-8 scale, with very little pro experience, but scouts are excited about what little they've seen here and think he could be a first division regular if the bat develops enough.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - BOS\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Boston gave seven-figure bonuses to three Venezuelans in 2017: catcher Daniel Flores ($3.1 million), who died of cancer four months later; and infielders Flores ($1.4 million) and Danny Diaz ($1.6 million), who quickly emerged as two of the best position prospects in a rebuilding farm system. Flores was advanced enough offensively and defensively to make his U.S. debut at age 17 last summer, though he missed six weeks after straining his left shoulder on a swing. One rival club told the Red Sox they considered him the best prospect in the organization.  With a controlled but quick right-handed swing and an advanced approach for a teenager, Flores should hit for a high average. He controls the strike zone and employs the entire field, and his hitting ability and deceptive strength give him the chance to develop 20-homer power. While he's only an average runner and could lose a half-step as he matures physically, he has good instincts on the bases.  Flores also shows nice savvy in the field, where he covers more ground at shortstop than his speed might suggest.

It's a testament to Walls' breakout 2018 season that he's even in that conversation, as many scouts thought the Rays had drastically overdrafted him in the third round out of Florida State in 2017. Walls played second base in college and had an all-fields, spray approach with little power but excellent pitch selection and plate discipline. He was getting pegged as a non-impact type, the sort of backup second baseman the likes of which teams don't carry anymore; his best ability (pitch selection) wasn't even a tool, and it didn't matter much if he didn't have any power. Most of that changed in 2018 as the Rays' strategy of drafting players projected as second baseman and seeing if they can play shortstop worked out, with Clay Davenport's defensive metrics grading Walls at +16 runs over 103 games, about as high of a number as you'll see in the minor leagues. Scouts tended to agree that Walls was above average at the position, more due to angles and instincts than raw tools, and this development seemed to surprise even the Rays. Offensively, Walls started driving the ball more and doing some extra base damage when he was getting into good counts. The raw tools are still mostly average and he was 22 years old in Low-A, a function of the Rays' middle infield depth blocking a deserved promotion, so there isn't amazing upside here. That said, a player many scouts thought was an overdraft now looks like he has a solid shot to turn into a good utility guy or low-end regular just 18 months later.\"","\"|\"","","\"TB\"","\"2017, 3rd (79) - TB\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  The last time Florida State had a shortstop who garnered early-round consideration was in 2004, when Stephen Drew was in the conversation for the No. 1 overall pick and ended up going No. 15 overall to Arizona. Walls didn't rate that highly ahead of the 2017 Draft, but his track record of success and the fact that college shortstop performers always do well in the Draft earned him a third-round selection by Tampa Bay. Walls continued to perform at Class A Bowling Green in his first full season, when he ranked among the Midwest League leaders in average (.304, fifth), hits (142, third), on-base pct.

After compiling more walks (178) than strikeouts (145) during his 196-game college career, Walls posted 66 walks against 80 strikeouts at Bowling Green. He's a switch-hitter who grinds out at-bats, with a line-drive approach and some extra-base ability, albeit with below-average over-the-fence power. An above-average runner with strong instincts, he tied for second in the organization with 31 stolen bases. While he's not a flashy defender, Walls makes all the plays at shortstop, with arm strength and range that both grade as a tick above average. He was named the Defensive Player of the Year by the Rays Baseball Operations department last season and should be able to stay up the middle long-term, either at short or second base.

He makes heavy use of a hard slider that at times looks like a cutter. It has enough movement to miss bats if Stephan leaves it in the zone and he's been able to back foot it to lefties. Changeup development is paramount, and a fair number of scouts think Stephan ends up in the bullpen both because his change is quite a bit behind the typical 23-year-old's and because he throws exclusively from the stretch. While that's a possibility, the way Stephan's delivery enables his stuff to play up could make him viable in a multi-inning role. He reached Double-A in 2018 and has a chance to debut in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","\"2017, 3rd (92) - NYY\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Stephan saw more action at first base than on the mound in high school and didn't become a full-time pitcher until he got to Hill (Texas) Junior College. He transitioned from relieving to starting after transferring to Arkansas in 2017, when he led the Southeastern Conference in strikeout rate (11.9 per nine innings) and pitched his way into the third round. He has advanced quicker than expected in pro ball, reaching Double-A 11 months after signing.  Stephan relies heavily on his fastball, which gets a heavy dose of swings and misses within the strike zone. He sits at 90-95 mph and touches 97 with significant running action that comes from his deceptive crossfire and uphill delivery. After struggling to develop a curveball, he scrapped it and had more success with a slider/cutter that has high spin rates.  His changeup is more of a work in progress after he relied mostly on his fastball in college, and it wasn't as effective once he got to Double-A. He usually throws strikes and commands his fastball to both sides of the plate, though he struggled more than usual to locate his pitches after his promotion. There are some questions as to whether his delivery and arm action are suitable for starting every fifth day, but the Yankees envision him eventually claiming a spot in the middle of their rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"AA\"","14","\"2017 Draft Rnd 3 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"52.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2500","40","60","40","","55","","","50","60","45","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","","55","","","","50","","",""],["353","350","273","195","675","\"46.6\"","\"46.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"48.4\"","\"41.2\"","\"49.1\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Vilade\"","2019","\"20.3\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"194\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2092","668723","\"vilade_ryan\"","","\"sa3004256\"","\"|\"","","\"Stillwater HS (OK)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","","","\"Vilade has not developed as expected to this point.

After a strong summer debut, Vilade really struggled out of the gate during his full-season debut in 2018, but righted the ship with a .310/.370/.419 second half.  Vilade's ability to shake off a terrible start in the South Atlantic League as a teenager speaks volumes about his ability to learn and make adjustments as a hitter. He has a tremendous feel to hit with excellent bat speed and a quick swing from the right side of the plate. There's a lot of raw power to tap into, with the chance for Vilade to eventually have plus pop that he'll get to thanks to his approach. While few doubt he'll hit, there is more question about what position he ultimately plays. The Rockies like moving infielders around during development, doing it with top prospect Brendan Rodgers, for example, and Vilade will do the same moving forward after only playing shortstop in his first year-plus as a pro.  Vilade will have the opportunity to stay at shortstop, but given that he's already bigger and stronger than he was when last season ended, it's easy to see him outgrowing the position. He could slide over to third or across to second full-time in the future. One thing the Rockies love about positional flexibility is that it will be easier to get Vilade's potent bat into a big league lineup once he's ready.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","\"A+\"","5","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (COL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.6\"","\"49.1\"","\"48.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","55","45","45","55","50","40","60","40","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","45","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"STL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["354","351","547","783","332","\"46.5\"","\"44.3\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.4\"","\"46.9\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Jimmy\"","\"Lambert\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2794","669424","","","\"sa918003\"","\"|\"","","\"Fresno State\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","","","\"Lambert's strikeout rate exploded from 16% in 2017 to nearly 29% in 2018.

It also creates more vertical action on his breaking stuff.

He blossomed into a fifth-round choice out of Fresno State in 2016, when he shared Mountain West Conference pitcher of the year honors. He ascended to Double-A two years after turning pro and pitched well in five starts there before getting shut down with an oblique injury last July.  Lambert succeeds by mixing four pitches that all grade from average to solid. He has added some spin and riding action to his fastball, which sits at 91-94 mph and tops out at 96. His 12-to-6 curveball is his most reliable secondary pitch, while his fading changeup helps him against left-handers and he can land his lateral-breaking slider for strikes.  Lambert's athleticism helps him repeat his delivery and provide consistent strikes. He doesn't have much margin for error and helps his cause by being stingy with walks and home runs.

But in 2018 at Triple-A Louisville, he was employed mainly in a set-up role, pitching well enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.  Herget has an often deceptive three-quarters delivery that enables him to hide the ball well. Able to throw up to 97 mph, he can also keep hitters guessing by changing arm angles and tempo or shortening his stride. Unless he develops his below-average and seldom-used changeup, he could have time managing left-handed hitters in the big leagues. He could temper that with by burying a backdoor slider in on lefties.  While he certainly has the mentality to be a big-league closer with a delivery not unlike Steve Cishek or Kent Tekulve, his stuff projects as a likely better fit as a middle reliever or right-handed matchup specialist.

At that point, Hankins was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater, a new, but already plus slider, and an at least average changeup that he didn't need to use much. He looked a little rusty early during his senior spring, then walked off the mound with tightness in a shoulder muscle tied behind the joint. He returned over a month later and threw hard down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs.   He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games last spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for it anymore. At various points Hankins has utilized either a slider or curveball, and each looks good a few times a start but not often enough to project it as an impact pitch. He was noticeably thicker during the 2018 summer and continued having issues throwing quality breaking balls. Once a likely top 10 pick, he's now a bounce back hopeful.\"","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","\"2018, 1C (35) - CLE\"","","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Hankins entered 2018 with a chance to become the first high school right-hander selected No. 1 overall, but that ended when he missed a month during the spring with tightness in his shoulder. The Indians used their second of two first-round picks to grab him, signing him for an over-slot $2,246,022 as the 35th overall choice. Though Cleveland held him to three innings in his pro debut, his shoulder issue was determined to be muscular in nature and he's expected to have no restrictions in 2019.  When fully healthy, Hankins had the best fastball in the 2018 Draft, operating at 92-96 mph and reaching 98 with electric life and the ability to spot it to both sides of the plate. His fading changeup has the potential to become a plus offering, though his breaking pitches still need work. His hard curveball has its moments and he also has begun using a slider, but both were fringy for much of his high school senior season.  Hankins generates his premium fastball with little effort in his delivery, which bodes well for his future health and command. He'll vary his tempo to throw off hitters' timing, at times throwing in a Johnny Cueto-like shimmy.

His fastball plays because he hides the ball well, it has some life at the top of the zone, and he works it up around the hands of righties, causing significant discomfort. His command enables his milquetoast breaking ball to play, but his dastardly changeup, which Armenteros uses against hitters of both handedness, is clearly his best pitch. The deception may not play multiple times through a batting order if Armenteros ends up in a traditional starting role.

A finesse right-hander who has climbed steadily through the system, he led Houston farmhands in ERA (2.04) and strikeouts (146) in 2017 and went a combined 16-2 in Triple-A in 2017-18. He continued to perform well in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason yet may face a third season in Triple-A.  While Armenteros only has one pitch that grades better than average, he has thrived because his tumbling changeup and his feel for sequencing and locating his entire repertoire keeps hitters off balance. He changes eye levels with sinking 88-90 mph two-seam fastballs and riding 90-92 mph four-seamers, and he has hit 95 mph at times. His average slider/cutter and fringy curveball rarely buckle knees but he utilizes them well off each other.  Armenteros falls off the mound toward first base in his delivery, though that provides deception without compromising his ability to throw strikes.

He made his stateside debut just before his 17th birthday and walked just six hitters in 50 innings all summer. So Santos has rare size, precocious velocity, and control, though much of the rest of the profile has room for improvement. He exhibits neither notable raw spin nor feel for locating his current breaking ball,  a low-80s slurve. There's a strong chance Santos tries several iterations of various breaking balls during the course of his development and the one(s) he ends up with will probably look much different than what he's currently using. At this point in his development, we just care about the raw spin, a trait of limited malleability, and Santos' is just okay. It's reasonable to hope he grows into elite velocity. The fact that he's throwing this hard at this age and at this size is encouraging, though he's less projectable than one would probably assume given his age and height. All talk of Santos' physical progression centers around reshaping his current frame rather than just adding mass, as he's already pretty filled out. This clouds the fastball projection somewhat, but he'll probably still end up throwing really hard. There's need for significant development throughout the rest of the repertoire, and it's more likely that a portion of that happens (resulting in a back-of-the rotation or bullpen role) than it is that all of it does (resulting in stardom).

Santos, on the other hand, received a $275,000 bonus that's already looking like a bargain for the Mets after the teenage right-hander finished his professional debut at 17 in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League.   Long and lanky, Santos has grown since he signed and now stands at 6-foot-8. Unlike many young pitchers of that size, however, he has a very good delivery and knows how to command his developing three-pitch mix. Using a high three-quarter slot, Santos fills up the strike zone with a fastball that sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph. It has riding life because he generates huge extension toward the plate, while all signs point to the big right-hander adding more velocity to his plus fastball. When he signed with the Mets, Santos didn't have a breaking ball, but he has quickly gotten a good feel for a slider that he throws with power and depth, giving it the look of a future out pitch. His changeup is below average right now, but with his feel for pitching, the Mets are confident it will come on as a third effective offering.  Santos' tantalizing combination of youth, size and plus command all point to a career as a strike-throwing starting pitcher, possibly even one who pitches near the front of a big league rotation.

His success carried over to his junior season, while his profile as a college performer only boosted his stock as the Draft approached. The Rays ended up taking Frank in the second round and then saved money by signing him for under slot value. Sent to the New York-Penn League, Frank led the league with a .425 on-base percentage and ranked eighth with a .288 average.   Scouts see a future solid, albeit unspectacular, everyday type big leaguer when they watch Frank, in a sort of Mark Ellis type of mold.

Montero is a scaled-down version of Miguel Sano. His swing is mechanically similar and he, too, has a power-driven profile undercut by a thick frame that may not stay at third base despite plenty of arm. Montero's raw power and natural feel for lifting the basebal in the air may not be statistically evident next season due to Palm Beach's hitting environment, so don't worry if he's not posting a huge SLG% next year. Focus should instead be on Montero's approach (which is a little aggressive for some) and how mobile he's able to stay.

It reflected their belief in his pure hitting ability, and he's rewarded the organization by raking early in his career. After two summers playing in the Dominican Summer League, Montero was one of the better performers in the Gulf Coast League during his United States debut in 2017. He broke out in earnest in his first full season, earning Class A Midwest League MVP honors after he led the circuit in batting average (.322), slugging (.529) and OPS (.910), before finishing his age-19 campaign with Class A Advanced Palm Beach.  Montero has all the qualities teams look for when projecting a future impact hitter in the big leagues. He has a compact stroke that allows him to stay inside the ball and make a ton of loud, barreled contact. It translates to plus raw power that already plays in games to his pull side, and given his remaining physical projection, there surely will be more to come. He has a solid, if somewhat aggressive, approach at the plate and isn't afraid to draw walks. His best defensive tool is his arm, and the Cardinals think he has the hands and actions to stay at third base long term.  Others think he might outgrow the hot corner because his speed, range and footwork are all fringy. The good news is that if his bat continues to progress, he should have the offensive profile for either infield corner, with the potential to hit for a solid average while contributing 25-plus home runs from the middle of a lineup.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","6","\"2015 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","3","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"50.9\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","55","40","40","55","50","55","60","40","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","40","60","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CLE\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["361","358","361","406","390","\"46.4\"","\"45.6\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"38.5\"","\"51.1\"","\"|\"","\"Parker\"","\"Meadows\"","2019","\"19.6\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2420","678009","\"meadows_parker\"","","\"sa3007943\"","\"|\"","","\"Grayson HS (GA)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","","","\"The younger brother of Rays outfielder Austin Meadows, Parker has some similarities to his big league sibling, but his tools are actually compared more often to those of Indians center fielder Bradley Zimmer.

One pro scout we spoke with saw Llovera once early, when he was into the upper-90's with a plus-flashing breaking ball, then saw him later with the same heater and the plus-flashing splitter, only this time, he wasn't throwing the breaking ball much. That scout said if all three elements were together at once, it would be something like Kelvin Herrera (who was a 55 or 60 PV/FV at his peak). There's some obvious risk that Llovera's stuff plays below it's peak 2018 showings, that his command is a bit below average, and that his size limits him to multi-inning relief, in which case he's more of a 40 or 45 FV reliever who dazzles at times. He probably isn't a 180 inning starter, but Llovera will be one to watch early in 2019 to see what sort of stuff he's showing. He could be the next Phillies Latin power arm to be moved to relief who then shoots to the big leagues after Seranthony Dominguez, Edubray Ramos and Victor Arano.

He had an extreme spine tilt at this point, bending his upper body at an almost 45-degree angle toward first base when he released the ball, but his breaking ball was above average and his strike-throwing wasn't bad. As he entered pro ball, the Tigers worked on fixing this posture issue as they saw their first rounder as a potential mid-rotation starter. Since then, his stuff has ranged from being flat to regressing a bit. We can't say the lower effort is directly leading to the stuff not holding, but some pitchers have to dial things back a bit to pitch like a starter needs to and Burrows appears to be one of them.   As many power prep arms learning to become starters do, Burrows' breaker has become closer to average while his changeup is now the superior pitch (Ian Anderson is another example) and the upside is now more of a fourth starter.

Returning to the Eastern League in 2018, Burrows garnered honors as a midseason All-Star and once again showed he could handle a heavy workload as he logged at least 26 starts and 134 innings for a second straight season.   Burrows' four-pitch arsenal is headlined by a plus fastball that sits in the low 90s and consistently touches the mid-90s. He throws the pitch with good life down in the zone, allowing him to miss bats, though it does flatten out when elevated. Burrows' secondary stuff still needs refinement, but he can spin a very good curve, added a slider and has made enough progress in developing his changeup that it's now considered an above-average pitch.   Burrows is still learning how to consistently repeat his delivery, and the hope is that with further refinement he'll be able to develop average control.

If scouts were convinced that Davidson will hit with wood, he'd likely be the first college shortstop drafted in June.

One could point to his age (Rutherford was as old as a junior college prospect on draft day) as an indicator that should have been tempered our expectations of his power growth in the first place. But really, Rutherford's swing, while picturesque, is just geared for all-fields doubles. He has some low-ball, home run power to his pull side, but otherwise does damage peppering the gaps and third baseline. Half of his 2018 doubles were struck to left of center field.

The White Sox acquired him in July 2017 as the headliner in a four-player package for Todd Frazier, David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle.  Rutherford still impresses scouts with his smooth left-handed swing, pitch-recognition skills and willingness to use the entire field. He makes repeated contact and club officials believe he could start to hit for more power in 2019 after adding strength in the offseason. He has the size, strength and bat speed to produce 20 homers per season if he can stop hitting so many ground balls (1.85 groundout/airout ratio in 2018) and drive the ball more consistently.  Compared to the likes of Andre Ethier and David Justice, Rutherford could have at least average tools across the board when he's fully developed.

He is very slight of build, so much so that there's skepticism regarding his power projection that there is not for other players of similar age, skill, and level (like Brayan Rocchio with Cleveland), who have a better chance of developing pop.

Named for the town of Tucupita, where he's from in Venezuela, Marcano signed for $320,000. He made his full-season debut by splitting time between the Arizona Rookie League and short-season Class A Tri-City in 2018. Marcano batted .366/.450/.438, while showcasing some of the most advanced knowledge of the strike zone in the organization; he struck out 16 times and walked 30.  Marcano is a slender and wiry middle-infield type, who needs to fill out his 6-foot frame. When he does, he could grow into some power. But his contact skills are the defining characteristic. Marcano's short left-handed stroke produces line drives all over the field, and he has a knack for hard contact. He complements his excellent plate approach with above-average speed, though he still needs to hone his base-stealing.   Defensively, the Padres are convinced Marcano can remain at shortstop, and he's got the quick hands necessary to be a solid defender. His arm projects as merely average, and in a Padres system loaded with shortstop options, that could force a move to second base.

In his two full Minor League seasons, Lawson has yet to find any measure of consistency, with an ERA hovering around 5. But all the while, he's continued to flash promising stuff and a high ceiling.

Like Soriano, Ruiz has pole-to-pole power and feel for striking the ball in the air to all fields, he is similarly built, and he shares some mechanical traits with Soriano, though not the signature, one-handed finish. He's also not a good defensive infielder, and is so mistake-prone that there's a real possibility that Ruiz eventually moves to the outfield. He runs well enough to give center field a go if that becomes the case, but such a move is probably premature until or unless Ruiz's offensive performance forces a change so his glove can be ready when the bat is.   The Padres acquired Ruiz from Kansas City in a 2017 six-player swap (Strahm, Wood, Ruiz for Cahill, Maurer, Buchter) just 21 games into his stateside pro debut. Then they skipped him over advanced rookie ball and sent him to Low-A the following spring. The Midwest League is tough on hitters and Ruiz's line was, in context, pretty good. His aggressive approach may start to be exploited at Hi-A, but once Ruiz gets his footing he could break out statistically.\"","\"|\"","","\"SD\"","","\"July 3, 2015 - KC\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  Signed by the Royals for $100,000 during the 2015-16 international period, Ruiz put forth a strong showing in the Rookie-level Arizona League in 2017. The Padres took note. They landed Ruiz along with Matt Strahm and Travis Wood for Trevor Cahill, Brandon Maurer and Ryan Buchter before the Trade Deadline. Ruiz ultimately garnered Arizona League MVP honors after pacing the circuit in average (.350), hits (72), doubles (20), triples (10) and total bases (124). He then posted a solid 2018 campaign with Class A Fort Wayne - where he showcased his excellent power/speed combo with 12 homers and 49 steals.  When he stays in the strike zone, Ruiz combines wrist strength, bat speed and physical strength to produce hard line drives and some raw power. But he's had trouble laying off pitches outside the zone. With his glove, Ruiz is less advanced, and he profiles as a fringe-average defender at second base with an OK arm. He's an above average runner who reaches maximum speed quickly, and he can be very aggressive on the basepaths.  One of the better all-around athletes in the organization, the Padres are excited about Ruiz's combination of hitting ability and speed. He has the tools to project as an everyday player at the highest level, but he needs a good amount of time for refinement on both sides of the ball.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","17","\"2015 J2 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","25","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"53.2\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","55","60","30","50","55","55","60","55","40","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","55","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["369","366","546","403","1071","\"46.2\"","\"44.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"45.2\"","\"40.8\"","\"45.6\"","\"|\"","\"Seth\"","\"Beer\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"DH\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2423","666179","\"beer_seth\"","","\"sa3006658\"","\"|\"","","\"Clemson\"","-1","2","","\"Med\"","2021","42","\"QgU3Pu8OJ4A\"","","\"Beer was on the scouting radar very early as a prep underclassman who was old for his year but had tools, performed, and was a decorated swimmer. Instead of reclassifying and enter the 2015 draft as an 18-year-old, Beer skipped his high school senior year completely and early-enrolled in January at Clemson. He wasn't on the radar for the top couple rounds, so scouts weren't sure he'd perform well, but Beer went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts.   The pessimistic view is that Beer is a player with old skills that peaked that season, as his stats regressed a bit from historic to merely among the best. The optimistic view is that Beer has impact plus-plus raw power, a long track record of production and will fit as an everyday 1B/DH type. We're a bit on the pessimistic side, as Beer is a 20 runner whose athleticism has backed up. He may only fit at DH now and we worried his swing was grooved enough that the hit tool may only be a 40, but with plenty of walks and power. The slippery slope to platoon DH is in sight, so we'd like to see some higher minors performance before we adjust our projections.   His pro debut was strong and he'll likely spend this year at Hi- and/or Double-A at age 22, age-appropriate for prospects, which will show us where he is on the spectrum of expected performance from Dan Vogelbach to Nate Lowe, or maybe Rhys Hoskins at the very high end.\"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","\"2018, 1st (28) - HOU\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 20 | Arm: 45 | Field: 30 | Overall: 50  Beer graduated from high school a semester early to enroll early at Clemson, where he was the consensus Freshman of the Year in 2016 and won the Dick Howser Award as national player of the year. He posted numbers as good as anyone's in college baseball during his three years with the Tigers: .321/.489/.648 with 56 homers and nearly twice as many walks (180) as strikeouts (98). Concerns about his ability to hit with wood and lack of athleticism dropped him to the Astros with the 28th pick last June, though he performed well in his pro debut and reached Class A Advanced after signing for $2.25 million.  Beer was the most polarizing player in the 2018 Draft. His proponents loved his strength and plate discipline, while his critics didn't like his less-than-smooth left-handed stroke or his persistent struggles with wood bats on the high school showcase circuit and with the U.S. collegiate national team. Houston made some mechanical tweaks to his swing in hopes of enhancing his plate coverage and power, and they worked well in his introduction to pro ball before he got overly aggressive in Class A Advanced.  While Beer set national records in the 50- and 100-meter backstroke as an 11- and 12-year-old, he's a limited athlete whose value will come almost solely from his bat. The Astros are trying to help him improve his quickness, but he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner with fringy arm strength. He has well-below-average range in left field and could perhaps become an adequate first baseman, though there's a good chance he winds up as a DH.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"AA\"","13","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.0\"","\"46.4\"","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","2.0","1.0","\"|\"","35","40","70","20","30","45","40","55","70","20","40","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","20","45","30","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["370","367","418","780","115","\"46.2\"","\"45.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"52.8\"","\"49.4\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jean Carlos,Jean\"","\"Mejia,Carlos Mejia\"","2019","\"22.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"240\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2789","650496","","","\"sa830122\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","40","","","\"We're mindful of the need to identify pitchers whose fastballs play like impact pitches despite mediocre velocity, and Mejia appears to be one.

Francisco Mejia blossomed into one of the best catching prospects in baseball after signing for $350,000 and was traded to the Padres for Brad Hand and Adam Cimber last July, while Jean Carlos (no relation) spent his first three years as a pro in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League after signing for $45,000. The latter finally made his full-season debut in 2018, impressing enough in low Class A to earn a spot on Cleveland's 40-man roster.  Though the Indians didn't make Mejia a full-time starter until last season, he definitely has the attributes to stay in the rotation. His heavy sinker is a plus pitch that sits at 91-94 mph, touches 96 and helped him log a 1.5 groundout/airout ratio in 2018. His curveball and slider have similar potential, and he also has feel for using his changeup.  Mejia is doing a better job of repeating his delivery now that he has grown into his extra-large frame, showing aptitude for commanding his breaking pitches as well as his fastball.

He had a big freshman year there and then had a national coming-out party as the ace of Team USA that summer. Houck continued at about that level for the next two seasons, slinging in a heavy, 91-96 mph sinker from a low slot with a deceptive, crossfire delivery. He threw strikes and had a plus slider. Scouts who weren't as enthusiastic about Houck's changeup, or arm slot, or the length of his arm action saw a reliever. His stuff would flatten out and his command would back up as he fatigued into the late stages of some starts. The Red Sox had Houck change his delivery and arm action for the first half-dozen or so starts in 2018, focusing on a more traditional four-seam fastball approach. It didn't work, and Boston let Houck go back to what he had been doing later in the year, and his dominant final two months of 2018 reflect his comfort with this approach. We think the likely outcome here is a multi-inning power reliever who dominates righties with strikeouts and groundballs, though some see a starter in the mold of Justin Masterson.

The Red Sox have an ace (Chris Sale) who faced the same concerns coming out of college and weren't worried, selecting Houck with the No. 24 overall pick in 2017 and signing him for $2,614,500. Houck tried to reinvent himself during his first full pro season and got shelled for a 6.16 ERA during the first half of 2018, then went back to what worked as an amateur and logged a 2.86 ERA in the second half.  Houck is at his best when he pitches off his two-seam fastball and his slider. His 92-96 mph two-seamer has heavy sink and bore, and right-handers have trouble picking it up out of his low-three-quarters crossfire delivery. His low-80s slider has plenty of lateral break and also gives righties fits.   At the start of last year, Houck relied more on a four-seamer that can reach 98 mph and a curveball with more depth while working from a higher slot, a combination that cost him command and deception. His biggest need is to improve his changeup so he can handle left-handers more efficiently. The Red Sox are committed to developing him as a starter whose ceiling could land him in the middle of their rotation, though some scouts think he'll become a multi-inning reliever who will beat up on right-handers.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"AA\"","9","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.7\"","\"52.1\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2650","40","50","45","50","","55","","50","50","50","55","","60","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","50","55","","","","50","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["372","369","303","191","886","\"46.2\"","\"46.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"47.0\"","\"41.1\"","\"47.6\"","\"|\"","\"MJ\"","\"Melendez\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","270","6","\"|\"","2109","669004","\"melendez_mj\"","","\"sa3004139\"","\"|\"","","\"Westminster Christian HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","45","\"jMI-XsZIgSA\"","","\"Opinions regarding Melendez's defense have been surprisingly mixed considering he was an adolescent catching prodigy.

Instead, when it once seemed like Melendez might turn into an elite defender, it now appears he'll merely be good.   That mass has added power, though, the kind of power that would certainly profile everyday were Melendez able to get to it in games. He strikes out a lot, enough that teams are concerned about it. He was on early drafts of our Top 100 but was one of the prospects we were told most often to move down when we sourced teams for feedback.

In a class that lacked catching prospects, Melendez stood out, and the Royals took him No. 52 overall and gave him a bonus north of $2 million, well above pick value, to sign him away from playing for his father, Mervyl, the coach at Florida International. If his first full season of pro ball is any indication, it will be money well spent, as Melendez finished third in the system in RBIs and fourth in homers, all while learning the nuances of catching.    The left-handed-hitting backstop has some serious raw power to tap into, with bat speed and loft that will allow him to continue to show over-the-fence pop. There is too much swing and miss to Melendez's game, with a strikeout rate of more than 30 percent heading into 2019, and he'll have to continue to refine his approach at the plate to keep reaching his power as he advances. Melendez is very athletic, running better than most catchers, and uses that agility behind the plate. He is an excellent blocker and already shows an ability to work with pitchers to call a good game. His plus arm allowed him to throw out nearly 42 percent of potential base stealers in 2018.    Developing high school catching is often a crapshoot, but Melendez, thanks to his all-around skills and having grown up around the game, has a chance to buck the trend.

While he hasn't replicated that success during his junior season, he was coming on a bit stronger to climb out of his early-season funk.  Stowers' power is legitimate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields with good bat speed, and he showed enough ability to make contact to hit .326 in the Cape over the summer. There is length in his left-handed swing, however, leading to some swing and miss issues at times, including 34 strikeouts in 34 Cape League games. A solid athlete who runs well enough, Stowers has largely stuck to the outfield corners in college though he was seeing time in center field this spring, with most seeing left field as his likely long-term home.

Miller has a history of throwing strikes, though his command isn't as fine as his control and he doesn't have much margin for error. He may not be more than a back-of-the-rotation starter or a middle reliever, but the progress he made in 2018 was encouraging.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","\"AA\"","25","\"2016 Draft Rnd 4 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","19","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"50.8\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2400","45","50","45","","50","","","50","50","50","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","55","","","","50","","",""],["376","373","533","779","297","\"46.1\"","\"44.4\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"46.7\"","\"51.0\"","\"|\"","\"Griffin\"","\"Roberts\"","2019","\"23.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2189","675965","\"roberts_griffin\"","","\"sa3008483\"","\"|\"","","\"Wake Forest\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\" \"","","\"Roberts was the closer for Wake Forest as a draft-eligible sophomore in 2017 and turned down six figure offers to go back to school as a 22-year-old junior and try his hand at starting. His hellacious plus-plus slider was just as good and his velocity held, working 89-93 and touching 95. Roberts' command is enough to start and his changeup flashes average, but some scouts project him as a Luke Gregerson-like slider-heavy reliever, both because of his arm action and his slider-heavy approach. In today's velocity-obsessed game, Roberts' only ability that is above average is his slider and he leans on it heavily, which would make him ideal for a multi-inning hybrid role and doesn't describe many traditional big league starters. The Cardinals would like to see if he can turn into a volume starter, but he'll likely get to the bigs quickly regardless since he could help soon and in multiple roles.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2018, CBA (43) - STL\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 70 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  After struggling to throw strikes out of the bullpen as a Wake Forest freshman, Roberts started learning how to harness his stuff and became an all-conference closer in 2017, when he recorded eight saves while striking out 13.5 per nine. He moved into the rotation as a junior and blossomed, proving highly effective in the new role as he slashed his walk rate while leading the Atlantic Coast Conference in strikeouts (130). The Cardinals took Roberts with the No. 43 overall pick that June, signed him for full slot value and pushed him up to Class A Advanced Palm Beach's bullpen ahead of the Florida State League playoffs. After the season, Roberts was handed a 50-game suspension in December after a second positive test for a drug of abuse.  Roberts' calling card is his slider, a plus-plus pitch that many scouts regarded as the best college breaking ball in his Draft class. It's a mid-80s breaker with a high spin rate and so much break that some saw it as a power curve. As a starter, Roberts typically throws his fastball in the 90-95 mph range, but he sat in the mid-90s and touched 97 when he was relieving in 2017. He flashes an average changeup with some fade, a pitch he'll need more to succeed at the next level.  Whether Roberts can remain a starter will depend largely on his control and command, which did improve in 2018, and whether his stuff will hold up over the course of a full season in a rotation. The Cards are committed to developing him in that role, where they believe he has untapped potential. However, many evaluators believe Roberts is destined for the bullpen and could jump on the fast track to the big leagues in the role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"A+\"","9","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"52.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.6667","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2225","2900","45","45","40","","60","","","50","50","50","","65","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","70","","","","45","","",""],["377","374","500","513","564","\"46.1\"","\"44.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.0\"","\"44.6\"","\"49.4\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Helsley\"","2019","\"24.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2240","664854","","18138","\"sa874172\"","\"|\"","","\"Northeastern State\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","42","\" \"","","\"Helsley, who is of Cherokee heritage, likely would have reached the majors in 2018 had he not been sidelined with shoulder fatigue in early-June. The injury effectively ended his season, as he was up for one August rehab appearance and then shut down again for the rest of the year. The exact nature of the injury is unknown and it's not clear if Helsley will be ready for the start of spring training. When healthy, Helsley has an effective four-pitch mix led by a fastball that sits in the 93-97 range and will touch 100. Helsley doesn't have precise fastball command and throws a middling ratio of strikes, but he throws hard enough to get away with mistakes in the zone, and his ability to execute his breaking balls -- the slider down and to his glove side, the curveball in the bottom of the zone or beneath it -- gives him a pretty good chance to start. There are clubs that have Helsley evaluated as a reliever either because of the lack of fastball command or due to perceptions about his deilvery and health. If not for uncertainty surrounding his injury, he'd be right behind Hudson on this list as a near-ready mid-rotation arm or dominant 70-80 inning reliever. \"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2015, 5th (161) - STL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Cutter: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  The Cardinals selected Helsley in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft out of Division II Northeastern State, a program that has never produced a big leaguer. Helsley pitched at three levels in his second full season, climbing from high Class A to Triple-A, and was on the verge of reaching the Majors in 2018 until he experienced shoulder fatigue in early June and subsequently landed on the disabled list. The Cardinals sent Helsley on a rehab assignment to the Gulf Coast League in early August, only to shut him down for the remainder of the season after one start. Following the season, St. Louis added the right-hander to its 40-man roster.   While not a physically imposing presence on the mound as a slightly undersized righty, Helsley does have big-time arm strength and pitches with power stuff. He relies largely on his fastball-curve combination, recording high spin rates with both pitches. He can approach triple digits and will sit at 94-97 mph with his fastball, throwing it with riding life that allows him to beat hitters within the zone. His power curveball in the low 80s nets him whiffs, and he generally does a good job of locating it down in the zone. Helsley's upper-80s cutter gives him a third average-or-better pitch, one that helps to keep hitters off his fastball, and he demonstrates feel for mixing in a changeup. He's usually around the zone with his entire arsenal, albeit with command that requires further refinement, especially with regards to his fastball.   Beyond his impressive stuff and strong track record of performance, Helsley is effective against right- and left-handed hitters alike -- they batted .195 and .192 against him, respectively, in 2018 -- and gets high marks for his attention to things like fielding his position and holding runners. Because of his size, arm strength and command, some have thought Helsley was destined to land in a bullpen. He'll continue to start for now and is said to be healthy entering the spring, but it goes without saying that his fastball-curve combination would play up nicely in shorter stints as needed.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"MLB\"","7","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"51.4\"","\"43.6\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.0833","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2525","2525","40","60","40","50","","45","","50","60","45","55","","50","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","50","","50","","","45","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["378","375","487","514","489","\"46.1\"","\"44.8\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.4\"","\"44.2\"","\"49.8\"","\"|\"","\"Huascar\"","\"Ynoa\"","2019","\"21.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","702","660623","","","\"sa873433\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","40","\"7AxhbuWGmis\"","","\"Ynoa's older bother Michel was the July 2nd bonus record-holder for awhile and still sets the pace for non-Cuban pitchers in the market. Huascar was also a premium arm in his class, receiving a high-six-figure bonus and making incremental progress since then, reaching a velocity peak of 100 mph in 2018. Ynoa's fastball plays down a bit because he's a short strider and throws a bit of sinker, but it often flattens out up in the zone when he overthrows, happens at his highest velocities. His slider occasionally flashes plus, but projecting a 55 pitch is more reasonable for the type of breaker he can command. Ynoa's changeup is usable and his command shows flashes, but he was added to the 40-man roster this year and will start burning options now.

His move up to the Appalachian League was a bit more uneven, and he was traded to the Braves in July 2017 in the Jaime Garcia deal. Ynoa fared well across two levels of full-season Class A ball in his organizational debut, earning a spot on the 40-man roster.  Ynoa has shown an ability to make adjustments to his delivery that has him pointing in the right direction. He's more on line and direct and is finishing consistently downhill now, rather than yanking to the glove side as he does when he gets out of sync. That's led to better command of his 93-95 mph fastball, with some feeling he'll eventually get to average overall command and control. His breaking ball gets caught in between the curve and slider, with a true slider perhaps fitting better with his profile. He has good feel for his average changeup.  Big and strong, Ynoa took a nice step in the right direction during his full-season and Braves organization debut.

But the injury history and velo fluctuation are bothersome, and so too is the way White's strike-throwing has plateaued.

In actuality, he was a 2016 second-rounder out of Santa Clara, the Broncos' highest pick since Randy Winn in 1995, and he signed for a well below-slot $590,800. White advanced to Double-A and continued to dazzle with his fastball and breaking pitches in 2017, though he wasn't as sharp last year after missing the first month with a sore arm.  At his best, White features a 92-97 mph fastball with natural run and sink, an overpowering slider that climbs into the upper 80s with late bite and a hammer curveball. He spent the early part of 2018 working in the low 90s and with more ordinary sliders and curves, though his stuff picked back up later in the season. He also can morph his slider into a harder and equally nasty cutter and is working to refine a changeup to counteract left-handers.  White sometimes battles his delivery and command but did a better job of repeating his mechanics and finding the strike zone during the second half of 2018. He has the upside of a mid-rotation starter who can generate more than his share of swings and misses as well as ground-ball contact.

Perhaps it was concerns about strikeouts, or the vague and mysterious injury bug that bit Walker during the Big 12 tournament, that caused him to fall out of the first round despite hitting .352/.441/.606 in a large conference. He's an athletic swinger with a natural uppercut swing that seemed likely to help him lift the ball regularly, and the little bit of batted ball data we have from after Walker signed suggests that notion is correct. We're doubtful that he stays in center field long term, but it's hard to say that definitively because Walker lost reps there to Murray in college, and may yet develop better feel. He's likely a big league regular if he can either stay in center or avoid perilously high strikeout rates, a star if he does both, and a corner platoon bat if he does neither.\"","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","\"2018, 2nd (46) - CWS\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  The White Sox got the best college hitter in the 2018 Draft when they took Nick Madrigal with the fourth overall choice, and they may have gotten the second-best when Walker was unexpectedly available in the second round. He improved throughout his college career at Oklahoma, where he played alongside Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray in the outfield. Though he looked tired and struggled with his rhythm at the plate after signing for an over-slot $2 million, he has a track record of performing well with wood bats, leading the Northwoods League in hitting (.406) in 2016 and topping the the U.S. collegiate national team's regulars in OPS (.931) the next summer.  Walker has better hand-eye coordination and pitch recognition than most hitters, and he uses a controlled approach to drill line drives to all fields. While he's not big, his quick left-handed bat, deceptive strength and hitting prowess should give him at least average power. He also should post high on-base percentages as he continues to refine his plate discipline.  Walker's bat is his lone above-average tool, but his instincts help him play above his physical ability and his all-around game earns him some Mark Kotsay comparisons.

He has mediocre natural timing and feel to hit, and his front side often leaks, which impacts his ability to spoil breaking stuff away from him. His lower half got thicker and stronger during the offseason, making it more likely that he ends up in right field rather than center. But this is a potential middle-of-the-order hitter because of the raw power; the swing has natural loft, and the early-career plate discipline data is strong.

He came to the United States in 2018 and continued to show solid all-around potential while becoming a full-time center fielder.   Canario has electric bat speed that's the best in the Giants system. He's still maturing at the plate, as his right-handed swing can get overly long when he swings for the fences rather than letting his power come naturally. He generates high exit velocities and displays the patience to draw walks, though he won't take off until he focuses on making more consistent contact.   After playing mostly right field in his debut, Canario made a nice transition to center last summer. Club officials think he'll be able to stay there if he continues to hone his reads and routes.

He signed for $1.3 million and then made his professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League. In '18, he caught 70 games in the Midwest League with strong numbers on offense and an impressive showing behind the plate. But Campusano's season came to an early end in August because of a concussion.   Campusano has a pair of plus tools in his raw power and arm strength, but his approach is too aggressive and his right-handed swing too long at times. Still, Campusano's bat speed and penchant for making loud contact both bode well if he can make the necessary adjustments. His power is almost exclusively to the pull side, but he'd begun to make adjustments and use the entire field before his 2018 season ended early due to injury.  Campusano should remain behind the plate, as he shows solid blocking technique and receiving skills that have gotten better. His best weapon is an accurate and strong arm, and he consistently delivers sub-2.0 second pop times. Campusano will need time to develop his game, but the final product could be an everyday catcher who contributes on both sides of the ball.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"A+\"","16","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"36.4\"","\"49.1\"","\"43.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","20","55","50","40","60","45","50","60","40","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","30","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["385","382","396","776","98","\"46.0\"","\"45.3\"","\"41.4\"","\"53.1\"","\"50.2\"","\"53.4\"","\"|\"","\"T.J.\"","\"Zeuch\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"79\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1660","643615","\"zeuch_tj\"","","\"sa738498\"","\"|\"","","\"Pittsburgh\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"zBgqGOK79w4\"","","\"Zeuch doesn't have dominant stuff but he's a keen sequencer with a firm grasp on how best to deploy his pitches to efficiently tally outs. He mostly pitches to contact with a low-90s sinker that has very steep downhill plane thanks to Zeuch's height and fairly upright delivery. It's helped him generate ground ball rates near 60% as a pro. Both of his breaking balls survive because Zeuch locates them. He'll get ahead of hitters with his curveball and keep his slider just off the plate away from righties. Offspeed development remains key as Zeuch enters 2019 as a non-roster invitee. He may be a candidate for a true splitter, or modified version of it, rather than a straight changeup if the Jays want to try to turn him into Doug Fister, with whom Zeuch shares several other traits. Barring something unforeseen, like a new grip giving Zeuch a dominant secondary pitch, he projects as a backend innings eater.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2016, 1st (21) - TOR\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  A strong showing as a Pittsburgh junior in 2016 pushed Zeuch into the first round of the Draft, where the Blue Jays selected the big right-hander with the No. 21 overall pick. A back injury limited Zeuch somewhat during his first full season, but he still jumped on the big league radar by pitching well at Class A Advanced Dunedin and then boosted his stock even more against better competition in the Arizona Fall League. Returning to the Florida State League in 2018, Zeuch made just six starts at Dunedin before moving up to Double-A New Hampshire. He was an Eastern League All-Star at midseason, and continued to pitch well down the stretch while leading the Fisher Cats to an Eastern League title.   An imposing presence on the mound at 6-foot-7, Zeuch uses his height to his advantage by creating a steep angle to the plate. The downhill plane only enhances the right-hander's sinker, a plus pitch he throws with heavy late life in the low- to mid-90s. This enables him to generate ground balls at a near-elite rate (57 percent in '18). Zeuch's curveball has become his best secondary offering and plays nicely off his sinker, keeping hitters off-balance with its shape and late bite. His slider wasn't as sharp in 2018 but is still viewed as an average pitch, and he also throws a changeup that's a distant fourth pitch. Despite his size, Zeuch's long levers are consistently in-sync, and he repeats his delivery well. It allows him to pound the zone with his entire arsenal.   Zeuch assuaged concerns about his durability last season by accruing more than 156 innings, or more than double the workload from his first full season. The only drawback to Zeuch's profile is that he doesn't miss many bats and therefore doesn't rack up strikeouts. Instead, he mostly pitches to contact, consistently attacking the bottom of the zone early in the count to force weak contact. Altogether, Zeuch has the look of a future backend starter at the highest level, perhaps more if he can improve his breaking balls and start to generate more whiffs.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"A+\"","12","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"51.4\"","\"55.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2250","55","60","45","50","40","","","60","60","50","55","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","55","50","","","","50","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["386","383","381","344","866","\"46.0\"","\"45.4\"","\"45.0\"","\"47.1\"","\"41.9\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","\"Luis\"","\"Escobar\"","2019","\"23.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","1625","650813","","","\"sa828442\"","\"|\"","","\"Colombia\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","45","\" \"","","\"Escobar exists at the right time in baseball history because his deficiencies are more acceptable now than they ever have been before.

A big '17 that saw him go to the Futures Game, lead the organization in strikeouts and get added to the 40-man roster put him more firmly on the map. He reached Double-A in 2018, but wasn't nearly as dominant in the process.  Stuff-wise, Escobar has more than enough to get big league hitters out. He has a lively fastball that he throws consistently up to the mid-90s that can miss bats and get weak contact on the ground. He'll show a plus curveball that can be a true out pitch and a changeup that might be above-average when all is said and done. The premium stuff can play down at times because of his below average command and control. He walked just over four per nine innings in 2018, in line with his career rate, though he really struggled to find the strike zone when he moved up to Double-A.

He was probably slightly underscouted as an amateur, and definitely underdeveloped. For a month and a half of 2018, he showed mid-rotation stuff, then blew out his elbow and needed Tommy John. He may not be back in affiliated ball until late next summer, but he was quite young for a college draftee (another trait he shares with Howard) and has more developmental wiggle room for a setback like this than most of his peers would.

Targeting his upside in the latter role, the Rays selected him in the fourth round in June and signed him for $367,500. The right-hander's pro debut only validated Tampa Bay's scouting efforts, as Strotman posted a 1.79 ERA and a 0.75 WHIP while holding hitters to a .168 average over 51 innings in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. Advancing to Class A Bowling Green in 2018, Strotman got off to a strong start in the Midwest League before undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery in June.  When he's healthy, Strotman combines size and athleticism with a lightning-quick arm to generate a plus fastball that bumps 97-98 mph and sits at 93-95. His slider can be inconsistent but has the makings of at least an above-average pitch, while further strides in developing his changeup could give Strotman a third Major League-average offering at maturity. Meanwhile, Strotman's three-pitch mix plays up thanks to his advanced control and command and because he's adept at pitching down in the zone.  Many expect Strotman, with his electric arm and promising arsenal, to serve as a valuable bullpen piece once he's fully developed. The Rays, however, will continue to deploy him as a starter, with the goal of offering him as many innings as possible so as to further his development.

His injury issues date back to his college days at Cal when he had shoulder trouble that the coaching staff initially said was hamstring tightness. An excellent on-mound athlete with advanced command, Jefferies was 91-93 the summer after he signed, then 92-95 with a reshaped array of secondary offerings the following spring. He looked likely to be a quick-mover, someone who might reach Double-A in his first full season. Alas, his UCL did not cooperate and Jefferies had Tommy John a week after James Kaprielian did. Jefferies returned during 2018 extended spring training and his velocity had totally returned. He was 92-93 early in rehab outings, then 91-95 in his first official AZL game back from surgery, but it would be his last in-game outing of the summer as he was shelved for the remainder of the regular season by a setback.   Healthy Jefferies has surgical command of a low-90s heater and plus power changeup. So firm is Jefferies' cambio that TrackMan units often mistakenly classify it as a sinker as it resides in the mid-to-upper 80s. It bottoms out late and hard, and is Jefferies' best secondary pitch. His breaking stuff has evolved since college and at last look, he was throwing a fringy curveball that is effective because of his ability to locate it, and an average upper-80s cutter. He's a potential fourth starter with a value-altering injury history.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2016, CBA (37) - OAK\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  Jefferies answered questions about a shoulder injury during his junior season at California when he came back and pitched well leading up to the Draft. The A's were convinced and took him with the No. 37 pick in 2016. His career in the organization has barely gotten started as he needed Tommy John surgery after just two outings and has logged just two Rookie-level innings since.  Jefferies did participate in mini camp as the 2019 season approached and the ball was coming out of his hand well. His velocity was up to 90-91 mph in bullpen sessions and he'd shown excellent command of his low-90s fastball in the past. His changeup has the chance to be a plus pitch, thrown with terrific deception, and the bottom falls out of the pitch. His slider looks more like a cutter to some and it has more teeth that way, with the A's wishing he would have a little more finish on the end of it to turn it into a better-than-average pitch.  Jefferies was always known as a strike-thrower before the injury, so the hope is his command will eventually come back once he shakes the rust off. He's made good post-surgery progress and should be ready to start attacking the organizational ladder in earnest.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"AA\"","13","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.7\"","\"57.1\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2450","50","55","55","45","","50","","60","55","60","50","","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","","50","","","","55","\"HOU\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["389","386","307","401","360","\"46.0\"","\"46.2\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.2\"","\"47.9\"","\"50.4\"","\"|\"","\"Alex\"","\"Faedo\"","2019","\"23.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2081","656412","\"faedo_alex\"","","\"sa829855\"","\"|\"","","\"Florida\"","-1","0","","\"Med\"","2020","42","","","\"While his fastball has bounced back into the low-90s after sitting in the upper-80s at times last year, we still have concerns about how it's going to play against big league hitters because Faedo is such a short strider.

There's a chance it plays like a 40 fastball, even though its velo has rebounded some. Faedo's funky low slot may flummox hitters enough to counterbalance his lack of extension somewhat, and it no doubt helps him create bat-missing action on his slider, which is excellent. He had several years of success against SEC hitting, and is a crafty sequencer. There are things to like, and some teams think Faedo is a high probability No. 4 or 5 starter, but we consider the velo fluctuation, lack of extension, and Faedo's multiple knee surgeries, to be long term concerns.\"","\"|\"","","\"DET\"","\"2017, 1st (18) - DET\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  A pair of knee surgeries after Faedo's sophomore year at Florida led to a sluggish start for the junior in 2017. But he finished strongly, turning in a dominant performance as the College World Series' Most Outstanding Player shortly after the Tigers took him at No. 18 overall in the June Draft. He didn't pitch after signing for $3.5 million, as Detroit erred on the side of caution after Faedo's long college season. Assigned to high Class A Lakeland for his debut, Faedo pitched well in the Florida State League but struggled in Double-A, allowing 15 home runs in 60 innings after receiving a mid-June promotion.   By the end of his final season with Florida, Faedo was back to full strength, featuring his plus fastball and one of the best sliders in the class. In his first pro season, though, he underwhelmed with his raw stuff, showing a slower arm that affected the life on all of his pitches and made him susceptible to the long ball in Double-A. After working at 92-95 mph as a junior, Faedo hovered around 90-91 mph with a flatter fastball in 2018. His slider regressed as well, showing less depth and bite and netting him fewer whiffs, and he struggled to execute his changeup without a lively fastball to work off of. He did throw a lot of strikes, though it's more control than command right now.  It's not uncommon for college pitchers to experience diminished velocity in their first full professional season, only to bounce back the next year once they have a better understanding of the physical demands of a full season.

Sometimes the answer to that question depends significantly on which team would be making the decision, and perhaps was no recent trade a better example of this than Cleveland's acquisition of Mercado. In anticipation of a short-term need for outfielders, Cleveland traded teenage beast Jhon Torres for Mercado, a low-ceiling lock to contribute to the big league team at some point soon.   Once a prep infield prospect, Mercado moved to the outfield after a few uninspiring statistical years with St. Louis, started to hit, became a plus outfield defender, and was part of a log jammed upper-level Cardinals outfield picture. The swap made sense for both teams. Cleveland got a potential everyday center fielder (Mercado won't hit for much power but might be a 6 glove and 55 bat, which is playable everyday in center) and St. Louis diffused some 40-man pressure in exchange for a great, long-term prospect. Cleveland's outfield situation may change depending on performance, and Mercado may be thrust into an everyday role at some point in 2019.

He continued to struggle at the plate in his first four pro seasons before moving to center field in 2017 and improving offensively once he had lesser defensive responsibilities. In need of righty-hitting outfielders, the Indians acquired him in exchange for outfielders Conner Capel and Jhon Torres last July.  While Mercado has gotten better at the plate, he still may not provide enough offense to be an everyday player in the big leagues. He's showing more bat speed than he did when he played shortstop and makes consistent contact, but he may have a ceiling as an average hitter with just decent power and on-base ability. A plus runner, he has basestealing aptitude and swiped a total of 158 bags in his first four full seasons.  Mercado's speed also plays well on defense.

The AFL is not a great place to evaluate catching, because guys are tired and forced to quickly learn an entirely new staff of pitchers, but independent of that qualifier, lots of teams simply don't think Allen can play back there due a lack of arm strength and/or receiving ability. Others think Allen is serviceable, and would gladly give up what he lacks on defense for what he'd provide at the catching position on offense: huge power, rare for the position.   Allen elevates the ball with authority and has been doing so since college. He slugged .728 as a junior (while facing questions about competition quality in addition to the defensive stuff) and he has 50 or more extra base hits in each of the last two seasons. It's All-Star offensive ability for a catcher, it's just that most of the industry doesn't like him at the position. Perhaps what San Diego has done with Francisco Mejia (let him catch pitchers he can handle) will serve as precedent for what they may try with Allen, whose issues are admittedly different than Mejia's. They could let Allen catch pitchers who are adept at holding runners on their own, give him a start at first now and then, and let him take high-leverage at-bats off the bench against righties the rest of the time.

As he worked his way to Double-A San Antonio in 2018, Allen never stopped hitting. Despite regular catching duties, he's yet to post a full-season average below .280 or a full-season on-base percentage below .350.  A left-handed hitter with bat speed and strength, Allen is an offensive-minded backstop who knows how to drive the ball. He has a knack for making hard contact to all fields and generally does a good job controlling the strike zone. There's plenty of power in his profile, as Allen has homered 22 times in each of the past two seasons, and he should hit for average, too. But his strikeout rate has ticked up a bit since his impressive 2016 full-season debut.  Allen's large frame continues to raise questions among evaluators about whether he can stay behind the plate long term. He played 19 games at first base in 2018. He has some raw arm strength, but he needs to improve his catch-and-throw skills. In his four pro seasons, baserunners have swiped approximately four of every five bags against Allen. His receiving skills need work, too, though club officials are pleased with the recent progress he's made. Ultimately, Allen's defense will never be his strength.

He led the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League in strikeout rate (12.3 per nine innings) and ranked second in K/BB ratio (9.9).  While he lacks size, Henriquez routinely pumps out 92-96 mph fastballs with sink and he touched 98 mph at age 18. His high-spin curveball combines power with depth and could give him a second plus pitch once it's more consistent. He has little experience using a changeup and his is still too firm.   Henriquez generates his electric fastball and curveball with a quick arm rather than effort. He easily repeats his compact delivery, allowing him to pound the strike zone.

He starred as a dual threat high school quarterback in Mississippi, and continued playing football in college even after the Jays, who at the time were able to offer Alford a now defunct two-sport deal structured to incentivize him to eventually commit to baseball, drafted and signed him. His college football career and home life were both tumultuous, as Southern Miss went winless during Alford's first year under center, and several members of his family had legal troubles. Alford eventually transferred to Ole Miss, where he was asked to play safety. But that didn't last long and he soon committed full time to baseball.   He's dealt with constant injury as a pro and has issues with quality of contact when healthy. Though he's a remarkable athlete with huge raw power and speed, we're bearish on Alford's ability to hit breaking stuff and do enough damage to play everyday. He projects as a bench outfielder. Because Alford has only been totally devoted to baseball since 2015, there's a chance some of what currently impairs his on-field production can be remedied, but he has to stay on the field to develop that stuff.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","\"2012, 3rd (112) - TOR\"","","2019","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The Blue Jays let Alford, their third-round pick in 2012, follow through on his desire to play college football at Southern Mississippi after signing him for $750,000. He spent most of 2012-14 on the gridiron, eventually transferring to Mississippi as a defensive back before deciding to focus on baseball full-time. Alford's time away from the game didn't show in his first full season, but a knee injury as well as a concussion in 2016 disrupted his progress. He made his big league debut in May the following year, getting the call straight from Double-A, only to suffer a broken hamate bone that shelved him for two months. Alford would return to the Majors in 2018, though he hit just .105 with the Blue Jays and struggled at Double- and Triple-A after a hamstring strain delayed his start to the season.   Alford is a tremendous athlete and has a collection of impressive tools, but it hasn't transferred into production for him in the upper Minors and big leagues as expected. He has a quick bat and can show plus raw power from the right side of plate, though his approach as well as the quality of his contact both backed up in 2018. The regression had a major impact on Alford's on-base skills, as he finished with a .314 OBP that was well south of his career average (.360). Club officials are confident that he will get back on track, though, noting that Alford appeared to be pressing for much of the season after his late start. Alford's lower-half injuries have robbed him of some speed, but he's still a plus runner who can cover large swaths in the outfield, offering above-average defense across all three positions.   The potential is there for Alford to become an everyday player in the big leagues, though he'll first need to re-establish a consistent approach and show that he can drive the ball to all fields as he did early in his career. If he can't cut it as a regular, Alford still should offer value as a fourth outfielder with his speed, versatility and on-base skills.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AAA\"","25","\"2012 Draft Rnd 3 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"48.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","40","60","70","50","40","40","45","60","70","55","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","60","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["394","391","314","400","359","\"45.9\"","\"46.1\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.2\"","\"45.6\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Kris\"","\"Bubic\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2426","663460","\"bubic_kris\"","","\"sa3008128\"","\"|\"","","\"Stanford\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","42","\"1rpGvmAv8vM\"","","\"A dominant junior year would have had Bubic in the late first round mix, but his control backed up, especially late in the year.

Bubic's best pitch is his changeup and it's most effective when he's gotten ahead of hitters, which he often did not last year. When he's throwing strikes, Bubic looks like a solid No. 4/5 big league starter.

Kansas City took five college arms with its first five picks in the top two rounds. After nabbing Florida right-handers Brady Singer and Jackson Kowar, then Virginia lefty Daniel Lynch with their first three picks, the Royals went out west and got another lefty in Bubic, Stanford's Saturday starter, with pick No. 40 overall, sending him to the Rookie-level Pioneer League for his pro debut last summer.  Bubic has relied heavily on his fastball and changeup combination with good results. There isn't a ton of velocity differential between the two pitches -- his fastball will sit 91-93 mph and he'll be up to 84-85 mph with his changeup at times -- but his deceptive arm speed and fading action on it makes it an out pitch. Bubic's funky delivery makes it tough for any hitter to pick up either pitch. His curveball isn't as consistent, but there's some projection there, as he used to shelve the pitch if he didn't have the feel for it, something that won't work at the next level. When his delivery is in sync, it can be an above-average pitch; when his timing is off, it can come in soft and up in the zone.  Even with the unorthodox delivery, Bubic has always been a strike-thrower and looks like a future No. 4 type starter. He might be a half-step behind the other college arms taken in front of him, but he could easily catch up as he starts his pro career in earnest.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","\"A+\"","10","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"51.7\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2650","40","50","55","45","","","","50","50","60","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","60","50","","","","","50","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["395","392","315","342","473","\"45.9\"","\"46.1\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"41.6\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jose\"","\"Miranda\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","260","6","\"|\"","2602","669304","","","\"sa917952\"","\"|\"","","\"Leadership Christian HS (PR)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","45","","\" \"","\"Miranda is a strong-bodied, multi-positional infielder with advanced feel for contact.

His strikeout rate has hovered around 10% throughout his career despite Miranda having been about a year and a half younger than the average player at each minor league stop.   He may start trading some contact for power (his early-season strikeout and fly ball rates would seem to indicate this might be happening) but that may require more selectivity to work. Miranda's swing is currently bottom-hand heavy and he doesn't rip the bat through contact the way most power hitters do. He's been fine putting quality, low-lying contact into play to his pull side so far, but may be best served to hit for more power, especially if he eventually moves off short.

Miranda has one of the best pure swings in the organization with the chance to be a plus hitter down the line thanks to outstanding bat-to-ball skills and plate discipline from the right side of the plate. He rarely strikes out and can spray the ball to all fields. He's shown more power than expected, with most of his over-the-fence damage coming to his pull side. He's played mostly second and third, and should continue to see an even split between the two spots going forward, though the Twins got him a little time at shortstop in 2018, where his range is limited, but his hands and arm work fine.

Cavaco first started getting attention for his complete tools package at the Angel Elite showcase in the fall, where his tremendous raw power particularly stood out. The only question about his offensive profile is how consistently he'll hit to get to that power, as there is some swing and miss to his game. Beyond the bat, Cavaco will show flashes of plus tools across the board. He's clocked sub four-second times home to first out of the box and he has the chance to be a plus defender at third, with very good hands, footwork, a plus arm and a willingness to stick his nose in the dirt.

The best of those pitches is his curveball, which flashes big depth and snap, and which he sometimes decelerates his arm to baby into the strike zone, something big league hitters will pick up on. Further changeup develop will be important for Madero as his low arm slot enables lefty hitters to see the ball out of his hand quite early.

But he has three big league offerings and filled up the strike zone in 2018, so he could move quickly if he stays healthy. Pea's delivery is pretty rough and features quite a bit of violence about his head. This, along with his lengthy injury history, has created worries about his health, and hinders his ability to locate with precision, as he throws strikes but not always where he wants to. Perception about Pea's health may drive Washington to move him quickly so he can reach the majors before he breaks again. His stuff appeared close to ready last year, as he worked in the mid-90s with armside movement that pairs well with his power, and a mid-80s changeup, while his lower arm slot enables his slider to play against righties.

Improvements to Pena's velocity and control enabled him to start putting it all together and reach Class A Hagerstown in 2018 before an oblique injury prematurely ended his season in August.   When he's healthy, Pena has impressive stuff. His three-pitch mix is headlined by a mid-90s fastball with late movement that he locates well enough that it helps set up his changeup, an above-average offering that he throws with mid-90s velocity. Pena's slider is a quality third pitch, and he throws everything with a bit of deception thanks to a slightly lower arm slot.   While Pena's delivery isn't the cleanest and he at times will look limited athletically due to his size, he generally repeats his delivery well and throws strikes with all three pitches. Whether he can remain a starter is tied to his ability to stay on the field, though Pena still has a bright future as a big league reliever, perhaps soon, if that doesn't work out.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"A+\"","14","\"2013 J2 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"52.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2250","45","55","50","","50","","","50","55","55","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","","50","","","","50","","",""],["401","398","486","774","210","\"45.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"51.6\"","\"48.8\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Garrett\"","\"Whitlock\"","2019","\"23.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2357","676477","","","\"sa3005306\"","\"|\"","","\"UAB\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","\"ZmiA8bxF8v0\"","","\"When you watch Whitlock (video link above) the first things you should notice are his large stature and slightly awkward arm action and release. He has better feel than you'd guess for repeating his delivery, throwing his sinker down in the zone, and manipulating his slider, so you can see why he had good numbers across three levels in 2018 as a starter. There aren't a ton of starters who look like this or pitch like this in the big leagues. Pitchers whose best skill is locating a good slider (like Cardinals recent first rounder Griffin Roberts, who drew Luke Gregerson comps from scouts) are often put in relief, though secondary-pitch heavy usage is now more common with guys in a rotation.

Whitlock signed for $247,500 out of Alabama-Birmingham in 2017, sliding because of back issues and questionable signability. He fashioned a 31-inning scoreless streak early in his first full pro season and logged a 1.86 ERA between three levels, including a brief stint in Double-A.  Whitlock's low-three-quarters delivery produces 91-94 mph two-seam fastballs with tremendous sink, leading to a stellar 1.7 groundout/airout ratio in 2018. He'll occasionally reach back and hit 96 mph with a four-seamer, but his No. 2 pitch is low-80 slider with two-plane depth. He uses a decent changeup to keep left-handers in check.  Hitters have a tough time picking up Whitlock's pitches because he uses his 6-foot-5 frame to create impressive extension and unusual angle. He has thrown more strikes as a pro than he did in college, enhancing his profile as a starter.

He struggled with the move up to Class A Advanced Carolina in 2017, but he returned there last season and earned honors as a mid-season All-Star before advancing to Double-A in late May. Supak pitched well in the Southern League, showing an impressive four-pitch mix en route to a 2.91 ERA over 16 starts, and the Brewers added him to their 40-man roster after the season.  Supak's velocity has improved as he's grown into his big frame and learned to better repeat his delivery, and he spent his breakout 2018 campaign sitting in the low 90s and touching 95 mph. The 6-foot-5 right-hander will use his height to create angle to the plate, showing feel for pounding the bottom of the zone or elevating his heater with some riding life. His slider and changeup have above-average potential, and he throws both more than he does his mid-70s curveball, a fringy pitch that he can locate for strikes. He's consistently around the zone with all four pitches, demonstrating an above-average control profile, though his command still requires refinement.  The fly-ball tendencies that hurt Supak at times in 2017 improved last season, as he generated more ground-ball contact and did a better job of keeping the ball in the park. His feel for mixing his pitches translates to solid, if unspectacular strikeout rates right now, and he might not miss as many bats at higher levels given his velocity and lack of a put-away pitch. That said, Supak has all the ingredients to be a successful big league starter, with size, stuff and feel for pitching that point to him becoming a durable, back-of-the-rotation asset for the Brewers.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AA\"","17","\"2014 Draft Rnd 2 (PIT)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"49.3\"","\"53.6\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","-1.0","2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2425","2375","50","50","50","50","","45","","55","50","55","55","","50","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","50","55","","","","55","","",""],["403","400","350","398","563","\"45.8\"","\"45.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"49.0\"","\"45.6\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","\"Logan\"","\"Webb\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2672","657277","","","\"sa828873\"","\"|\"","","\"Rocklin HS (CA)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","","","\"Webb spent most of 2016 on the shelf due to Tommy John, and the little bit of 2017 for which he was healthy he spent in a well-manicured relief role.

He was holding a tailing 92-95 deep into starts, topping out at 97, and spinning in a dastardly, bat-missing breaking ball. Unrefined fastball control led to a lot of bullpen projection, but Webb hadn't pitched very much because of injury, so it seemed possible that it might yet improve.   Early in 2019, Webb's stuff was down a bit, more 91-94 and touching 95, before he got popped for PEDs and was suspended for 80 games. He's missed about two years of development due to the TJ and this suspension and developmentally is more like a junior college arm than an advanced Double-A prospect. He has Top 100 stuff (assuming the 2018 heater comes back after this suspension) and if he can somehow refine fastball command and the changeup (or a third pitch of some kind), he could be a No. 4 starter.

After easing back in 2017, he reached Double-A last year while exhibiting the highest ceiling among Giants pitching prospects, but he drew an 80-game suspension this May after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.  Webb announced he was fully back when his fastball hit 98 mph at the outset of Spring Training a year ago, a prelude to sitting at 93-96 with heavy life throughout the 2018 season. He has a second plus pitch in his power breaking ball, which has slider velocity at 82-85 mph with curveball depth. His changeup isn't as advanced, however, as it gets too firm at times and must improve so he can better handle left-handers.  Webb did a nice job of translating his athleticism into strikes before he got hurt, but his control hasn't been as sharp since he returned. The Giants think his willingness to attack hitters and work ethic will help him figure it out, and he did make progress after getting to Double-A.

He hasn't been as consistent at the plate or with his effort this spring, however, so he's more likely to go in the second round.  Wallner's size, strength and aggressive left-handed stroke combine to give him some of the best raw pop in the 2019 college class. He needs to prove he can handle quality velocity and may have to tone down his approach a bit, as he'll chase pitches out of the zone rather than let his prodigious power come naturally. He still draws a healthy amount of walks because pitchers are loathe to challenge him.  Primarily a center fielder in his first two years at Southern Miss, Wallner has below-average speed and moved to right field this spring. He definitely has the arm strength for right, reaching 97 mph with his fastball and complementing it with a hard slider and splitter as a reliever.

He often settles for sub-optimal contact, typically resulting in groundballs, and even though he takes some occasional max-effort hacks that tease the raw power, he's not likely to hit for much of it in games. His speed enables viability in center, but he's just okay out there, and it's not enough to override the offensive issues and enable an everyday role.

He's moved methodically, not touching full-season ball until his fourth summer in 2016. Since then, he's earned in-season promotions in '17 and '18 and really jumped more firmly on the prospect map by hitting his way to Double-A in '18 and earning a spot on the 40-man roster.  Perhaps the most improved player in the organization, Barrera came into his own in 2018 in terms of his approach and consistency in his at-bats. With a line-drive, slashing style, Barrera is showing he has the ability to hit for average with excellent bat control, a decrease in his strikeout rate and an increased willingness to draw walks. He won't be a home run hitter because of his flat bat path, but there could be a bit more pop to unlock at some point. Aggressive with good instincts, Barrera uses his speed well to steal bases. He also uses it to play all three outfield positions and his defensive play has improved nearly as much as his bat has.  Barrera does have the tools to play center field regularly.

Wolf has gotten noticeably stronger, adding at least 10 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame, and dropped his arm slot from high three-quarters to three-quarters. Those changes have increased the velocity and movement on his fastball, which previously sat around 90 mph but has ranged from 90-97 with armside run all spring. His curveball can overmatch hitters as well, residing in the low 80s with 12-6 break when he stays on top of it.    Though Wolf's changeup isn't as effective as his other two pitches, he'll flash some solid ones with fade and tumble.

In more than one case they gambled on pitchers returning from injuries. Thompson was one of those gambles, and it appears to be paying off. The tall right-hander was selected in the third round out of Round Rock High School in Texas, after he underwent Tommy John surgery during his junior season. He joined the Padres organization when they offered a $1.75 million signing bonus - which was $1 million above the slot's value.   Thompson's first two professional seasons came at Class A Fort Wayne, with his workload strictly monitored in his return from surgery. He posted a 4.67 ERA as a 19-year-old and a 4.94 mark at 20, while racking up more than a strikeout per inning. The 6-foot-7 right-hander bulked up a bit prior to the 2019 season, which he opened at Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore.   Thompson's delivery is smooth, and his mid-90s fastball has life. He's athletic for his height, and he should continue to grow into his offspeed pitches. Thompson's slider is his primary putaway offering, and it's easy to forecast the pitch as big league-caliber.

Those traits make him very interesting and perhaps someone we aren't properly enthused about. He's small and has very little raw power, but Lopez's feel for contact is so good that he ends up with sneaky, in-game doubles pop. His three-year ZiPS projections have him at nearly two annual WAR, which means he arguably belongs on our Top 100 list.

Lopez is more the type who has a higher floor than ceiling, one whose tools don't wow you, but there's certainty he's going to be a solid big leaguer. He's been outperforming those tools since the Royals took him out of Creighton, reaching Triple-A in just his second full year of pro ball in 2018.  When you combine Lopez's innate ability to make contact with his advanced approach at the plate and his off the charts intangibles, there's confidence in the organization he's going to be a solid every day big leaguer soon. Lopez knows who he is as a player -- a hitter who draws a ton of walks, doesn't strike out, and runs well. He has the arm, hands and instincts to play shortstop at the highest level, but can seamlessly slide over to second and even saw time at third and the outfield in college.  There's long been worries about his size and lack of strength in terms of him hitting for power and remaining durable for a full season, but Lopez's understanding of what he can and can't do should help mitigate that.

At a skinny 6-foot-1, there are scouts who doubt he can start based solely on his frame, though Hernandez held mid-90s velocity deep into games as a junior at Corpus Christi. If amateur scouts are to be believed, any of the following aspects of Hernandez's current profile could change: his stride direction, his arm slot, his breaking ball usage (he has two that bleed together), and the movement profile of his fastball.   Hernandez was academically ineligible as a sophomore and only started 19 games in three years of college, so there's at least a reason he's behind his peers from a developmental standpoint. He has unteachable arm speed and feel for spin and even if he just ends up as a big league reliever, something that seems pretty reasonable given his talent, it would be a strong outcome for a third round pick. Like Aquino, Hernandez may move up this list quickly with refinement, but we'd like to see it fairly soon given his age.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2018, 3rd (93) - LAA\"","","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Prior to the 2018 Draft, the earliest a player from Texas A&M-Corpus Christi had been drafted was the ninth round. Hernandez's path to easily beating that hasn't necessarily been straight. He was academically ineligible as a sophomore, but then came out and showed very good stuff early in the spring. While he wasn't as dominant all year, it was still enough for the Angels to take him in the third round     Hernandez was up to 98 mph at times during his junior season, sitting more in the 92-95 mph range, throwing the pitch with good sink and showing he could maintain his velocity through starts. He has good feel for his secondary stuff and can throw a distinct curve and slider, though they sometimes blur together into a power slurve. He can really spin it and his breaking stuff does flash plus and he has solid tumbling changeup.    Though he has swing-and-miss stuff, Hernandez didn't dominate in college as much as one would think, as he has trouble commanding his pitches both within and outside the strike zone.

However, Bautista has balance and swing path issues at the plate that limit the quality of his contact in certain parts of the zone.

He spent two summers in the Dominican Summer League after signing and then made his United States debut in the rookie-level Arizona League in 2017. He might have started to figure some things out with a move to the Pioneer League in 2018, when he finished ninth in the rookie-level circuit in slugging percentage and OPS.  A premium athlete, Bautista has long shown a feel to hit, posting batting averages over .300 for three summers running. He makes consistent contact, doesn't strike out much and even will draw some walks. The biggest difference in 2018 is that he started adding strength which helped him impact the ball more and tap into his raw power with some legitimate extra-base ability. A plus runner, Bautista's speed should allow him to steal bases and play center field for a long time.  Reds player development people say Bautista reminds them a bit of Jose Siri at the same age, but with a bit more consistency to his game.

Sanchez's hands began loading even lower than they had before, way down near the bottom of his abdomen, presumably to introduce more lift to his swing. Indeed, Sanchez's ground ball percent dropped nine percentage points, but the changes compromised the quality of his contact in other ways, and made it hard for him to connect with pitches in some parts of the zone at all. His hands were stiff and loading late; they didn't seem as quick and twitchy as they had the previous year. These issues were exacerbated by Sanchez's already pull-heavy approach.   Take solace in the fact that he is only 19 and doesn't turn 20 until April, and that his assignment to full season ball in 2018 was very aggressive. He also remains fast and quite good in center field. He looked much more like a fourth outfielder in 2018 than a table-setting center fielder, but there's lots of time to bounce back. \"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","","\"July 15, 2015 - PIT\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Signed by the Pirates in July 2015 out of the Dominican Republic for $450,000, Sanchez burst on the prospect scene with a very strong United States debut in the Gulf Coast League in 2017, leaving everyone excited to see what he would do as an encore. The speedster did finish fourth in the organization with 30 steals in 2018, but did not respond well overall to an aggressive push to the full-season South Atlantic League.  Sanchez's kryptonite in 2018 was the offspeed pitch. He hits fastballs very well and feasted on them in the GCL, but once he started getting a steadier diet of breaking balls and changeups, he often found himself diving and not seeing them come in because of head movement. He's working on fine-tuning his swing so he can stay centered and on his backside longer so he can recognize and respond to the soft stuff better. There is still confidence that the more he sees off-speed pitches, the more he'll learn to recognize it and get back to looking like the top-of-the-order catalyst he was in 2017. The rest of his game is still very good, from the speed to wreak havoc on the basepaths, to playing a very good defensive center field.  Sanchez will be playing at age 20 for most of the 2019 season, so there's still plenty of time for him to figure things out. He did end the 2018 season on an upswing.

His velocity jumped once he got to full-season ball in 2016 and he now has some of the best pure stuff in the system, though he's still learning to harness it.  After sitting around 90 mph with sink on his fastball earlier in his career, Hernandez now deals at 93-97 mph and can reach 99, getting groundouts with his two-seamer and throwing his four-seamer by hitters up in the strike zone. His slider has gotten quicker as well and now grades as a plus pitch that can lock up right-handers, and he has an effective curveball as well. His changeup has also improved, with its tumble helping him handle left-handers, though it can get a bit firm at times.  To become a mid-rotation starter, Hernandez will need to pair his present stuff with his previous control and command.

He opened even more eyes with Hudson Valley after the trade, turning in five dominant starts to finish his New York-Penn League campaign with a 3.54 ERA, a 0.98 WHIP and a 73-to-10 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 56 innings.

Myers works with a lively fastball that will sit 92-95 mph with late life. He throws his curveball with tight spin that gives it late downer action, and scouts believe it will be at least an above-average offering for him once fully developed. Myers also has an advanced changeup, giving him a solid three-pitch mix that should allow him to stick as a starter. He's athletic and repeats both his delivery and arm action well, and club officials have already been impressed with his capacity for making mechanical adjustments since joining the organization.

While Dawson ran well for a hefty, 230 pound former linebacker/fullback, it was assumed that his size would prohibit long term play in center field and that his arm strength would limit him to left. He has worked doggedly to improve both those issues. Weighted ball work has helped improve his arm, and he's now considerably leaner than he was in college. He's also faster, and shags batting practice fly balls with intense focus. He's willed himself to become viable in center field, which gives him a real shot at becoming an everyday player because Dawson has more raw juice than is typical for center fielders.

Signed for $1,056,800, he scuffled in his pro debut, didn't prepare well for his first Spring Training and looked overwhelmed in his introduction to full-season ball early in 2017. After making adjustments and getting in better shape, he looked much better in Double-A and the Arizona Fall League last season.  One of the top college power hitters in the 2016 Draft, Dawson offers bat speed and strength from the left side of the plate.

Though he doesn't throw that hard, Reyes' propels himself way down the mound and has super long arms that help him generate big extension, which help his upper-80s fastball play like one in the low-90s.

Signed with no fanfare for $90,000 out of the Dominican Republic that July, Reyes has pounded the strike zone and dominated everywhere he has gone since. The low Class A South Atlantic League named him its pitcher of the year in 2018, when he ranked second in the Minors in WHIP (0.91), fourth in ERA (1.97) and K/BB ratio (7.6) and fifth in walk rate (1.1 per nine innings).  Reyes derives his success from uncanny command, a knack for sequencing his pitches and deception. His fastball works from 88-92 mph with ordinary life, but plays better than its velocity because he uses his 6-foot-4 frame and high arm slot to create extension and downhill plane. His changeup is his most reliable secondary offering and his low-80s slider/cutter is more effective than his mid-70s curveball, which has shape but lacks power.  Reyes has supreme pitchability but his body is fairly maxed out, so he probably won't throw much harder. He has little margin for error but rarely made mistakes while averaging 0.9 walks per nine innings during his first four pro seasons. While it's hard to give him a ceiling higher than a No. 5 starter, he's intelligent, determined and gets the most out of his ability.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"AA\"","19","\"2015 J2 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"55.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2250","45","45","45","45","","","","60","50","50","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","45","50","","","","60","","",""],["417","414","444","507","418","\"45.6\"","\"45.1\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Kyle\"","\"Funkhouser\"","2019","\"25.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","1260","608335","\"funkhouser_kyle\"","","\"sa827397\"","\"|\"","","\"Louisville\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","40","\"j-b1ZwTMYNY\"","","\"Funkhouser was a classic Louisville recruit who wasn't touted much at a Midwestern high school, then stood out immediately on campus as an early-round pick.

At his best, Funkhouser shows a 55 or 60 fastball and curveball along with an average changeup and command, for a No. 3 or 4 starter type profile. He did that for most of 2015, which led to being a first round pick, then was less consistent from that point forward.

Rather than sign, the right-hander bet on himself and headed back to school for his senior season. That decision didn't go as well as planned and after an uneven season, he ended up landing in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. While injuries have slowed Funkhouser's progress, it still looks like the Tigers got a serious bargain. He pitched his was up to the Florida State League in his first full season and would have reached Double-A if not for a bout of elbow inflammation. The elbow wasn't a problem for Funkhouser in 2018, but he did suffer a broken foot (while walking on an uneven sidewalk) that ended his season in late July after he had made two starts in Triple-A.   When he's healthy, Funkhouser will sit in the low 90s and can reach back for 95 mph. He has a trio of secondary pitches that receive average grades from evaluators. Funkhouser's slider continues to be ahead of his fringy curveball, though he does land the latter for strikes and uses it in any count. He's made progress developing a changeup to the point where it's regarded as an average big league offering, with room to improve. Facing Double- and Triple-A hitters for the first time last year led to a regression in Funkhouser's control, but he's generally around the zone with all four pitches, with feel for sequencing that leads to weak contact and a solid number of whiffs.   Despite his season-ending injuries in back-to-back years, Funkhouser still has been able to move through the Minors relatively fast and will open 2019 on the cusp of the Majors. A strong performance back in Triple-A should help him get there, while further improvements to his secondary arsenal and command could help him reach his potential as a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"AAA\"","14","\"2016 Draft Rnd 4 (DET)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"51.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2450","40","55","45","","55","","","50","55","50","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","45","50","","","","50","\"OAK\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["418","415","359","340","508","\"45.6\"","\"45.6\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","\"Sam\"","\"Hilliard\"","2019","\"25.3\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"77\"","\"238\"","\"professional\"","80","2","\"|\"","927","656541","\"hilliard_sam\"","","\"sa829542\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2015, 15th (437) - COL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Hilliard was known more as a pitcher early in his amateur days, even getting drafted as a left-hander by the Twins when he was in junior college in 2014.

He's shown glimpses of putting his tools into production, playing 2018 in Double-A, then really standing out with a strong Arizona Fall League performance to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.  On any given day, Hilliard will show all five tools. Given that he didn't really start focusing on his offensive game until college, he's still learning to hit. He made some adjustments to his swing at the end of his 2018 season, adding a small leg kick to replace a toe tap with strong results, especially in the AFL. It allowed him to keep his weight back, wait on breaking balls more and lay off of ones out of the strike zone, something that has previously plagued him. It should help him tap into his easily plus raw power more consistently. He runs very well for his size and while he has seen time in all three outfield spots, he fits the profile of an athletic power-hitting right fielder with a plus arm.

It's a long, swooping, side-winding look that creates cut/rise on the ball. He also throws a hard, horizontal slider. The Trackman readout for Doval is shocking. His primary fastball/cutter spins in at about 2700 rpm, which is incredible considering how how hard he throws. He also generates nearly seven feet of extension, and the effective velocity of his fastball is about 2 mph harder than it's actual velo. He has outings where he walks everyone and gives up a bunch of runs before he accrues an out, and he has outings where he's untouchable for several innings.

The Padres, after seeing him throw several bullpen sessions at Petco Park, used the first of their five Day 1 picks on Quantrill, selecting him eighth overall and signing him for above slot value at $3,963,045. The Ontario native reached Double-A in his first full season, then suited up for the World Team in the All-Star Futures Game.  Quantrill's arsenal is deep even if no singular pitch is devastating. It's headlined by two plus pitches -- a low-to-mid 90s fastball and a low-80s changeup that he commands impeccably. His slider and curveball can be inconsistent, but Quantrill seemed to gain a better feel for the two offerings toward the end of his 2018 season. His numbers improved significantly upon his promotion to Triple-A El Paso in August, but he could still do a better job of using his breaking pitches to generate swings and misses.  In his first two full professional seasons, Quantrill reached 116 and 148 innings, respectively, as he put to rest any lingering concerns about his health. The reins will be fully off Quantrill in 2019. His impressive blend of size, stuff and pitchability make him a candidate to join the Padres' rotation at some point midseason.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"MLB\"","26","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (SDP)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"50.7\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2050","2400","40","50","55","45","45","","","50","50","60","50","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","60","50","50","","","","55","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["425","422","414","503","358","\"45.5\"","\"45.2\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.2\"","\"46.8\"","\"50.5\"","\"|\"","\"Erik\"","\"Miller\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"77\"","\"220\"","\"draft\"","325","8","\"|\"","1769","","\"miller_erik\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Stanford\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","\"h2OKxijUEkg\"","\"Miller gave scouts varied looks on the Cape this summer but, at his best, was sitting in the mid-90's, hit 97, flashed a plus breaker and starter traits.\"","\"Miller gave scouts varied looks on the Cape this summer but, at his best, was sitting in the mid-90's, hit 97, flashed a plus breaker and starter traits.\"","\"|\"","\"Stanford\"","","","","","50","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-erik-miller-lhp-c2520576783?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50    Miller was a known pitching prospect coming out of De Smet Jesuit High School in Missouri, but went undrafted in 2016, largely because of his strong commitment to Stanford. He's been in the Cardinal's rotation for nearly all of his three years in school, pitching midweek as a freshman and then on the weekend the last two seasons. He's performed well as a junior, helping to erase a subpar Cape Cod League performance, though scouts aren't sure what his future role might be.  From a size and pure stuff standpoint, Miller checks off the boxes. The 6-foot-5, 240-pound southpaw has the chance to have three pitches at his disposal. His fastball touches 96-97 mph at times, and his velocity has crept upwards this spring after starting the spring at 88-92 mph. He complements the heater well with a slider that's plus at times and he'll flash an above-average changeup as well. Miller has struggled with command, with a stiff front side that has kept him from finding the strike zone consistently enough.  Pure stuff-wise, Miller could be put side-by-side, if not ahead of, some of the college lefties ahead of him on Draft boards. His command and delivery issues have led some evaluators to see a future in the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination from the left side could lead to a Josh Hader-like role in the future.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","","23","\"2019 Draft Rnd 4 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","76","120","\"PHI\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"52.1\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","0.5000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","40","55","50","50","","","50","45","60","55","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","","60","","","","45","","",""],["426","423","348","396","436","\"45.5\"","\"45.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"49.7\"","\"41.0\"","\"50.5\"","\"|\"","\"Kyle\"","\"Isbel\"","2019","\"22.2\"","\"RF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"183\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2449","664728","\"isbel_kyle\"","","\"sa3006861\"","\"|\"","","\"UNLV\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","42","\"sigx6-kC_Bg\"","","\"Isbel hit .319 and .290 as a freshman and sophomore, respectively, and then grew into a new grade of power in his junior year while maintaining his contact skills and taking advantage of pitchers' newfound hesitance to attack him in the zone. None of his tools are especially loud, but Isbel does several things fairly well and he has a slight chance to play a passable big league center field.

When a player like Isbel, who jumped on the map with an All-Star performance on the Cape, carries it over to a big junior season, that's even better. That's exactly what the three-year UNLV starter did, catapulting himself into the third round then going out and having a big pro debut.  Isbel has a good feel for the strike zone to go along with deceptive strength to make him a very intriguing hitting prospect. He started tapping into his power as a junior with a more leveraged swing. With that has come more length, and it will be interesting to see how he reacts to fastballs up in the zone as he progresses. He isn't big, but there is power there, and his swing reminds some of Scooter Gennett's. While he's not a top-of-the-scale speedster, he's an excellent baserunner who can steal a base, one who will continue to hit leadoff in the Minors, even if he doesn't settle in there once he reaches the big leagues. Similarly, he can handle center field, but could easily end up sliding to left in deference to a faster teammate in center.   He's worked a little at second base, a position he played as a freshman at UNLV, but he's unlikely to see any game action for now. It gives him the possibility for flexibility should his advanced bat be ready to find a place in the lineup, in a Whit Merrifield kind of situation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","\"A+\"","11","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.2\"","\"50.9\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","50","50","45","50","50","50","50","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","60","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["427","424","869","760","1095","\"45.4\"","\"42.5\"","\"41.4\"","\"45.0\"","\"43.6\"","\"45.1\"","\"|\"","\"Myles\"","\"Straw\"","2019","\"24.6\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2070","664702","","17620","\"sa875569\"","\"|\"","","\"St. John's River JC (FL)\"","2","1","","\"Low\"","2019","40","","","\"One of the more unusual players in the minors, Straw has long been considered a likely bench outfielder due to his complete lack of power, but his other tools may prove to be so strong that he finds his way into an everyday role for someone. Straw has one of the lowest Pull% in pro baseball, as only 27% of balls he puts in play are to his pull side. His 70-grade speed plays like an 80 from home to first, as his swing has a natural jailbreak that gets him out of the box very quickly. He lead the minors with 70 stolen bases last year, his closing speed is very valuable in center field, and Straw is a tough out thanks to his feel for the strike zone and bat control. Players like this occasionally turn into Michael Bourn or Ender Inciarte and provide sizeable everyday value. Straw's skillset indicates this sort of future is a possibility, but not a likelihood, and chances are he's either a low-end regular in center or good fourth outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","\"HOU\"","\"2015, 12th (349) - HOU\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 20 | Run: 70 | Arm: 65 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  The Astros' analytics department liked Straw's .413 batting average and 8 percent strikeout rate as a St. John's River (Fla.) CC sophomore in 2015 and their scouts bought in after his pre-Draft workout, so the club signed him for $100,000 as a 12th-rounder. He led the Minors in hitting (.358) during his first full pro season and in steals (70) in 2018. He made enough of an impression during his brief playing time as a September callup to earn a spot on Houston's postseason roster.  One of the more unusual prospects in baseball, Straw gets at least plus grades on four of his five tools from some evaluators yet has such an extreme approach that he may not make enough offensive impact to play regularly in the Majors. A right-handed hitter, he excels at controlling the strike zone and making contact, but he lets the ball travel so deep that he mostly generates ground balls to the opposite field. He has the bat speed and strength to produce some power, as evidenced by his 395-foot home run to right-center with the Astros in September, yet he hit just three homers and slugged .376 in his first four Minor League seasons.  Straw's plus-plus speed enables him to turn grounders into hits and he has become more aggressive as a basestealer while succeeding at an 86 percent clip over the last two seasons. His quickness also allows him to cover plenty of ground in center field and his well above-average arm is unusually strong for the position and fits anywhere in the outfield. He played his first pro game at shortstop last July and has seen more action there in 2019 in an attempt to enhance his versatility.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"MLB\"","19","\"2015 Draft Rnd 12 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"41.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","2.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","20","30","70","60","55","55","20","30","70","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","20","70","65","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["428","425","658","761","724","\"45.4\"","\"43.6\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.1\"","\"45.6\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Hermosillo\"","2019","\"24.4\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1930","641684","","16285","\"sa738413\"","\"|\"","","\"Ottawa HS (IL)\"","1","1","","\"Low\"","2019","40","\"D0OSPvncrZs\"","","\"It took a $100,000 bonus to sign Hermosillo away from a football scholarship to Illinois. Understandably raw when he entered pro ball (what with two-sports and a cold-weather background), it took Hermosillo three years of adjustments before he finally experienced a statistical breakout in 2016. Since then, he has continued to make mechanical tweaks to reshape his skillset, and was rewarded with a brief major league debut in 2018.   Once in possession of ugly bat control that enabled him to put lots of balls in play but not with any real impact, Hermosillo's most recent swing adjustment has him trading some of that contact for power. As Hermosillo's leg kick grew bigger and slower, his ground ball rate shrunk. A 45% roller ratio in 2017 became 31% in 2018, and Hermosillo set a career-high in homers (12) in the friendly confines of the PCL. Though he didn't perform during a 30-game big league look, Hermosillo's athleticism and ability to make adjustments bode well for his future. His baseball instincts aren't great, but he has some pop that he's started to get to, he can fly, and he may get lots of playing time due to the Angels' fairly thin outfield situation. Realistically, he projects as a good bench outfielder, but he has several late-bloomer traits and may continue to develop into a low-end regular if he falls into regular big league reps and gets sufficient at-bats.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2013, 28th (847) - LAA\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  The Angels took a flier on Hermosillo, an athletic two-sport high school standout, giving him $100,000 to sign as a 28th-round pick in 2013. It's taken a while, but he really started to repay their faith and patience in him in '16, with an .869 OPS across two levels of A ball. He played at three levels in '17, got added to the 40-man roster that offseason and made his big league debut in 2018.  Hermosillo continues to be a professional hitter, one who can hit for average and get on base. He can drive the ball to all fields and showed more over-the-fence power in Triple-A in 2018 with a career-high 12 homers, mostly to his pull side. His strikeout rate went up as a result, but he still draws enough walks to help offset it. Hermosillo's speed works on both sides of the ball -- he led the system with 35 steals in 2017 -- and it gives him the range to cover plenty of ground in all three outfield spots.  A sports hernia that slowed him late in 2018 eventually needed offseason surgery, but isn't expected to be a long-range concern.

Most scouts who saw him early in his draft spring thought he was a 55 runner who fit best in left field but didn't think he'd have the power to profile there. Thus, they considered Stowers to be a bit of a tweener or the wrong side of a left field platoon, which is roughly where we had him pre-draft. Scouts who stayed on him (and knew they were the high scouts, so generally kept it to themselves) saw a 60 runner who could be average in center field, where a 50 or 55 bat with 45 power would be above average offense for the position. Enough people think that the second scenario is likely that we've notched him up to a strong 40 FV, and if Stowers performs like the believers think he can for all of 2019, he may be a 45 FV at the end of the year. He started hitting more down the stretch when he used a flatter planed swing, so it appears lifting the ball isn't the swing that best suits him.

After he settled down and was one of college baseball's hottest hitters down the stretch, the Mariners took him in the second round and signed him for $1.1 million. They traded him seven months later, shipping him to the Yankees for second-base prospect Shed Long in a three-team deal that sent Sonny Gray to the Reds.  Stowers improved once he shortened his right-handed swing and focused on hitting line drives instead of trying to drive the ball. He has modest power, enough to produce maybe 15 homers on an annual basis, and his best offensive attributes are his on-base ability and solid speed. He has a very patient approach and the savvy to steal bases.   Stowers will have a better chance of profiling as a regular if he can remain in center field.

Oliva's feel for contact is still somewhat clumsy and he remains a power-over-hit offensive performer at the plate, but he's an athlete in the classic center field mold, like Drew Stubbs and Cameron Maybin, and is very likely to play there for a while.

He was sent straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League for his full season debut and excelled there, putting him on a path to easily surpass expectations.  Lean and athletic with wiry strength, Oliva can do a lot of things well on the field. While there was some concern about swing and miss coming from a grooved swing, Oliva managed his strikeout rate well and drew walks while showing the ability to consistently impact the ball. Nine home runs might not sound like a lot, but in the pitching-friendly Florida State League, it's not bad and he has the potential for 12-15 homers a year. His speed is plus, and sometimes grades out as a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, allowing him to be a basestealing threat (he finished third in the system with 33 steals in 2018) and allowing him to play a solid defensive center field.

But it has plateaued and Abbott now projects as a low-variance fifth starter. Abbott's fastball plays best when it's moving most, which for him is when he's locating it just off the plate to his arm side; it is hittable everywhere else, including up above the zone. He can locate there, but Abbott is limited in where he can attack with the fastball, which also makes it harder for him to set up his breaking balls.

He has breezed through pro ball since the Cubs drafted him in the second round, leading the system with a 2.50 ERA in his first full season in 2018.  Abbott relies heavily on his cut fastball, command and deception. His cutter sits in the upper 80s with sharp lateral break that keeps it off barrels. He works from 90-93 mph with a four-seam fastball that's more effective than its velocity because he spots it on the edges of the strike zone.

After ranking second among national junior college pitchers in strikeout rate (14.1 per nine innings), he signed for a below-slot $450,000 as a third-rounder. In a system filled with pitchers who missed bats, he ranked second among qualified starters in whiff rate (10.8) last year while reaching Class A Advanced.  Ivey gets his strikeouts by changing hitters' eye level and attacking them with 90-95 mph four-seam fastballs with riding life at the letters before dropping upper-70s curveballs through the bottom of the strike zone. He has sharpened his slider in pro ball and shows the makings of an effective changeup.  Though Ivey could have four average-or-better pitches when fully developed and is throwing strikes more consistently as a pro, he still could wind up in the bullpen. There's a lot going on in his delivery, which features effort and some head whack, so he'll have to prove he has enough command and durability to make it as a starter.

It's especially tough on lefties, who have a .224 OBP against Lovelady each of the  last two years. Lovelady also has better command, especially breaking ball command, than most relievers. He'll be able to get swings and misses from righties by way of back foot sliders, and he can beat them in the zone with his heater.

He ended up sliding a bit into the third round, where the Twins took him and gave him a well-above-pick-value bonus of $2 million to sign him away from LSU. While he did have two stints on the disabled list, with a back strain and ankle sprain, during his first full season, he did have a solid, albeit unspectacular performance in the Midwest League.  Enlow entered pro ball with a three-pitch mix that has now grown to four. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, often touching 95 mph, and there's still reason to believe there's more in the tank. While his curveball was his calling card as he entered pro ball, it wasn't as sharp in 2018, thrown in the 81-82 mph range. He added in a hard 86-87 mph slider that grades out as average and can mix in an average changeup as well. He needs to continue to get stronger and maintain his mechanics on his delivery in order to help him command the baseball more consistently, though there are no real red flags there.  Enlow will focus on getting his curveball back to the plus offering it was in order to give him a true swing-and-miss out pitch.

He's been a workhorse since, topping 150 IP in each of his two full seasons of pro ball, and he led the Triple-A International League in ERA in '18.  Irvin's success comes from his ability to use his four-pitch mix well to keep hitters guessing and off-balance, though his stuff largely grades out as Major League average. His fastball velocity did regress a bit in 2018, down to staying in the 90-91 mph range, showing the ability to throw his two-seamer down in the zone with sink to get ground-ball outs.

He pitched his way to Double-A in 2018 and finished second in the organization with 26 saves.  Humphreys misses a lot of bats with a deeper repertoire than most relievers. He can run his four-seam fastball up to 97-98 mph at times, but he uses his low-90s cutter as his primary fastball and it has solid average cut to it. He does a nice job at mixing in his low-80s slider and even has a changeup that can help him neutralize left-handed hitters.

After returning in late April in 2017 and pitching well in short stints, the Rays took the right-hander with the 31st pick in the Draft. Citing discrepancies between the pre-Draft and post-Draft MRIs, the Rays didn't sign Rasmussen. He was set to return to the Beavers' pitching staff when he required a second TJ surgery in September, missing the entire season. The Brewers, believing that Rasmussen would make a full recovery, selected him in the sixth round of the 2018 Draft and signed him for $135,000. Making his pro debut in 2019, Rasmussen rewarded the organization by ascending three levels to Double-A within the first month of the season.   Fully healthy after a pair of TJ surgeries, Rasmussen has returned to showcase an impressive mix of power offerings despite being limited by the Brewers both in his pitch count and overall workload. His fastball registers in the mid-to-upper 90s with riding life, giving him the ability to beat hitters inside the zone. He pairs his heater with a hard slider at 88-91 mph, while his changeup in the upper 80s gives him another very effective secondary offering, albeit with room for improvement. His feel for pitching has returned faster than initially expected, and he's impressed in 2019 with his ability to both throw strikes and generate whiffs.   With three effective pitches and a starter's delivery, Rasmussen has the ingredients to be effective in the role so long as he stays healthy.

Named Mr. Tennessee Football at the Division II 3-A level last fall, Hampton not only is one of the Draft's top outfielders but also a four-star cornerback ticketed to play two sports at Louisiana State if he doesn't turn pro. The most athletic prospect to come out of Tennessee in years, he could become the state's first prep position player to go in the first round since Mike White in 1986.  Like most athletes who star in multiple sports, Hampton needs refinement on the diamond, but his huge upside could make the patience that will be required in his development worth it. His right-handed swing could get smoother but still generates impressive bat speed and exit velocities, giving him the potential for 25 or more homers on an annual basis if he makes enough contact. He struggled against quality pitching early on the showcase circuit last summer but continually improved and gave a glimpse of what he might be if he focused on baseball.  Hampton has dynamic tools beyond his raw power. He's also a well above-average runner who can make an impact as a basestealer and a defender.

He's very short to the ball, but his swing still has natural lift to his pull side, and he can pull most anything because of how short the swing is.

They promoted him aggressively, starting the Cuban defector in low Class A at age 18 and promoting him to high Class A at 19, and he showed little consistency at the plate for most of his first three pro seasons. He seemed to turn a corner when he batted .340/.418/.547 in the final six weeks of 2018, finishing the year as the high Class A California League leader in runs (87) and doubles (43).  Estevez has an unorthodox batting style in which his lower half tends to leak out while his shoulders remain square to the ball. During his late-season tear, he was more patient and hammered balls from gap to gap instead of trying to pull everything to left field. With his efficient right-handed stroke and advanced pitch-recognition skills, he could become a .275 hitter with 15 or more homers per year if he can maintain a disciplined approach.  Estevez's quick hands and internal clock have helped him survive at shortstop, his primary position in two years in high Class A, but it will be a stretch for him to play there regularly in the Majors. His speed and arm are fringy and better suited for second base, where he can be an average defender.

After a huge pro debut in the summer of 2017, Rooker was pushed to Double-A for his first full season, where he hit for power, but saw other parts of his offensive game regress.  There is no question that Rooker's best position is batter's box. He's looking more like a power-over-hit type of offensive player, one with legitimate raw pop. He's always had swing and miss to his game, and his strikeout rate spiked with the aggressive move to Double-A. It's offset somewhat by his ability to draw walks and there's some hope that at his peak, he'll be a bit more well-rounded as a hitter than he was in 2018. He should be a good enough hitter for that power to play at any level.  The big question surrounding Rooker is where he might play defensively. He saw time at first and left field in 2018, and the plan is to give him a consistent time split at both. He's below-average in both spots, with the hope that he can become adequate enough at one so he's not a DH at a very young age.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"AAA\"","13","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","6","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"49.1\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","45","65","40","40","40","40","60","65","40","45","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","60","50","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["443","440","358","394","435","\"45.4\"","\"45.6\"","\"44.3\"","\"49.7\"","\"39.4\"","\"50.6\"","\"|\"","\"Lazaro\"","\"Armenteros\"","2019","\"20.0\"","\"LF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"182\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1074","670860","","","\"sa969091\"","\"|\"","","\"Cuba\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"vc84x37Htwg\"","","\"One of the last teenage Cuban prospects to leave the island before a new CBA implemented a hard-slotted international bonus system, Lazarito remains a polarizing and volatile prospect. Teams left his amateur workouts with widely varying opinions about his talent, especially his defensive future, and the situation became more unsettled when his American agent had to cut ties with him after receiving death threats from Lazaritos Latin American trainer/investor. Once that situation resolved, Armenteros signed for $3 million, then came stateside and looked concerningly raw, but clearly talented. His timing and breaking ball recognition were especially poor, but he hadn't seen live pitching for a long time, meaning it could have been due to rust. As the spring and summer of 2017 wore on, he started to develop a much better feel at the plate and by the fall of 2017, was hitting lasers to all fields off of curated instructional-league pitching.   The Athletics pushed him to Low-A as a 19-year-old in 2018 and Armenteros posted a serviceable .277/.374/.401 line while striking out at a disquieting 34% clip. The K% is less worrisome because of his age, but he does have a bat path that limits the scope of his contact and some kinetic connectivity issues that cause him to rely solely on his dynamic hand speed to generate power. His arm limits him to left field, and he needs to rake to hit enough for that. He has the physical talent to do so, but there are some mechanical and statistical indications that he may not.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - OAK\"","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Armenteros was one of the top international prospects according to MLB Pipeline in 2016 and the A's liked him enough to go over the spending threshold, incurring penalties when he signed with the A's for $3 million. He had a solid pro debut making his way to the United States and the rookie-level Arizona League in 2017, then showed glimpses of his tools during a full-season debut that was interrupted by injury.  Armenteros has the chance to have four at-least average tools at the Major League level. He has plus bat speed that makes it easy to project the ability to hit for average with potentially plus power down the road. He's not afraid to see pitches and draw walks, though he needs to continue to refine his overall approach and pitch recognition in order to cut down his strikeout rate, which was 33.8 percent in 2018.   While he does have excellent speed, he is expected to slow down some as he matures. He's largely played left field, likely his long-term home given his fringy arm strength.

But his velocity and performance began to decline in late March, leaving scouts unsure what to make of him.    When he was going great, Henry commanded all three of his pitches well. He operated at 91-92 mph and peaked at 94 with high spin rates on his fastball. He got swings and misses with a changeup with fade and a slider with depth, both of which arrived in the low 80s.    Henry generated a bunch of ugly swings when he was on top of his game but hasn't since his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches haven't been as sharp.

After the trade, his walk rate regressed to his career norm, but he continued missing bats and struck out 35% of opposing hitters.   Sandovals fastball sits 88-92 and will top out around 94. He can really spin a 12-6 curveball, one thats above average when he is getting on top of it. Effectively, Sandoval has an almost perfectly vertical arm slot, but the way he gets there is somewhat odd, and theres some skepticism among scouts as to the sustainability of last years uptick in strike-throwing. But his current delivery enables him to effectively work up and down with his fastball and curveball in sequence, so nobody suggests he change it. Theres enough of a changeup here for continued development in a rotation and if everything clicks, Sandoval will be a No. 4 or 5 starter.

The left-hander made very little progress as a pro until 2018, when he earned a promotion from the Midwest to the Carolina League before being sent to the Angels for catcher Martin Maldonado close to the Trade Deadline, and he finished the year up one more level in Double-A.  The Angels might have gotten on the Sandoval train at precisely the right time as he turned in one of the best performances of any left-handed pitching prospect in the game in 2018. While there isn't a true plus pitch in his arsenal, Sandoval does have three above-average offerings and showed tremendous feel for all of them during his breakout. While his fastball averaged at 91 mph, it played up because of its movement and his command of it. The biggest difference maker last year might have been the development of his changeup, which he throws with terrific arm speed and deception, leading to both swings and misses as well as weak contact. His slow, deep curve also flashes plus and he effectively mixes in a slider.  Doubters will want to see Sandoval repeat his success.

Jennings can really spin it but his velocity has waxed and waned as a pro, hovering anywhere between the upper-80s and low-80s. Each of his two breaking balls has premium raw spin, but Jennings release of them, epsecially the slider, hasn't become consistent enough yet for them to play like plus pitches.

The Pirates went over slot to give him $1.9 million to sign rather than head to Mississippi. While the results on paper don't look great, the Pirates are still very bullish on his combination of athleticism and feel for pitching.  Jennings will rely on his ability to command his four-pitch mix, rather than be that prototypical projectable power pitcher. Very athletic on the mound, he has the chance to have above-average control of all four offerings. His fastball typically sits around average, though he can reach back for 94 mph on occasion. Without a big frame, there might not be a ton of strength to add, so this might be more or less where he stands velocity-wise. The good news is that he does a nice job using his fastball, two distinct breaking balls -- the Pirates like the slider a little bit more than the curve but they do complement each other -- and his changeup to keep hitters from barreling up the baseball.  Some evaluators see some Mike Leake in Jennings as an athletic right-hander with a repeatable delivery who will use command and savvy to get big league hitters out.

The following spring he felt elbow discomfort, had a PRP injection that didn't work out, and finally had Tommy John in October.

After his elbow continued to bother him that fall in instructional league, Kline underwent Tommy John surgery that cost him all of 2016, as well as a pair arthroscopic surgeries to address lodged tissue in the joint line in his right elbow that kept him off the mound again the following year. Finally healthy in '18, Kline made his return from a 59-month absence with a scoreless outing out of the bullpen at Class A Advanced Frederick on Minor League Opening Day. He only improved from there, earning a promotion to Double-A Bowie in May and then pitching to a 1.80 ERA with 15 saves and a sub-.200 opponent average in the Eastern League. With Kline's career back on track, the Orioles added him to their 40-man roster in November.   Kline's electric fastball-slider pairing is ideal for a late-inning role. He showed the same velocity in 2018 as he did pre-injury, sitting in the mid-90s and bumping 97-98 mph, all while using his 6-foot-3 frame to create a downhill angle to the plate. Kline's slider registers in the mid-80s, flashes plus and is highly effective against right-handed hitters. He'll also mix in the occasional changeup, an average pitch for which he has good feel. Kline has long been a strike-thrower, but he will need to refine his command after his extended layoff.  A starting pitcher before his injuries, Kline now has a bright future as a big league reliever.

He has a quick left-handed swing and plenty of strength, so he could develop 20-25 homer pop as he learns to turn on pitches more often. He doesn't sell out for home runs, however, employing a patient approach and utilizing the whole field.  While most of Decker's value will come from his offense, he's a decent athlete. Though he projects as a fringy runner once he's physically mature, his keen instincts give him an outside chance to stay in center field. More likely, he'll move to an outfield corner. He has enough arm strength for right field.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"A-\"","6","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"33.6\"","\"52.3\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","25","55","50","40","55","50","55","60","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","45","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["451","448","410","494","310","\"45.3\"","\"45.2\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.6\"","\"44.8\"","\"51.1\"","\"|\"","\"Matt\"","\"Canterino\"","2019","\"21.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","325","8","\"|\"","2850","","\"canterino_matt\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Rice\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","\"Canterino will regularly show a plus fastball/breaker combo, but there's some effort and relief risk.

He swiftly emerged as Rice's No. 1 starter and led Conference USA with 111 strikeouts in 96 innings as a freshman in 2017. One of two college hurlers (Elon's Kyle Brnovich is the other) to reach triple digits in each of the last three years, he also pitched with the U.S. collegiate national team and won the Cape Cod League all-star game last summer.    Conference USA's 2019 pitcher of the year, Canterino usually deals at 90-93 mph and tops out at 96 with his fastball, and his high-three-quarters arm slot creates more downward plane than true life. He has added velocity to his slider, which now arrives in the mid-80s with impressive depth and has become his best pitch. His upper-70s spike curveball has nice downer action as well.    Because his breaking pitches have been effective against both left-handers and right-handers, Canterino hasn't had to rely on his changeup much at the college level. He has an unorthodox delivery with a lot of effort, leading to some questions about his suitability as a long-term starter in pro ball. But he makes it work and hasn't had any difficulty controlling his pitches, so he'll get every opportunity to stick in a rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","","32","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","109","54","\"MIN\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.3\"","\"51.7\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","0.2500","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","50","40","50","","","","50","55","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","55","60","","","","55","","",""],["452","449","385","495","387","\"45.3\"","\"45.3\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"50.2\"","\"|\"","\"Lewis\"","\"Thorpe\"","2019","\"23.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"R\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"218\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","1029","626929","","","\"sa739599\"","\"|\"","","\"Australia\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"Txe_vF8DcKE\"","\" \"","\"Two consecutive seasons lost to a combination of Tommy John rehab and mononucleosis highlight a robust, early-career injury history for Thorpe, who has been encouragingly healthy for the last two years.

A 6% walk rate in 2018 was comfortably Thorpe's career best, which may be real development or just something that will regress to Thorpe's career mean. It's No. 4 or 5 starter stuff from an arm whose injury history, which one could argue should soon be expunged, moves him toward the back of that FV group.

He got off to a great start at the lower levels of Minnesota's system then started running into elbow troubles, getting shut down in 2014 and needing Tommy John surgery that cost him the 2015 season. He missed 2016 as well when he contracted mono during rehab, finally returning and shaking off the rust the following year. He topped 100 innings in a season for the first time in his career in 2018, reaching Triple-A, pitching in the Futures Game and leading the organization in strikeouts in the process.  While he may no longer be the high-ceilinged potential frontline starter the Twins hoped he might be, there is a little more certainty that he can be a big league starter now that he's put in a full, healthy season. He has a solid four-pitch mix and can fill the strike zone with all of them using a clean delivery. He commands his low-90s fastball well and he can reach back for more velocity when he needs to. He didn't have a good feel for either breaking ball at the start of 2018, but then got on a roll, with his curve really taking a step forward. His curve pairs nicely with his fastball to create a good two-pitch, north-south profile, and he mixes in his sinking changeup effectively as well.  Those who have been with the organization since Thorpe's signing breathed a huge sigh of relief after his successful 2018 season. He might be more of a mid-to-back of the rotation starter now, but he's finally just about ready to impact the big league staff.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"AAA\"","15","\"2012 J2 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.6\"","\"51.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0004-10-15","2200","2500","45","50","45","60","50","","","50","50","50","60","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","45","","","","50","\"ARI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["453","450","386","496","295","\"45.3\"","\"45.3\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"51.1\"","\"|\"","\"Aaron\"","\"Ashby\"","2019","\"21.0\"","\"LHP\"","\"R\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"181\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","2484","676879","\"ashby_aaron\"","","\"sa3007225\"","\"|\"","","\"Crowder JC (MO)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","\"v72e75qt5lg\"","","\"It became clear during instructional league in Arizona that we were low on Ashby before the draft. Despite his clear issues-- he has below average command caused by an arm slot that makes it hard for him to work in all parts of the zone--Ashby has nasty, left-handed stuff. He was up to 94 this fall, and the pitch has flat plane and lives in the top part of the zone, where it sneaks past barrels. Ashby's two breaking balls need better demarcation, but they each flash plus and his changeup flashes average. He turns 21 in May, and should carve up the lower levels of the minor leagues with his stuff alone. His ability to locate and effectively mix his pitches will dictate his ultimate role and how fast he moves. For now, Ashby fairly conservatively projects in a multi-inning relief role. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2018, 4th (125) - MIL\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 65 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  Andy Ashby pitched at Park Hill High (Kansas City, Mo.) and Crowder (Mo.) JC before embarking on a 14-year big league career. His nephew Aaron, meanwhile, is already following the same path. After turning down the Rangers as a 25th-round Draft pick, he returned to the Roughriders and emerged as one of the top junior college pitching prospects, leading all Division I JUCO pitchers in strikeouts (156) and strikeout rate (18.8 per nine innings). The Brewers made Ashby their fourth-round pick in June, signed him for slightly above slot value and then watched him carve up hitters while reaching Class A Wisconsin, where he posted double-digit strikeouts in two of his seven starts.  Ashby's curveball is nasty, a true plus pitch that he can also manipulate to have harder, slider-like action. He opened his sophomore season throwing in the upper 80s but now sits 91-94 mph and can touch 96. His changeup is a distant third pitch, and there's been some thought within the organization about having him a throw a splitter instead. Ashby works from the third-base side of the mound and has an athletic but funky delivery that masks everything he throws with deception.  Ashby's delivery also can hamper his ability to throw strikes at times, and the Brewers hope to smoothen it out without costing him any of his natural deception. He might not have the cleanest profile and does come with some risk, but Ashby's bat-missing ability is undeniable and could help him rise through the ranks relatively quickly en route to a back-of-the-rotation role, perhaps even more.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"A+\"","10","\"2018 Draft Rnd 4 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.7\"","\"52.9\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2300","40","50","45","55","50","","","50","55","50","60","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","65","","","","","45","","",""],["454","451","387","325","883","\"45.3\"","\"45.3\"","\"45.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","\"Heath\"","\"Quinn\"","2019","\"24.0\"","\"OF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","80","2","\"|\"","1730","641991","\"quinn_heath\"","","\"sa737904\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SF\"","\"2016, 3rd (95) - SF\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Quinn ranked second in NCAA Division I in homers (21), RBIs (77) and total bases (165) at Samford in 2016, becoming the second-highest pick (third round) in Bulldogs history that June. He reached high Class A at the end of his strong pro debut but struggled mightily there in his first full season while dealing with hamate and shoulder injuries. He returned to the California League again in 2018 and reasserted himself as one of the better offensive prospects in the Giants system despite missing time with a hamstring injury.  When Quinn tried to do too much while making up for lost time in 2017, he learned that he's at his best when he focused on making hard contact to all fields as opposed to trying to yank everything out of the park. The strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame give him plenty of natural power that translated into more production last year, when he stopped chasing so many pitches off the plate. He runs well for his size but is a slightly below-average runner.  Quinn fits the right-field profile with his solid power and arm strength. He shows average speed once he gets going and covers ground in the outfield, though not enough to fill in as a center fielder.

He lasted until the sixth round in the 2018 Draft amid signability concerns but still landed a $900,000 bonus, the equivalent of late second-round money. He posted a .790 OPS and ranked third in the Rookie-level Arizona League with 30 walks during his pro debut.

Delgado bounced between shortstop, second base and third base during his debut, and his future defensive home remains in question.

Englert has the makings of a solid four-pitch repertoire that starts with a low-90s sinker that presently tops out at 95 mph and should get quicker as he strengthens his projectable 6-foot-4 frame. He throws two distinct breaking balls, with his low-80s slider with late bite grading slightly better than his downer curveball, which could use more power.

With his quick arm and plenty of room for more strength on his 6-foot-4 frame, he eventually could work in the mid-90s with his heater. He also has improved his power and feel for his slider, which now sits in the low 80s.  After not throwing many changeups as an amateur, Fisher made some progress and showed some fade with the pitch during his debut.

He started to command attention when he reached triple digits with his fastball after making his U.S. debut in 2014, but he's also missed time in four of the last five seasons with injuries. Once one of the Yankees' most highly regarded pitching prospects, he saw his stock take a hit in 2018 when he missed six weeks with blister issues and his velocity dipped.  Though his fastball has been clocked as high as 103 mph, Acevedo spent most of last year working at 92-97. He uses his 6-foot-7 frame and low-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and deception, so his heater can survive on more than sheer velocity. That slot has made it difficult to stay on top of his mid-80s slider, which is more hard than sharp and never has been very reliable.  Acevedo's changeup was less consistent than usual last year, though it can be a plus pitch when he doesn't overthrow it and gets it to dive at the plate.

Using that as motivation, he worked hard to get stronger and make the team as a junior, which led to him getting invited to several summer showcase circuit events. While he showed off a smooth left-handed swing at times, he also fell into the habit of trying to hit for power too much. This spring, a bout with mono slowed him, but also may have enabled him to get back to being a better all-around hitter.  When at his best, Frechette shows the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently. When he first was returning from mono, he shortened up his swing and got to more pitches. He can drive the ball and there is going to be power to tap into as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame, just so long as he doesn't get out of swing to get to it. An above-average athlete, Frechette runs decently for his size and has shown the ability to play both first base and a corner outfield spot capably, with left a likely home should a team want to try him out there.  Players who can hit have the chance to get to their raw power.

Puk in the first round followed by Shore, Puk's college roommate, in the second. While it was Puk who was considered the better prospect, Shore was the more consistent performer, serving as the Gators Friday night starter for three straight years and garnering SEC pitcher of the year honors for his excellent junior campaign. Shore, like Puk, has been plagued by injuries as a pro, with oblique and lat strains costing him portions of his first two seasons, and he was sidelined with a trapezius issue when the A's sent him to the Tigers in September as the player to be named in the Mike Fiers trade.   Shore continues to stand out for ability to command his three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, sitting in the low 90s with late sinking action that nets him many ground balls. His upper-70s changeup is still his best pitch and gives him a chance against left-handed hitters, though it's now more above-average than a true plus pitch. Shore's breaking ball has improved but is still inconsistent overall and a clear third pitch in his arsenal.  Shore has a higher floor than he does ceiling because his profile is centered on his pitchability rather than his pure stuff. He does throw a good amount of strikes, albeit while generating few whiffs, so the potential is there for Shore to be an effective backend starter, perhaps more if his secondaries take a step forward.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","","45","","","","55","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["462","459","395","333","814","\"45.3\"","\"45.3\"","\"45.0\"","\"47.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","\"Osleivis\"","\"Basabe\"","2019","\"18.7\"","\"SS/2B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","80","2","\"|\"","1962","678545","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"TEX\"","","\"Dec. 23, 2017 - TEX\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 70 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  After the Rangers failed to sign Shohei Ohtani and had leftover money in their bonus pool, they pivoted and landed three other premium international prospects, the best of whom is Basabe.

In his 2018 pro debut, Osleivis finished third in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League batting race at .344.  Basabe has some of the best bat-to-ball skills in the Texas system, uses the entire field and controls the strike zone. Some scouts expressed concerns about his hitting ability when he was an amateur but he has calmed down his right-handed swing. He may max out at 12-15 homers per year, though he has some wiry strength and shows occasional pull-side power.  With his on-base ability and plus-plus speed, Basabe could become a dynamic basestealer.

Lavigne has not shown that kind of power with the wooden bats in pro ball and his exit velos are actually a bit below big league average, though that's less worrisome considering his age.

Lavigne, taken earlier than any prep position player from the state when the Rockies selected him 42nd overall in the 2018 Draft, hopes to be the first and showed that he didn't get the memo about not being prepared for pro ball when he led the Rookie level Pioneer League in on-base percentage and finished third in OPS in his summer debut.    Scouts lauded Lavigne's raw power as the Draft approached, seeing his bat speed, strength and 6-foot-4 frame all pointing to future over-the-fence ability, some of which showed up during his first taste of pro ball. There's confidence he'll get to that power because of his advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He works counts, draws a ton of walks and rarely gets fooled, giving him the chance to eventually be a plus hitter with plus power.     While his below-average speed does limit him to first base as a pro, he's surprisingly athletic given his size and has the chance to be a solid defender.

Toglia is a solid athlete, especially given his 6-foot-5 frame that he's still growing into. And as a kid from the Northwest, he's still growing into the game. He's shown huge raw power from both sides of the plate, with some scouts putting a 70 on his raw power, but there are some questions about his ability to make enough contact to tap into it consistently. He wasn't comfortable in the box at the start of the season, but the streaky hitter was starting to put it together.

Short exists at the far right tail of the player population where both of these skills are concerned. He's very similar, statistically, to one-year wonder Ryan Schimpf, except Short has better feel for contact and can actually play shortstop.

Short has quick hands and a pull-heavy approach, giving him more pop than a typical 175-pounder.

Allen's size, or lack there of, is why he fell to the draft's third round, as there was concern he would not have the requisite physicality to hit big league pitching. After a few years of pro ball, scouts think his wrists and forearms are strong enough to put viable contact in play, but probably not with enough force to truly profile as an everyday shortstop.   Sources who have seen Allen and other punchless leatherwizards think the likes of Jose Iglesias and Freddy Galvis had more thump than Allen does at the same age. That's not to say that they don't think Allen is a big leaguer, as everyone thinks he's going to have a very long big league career as an elite defensive shortstop and infield utility man a la Jack Wilson or Adam Everett.

Perhaps the best defensive player in the 2017 Draft, the A's put aside concerns about Allen's strength at the plate and gave him a well-above-slot $2 million bonus in the third round of the Draft. His lack of offensive production has added to the worries about his profile, though he did show improvement in the second half of his first full year.  Allen certainly did struggle in the first half of 2018, hitting just .198 with a. .513 OPS in the Midwest League before the All-Star break. Some of that is because of the aforementioned lack of strength, though the A's think he can add some to help him stay durable, but much of it can be attributed to Allen having to deal with the loss of a family member in early May. In the second half, Allen corrected a little drift in his swing and started impacting the baseball more, posting a .274 average and .679 OPS after the break. His walk rate went up and his strikeout rate dropped as his pitch recognition improved. He also stopped worrying about trying to lift or drive the ball, understanding that consistent contact and on-base skills, combined with his plus speed, are his ticket.   There's never been any question that Allen's glove will carry him to the big leagues. His arm is strong and accurate and he can throw from any angle to go along with his plus range and outstanding hands.

This year it was Young, who hit .285/.363/.445 with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals for the Lugnuts. The travel ball circuit is not kind to economically disadvantaged families, and part of the reason Young was under-scouted as an amateur, as he told our own David Laurila, was because his family could not afford to attend heavily scouted showcases.   Another reason he may have slid toward the end of the draft was because he was constantly moving around. He was under the international scouting umbrella while he was young and living in the Bahamas, then spent his early high school years in Florida before relocating to Georgia for his senior season. It's likely that three separate scouts in each org were responsible for scouting and gauging Young's signability.   The Blue Jays got a deal done for $200,000 and Young has been a strong early-career performer. Pro scouts see him as a bit of a tweener but think there's a chance he might be an everyday center fielder if absolutely everything comes together. He's not a typical center field sprinter (our sources all have either a 50 or 55 on his speed) but he's instinctive, and fine there for now. If Young does move to a corner, his hit/power combination is on the fringe of profiling. A switch-hitter, Young has power from the right side of the plate but he's strikeout prone due to a lack of bat control. As a lefty, he has a gap-to-gap approach and good bat control, but not typical over-the-fence thump.   It's possible that, even with middling offensive ability, Young could be such an excellent corner defender that he plays everyday anyway, and his makeup is universally lauded, so we like his chances of reaching and staying in the majors as some kind of role player.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","","\"Jul. 18, 2016 - TOR\"","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Born and raised in the Bahamas, Young went to high school in Florida for several years before moving to Georgia for his senior campaign in 2016. That he was part of a program for international students at a Christian school likely caused him to fly under the radar during the spring, and it looked as though Young would go undrafted until the Blue Jays took him in the 39th round and signed him for $200,000. He rewarded the organization for its investment by turning in an eye-opening full-season debut in 2018. Spending the entire year in the Midwest League, Young produced a .285/.363/.445 line with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals over 125 games at Class A Lansing.  A switch-hitter with different profiles on each side of the plate, Young projects to hit for more average as a lefty. He'll demonstrate an advanced approach from that side, with a swing that produces line-drive contact across the entire field. His right-handed stroke is more power-oriented, but it also comes with natural swing-and-miss tendencies. He'll draw walks from both sides and generally gets on base at an above-average clip, while his above-average speed makes him a menace on the basepaths. Young's 44 steals tied him for third in the Midwest League, but he'll need to refine his technique and do a better job reading pitchers after being thrown out 13 times.  Much of Young's future value is tied to his ability to stick in center field. He's a solid, if unspectacular defender up the middle, with good range and instincts, as well as arm strength that's among the best in the system and allows him to profile in right field.

Nick (now with the Pirates) was a Twins second-rounder in 2014, while Zack was a White Sox first-rounder two years later and both needed elbow reconstruction in 2017. The younger Burdi, who spent his first full pro season in Triple-A after signing for $2,128,500, returned at the end of last year to pitch 11 innings between Rookie ball and the Arizona Fall League.  Before Burdi got hurt, he averaged 12.9 strikeouts per nine innings thanks to a fastball that sat at 95-100 mph and peaked at 102 with some armside run and a low-90s slider with impressive depth. Chicago had him control his intensity during his initial return, when his heater parked at 92-96 mph and his slider operated in the mid-80s.

CC for his sophomore season, then went 30 rounds higher to the same club the following June. Rivera took a similar path, turning down the Giants as a 32nd-rounder in 2017 to return to the Lions and then becoming the second-highest pick in the program's history when San Francisco redrafted him in the fourth round last June. Signed for a well over-slot $800,000 in the fourth round, he was tired and didn't have his best stuff in his pro debut.  When he's fully rested, Rivera has a legitimate out pitch in a low-80s curveball with sharp break. He's also capable of reaching 96 mph with his fastball, though he's most effective when he operates in the low 90s with sink. He began using his changeup more as a sophomore, showing the potential to become a solid third pitch.   Rivera has a smoother delivery when he paces himself as a starter but features more effort and some head whack when he reaches back for maximum velocity. He has the upside of a mid-rotation starter if he can get more consistent with his control and changeup. Some scouts who saw him as an amateur liked him more as a late-inning reliever who could focus on his curve and fastball, with one even comparing him to Kimbrel.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SFG\"","\"A\"","20","\"2018 Draft Rnd 4 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.4\"","\"50.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.3333","0.3333","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2600","2800","40","55","40","55","","55","","45","55","45","60","","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","60","","","","","45","","",""],["471","468","520","1088","106","\"45.2\"","\"44.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"52.9\"","\"52.9\"","\"52.9\"","\"|\"","\"Bobby\"","\"Poyner\"","2019","\"26.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2303","596074","","17987","\"sa827470\"","\"|\"","","\"Florida\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","40","","","\"Oddly, because four-pitch lefties with command typically find their way into a rotation, Poyner ran the pro ball gamut exclusively as a reliever and has a long track record of performance in that role.

He spent five separate stints with the eventual World Series champions, logging a 3.22 ERA and a 24/3 K/BB in 22 1/3 innings.  Poyner's fastball is tough to grade on the 20-80 scouting scale because it has 40 velocity (ranging from 88-92 mph) with 70 command and 80 deception. Even if it doesn't excite radar guns, his heater plays as a plus pitch, as does his fading changeup. He'll dabble with both a curveball and cutter just to give hitters different looks but both are fringy, and he relies heavily on his main two pitches.  Poyner isn't a lefty specialist because he doesn't have a quality breaking ball and actually has been slightly more effective against righties as a pro.

With a Vanderbilt commitment in his back pocket and his name trending in the right direction on Draft boards, it's looking like the move has paid off.  At 6-foot-6, Williams is the quintessential projectable high school right-hander. While he started the spring a bit slowly velocity-wise, at 87-91 mph, it's been ticking up, sitting 91-92 mph and regularly touching 94 mph, as he did throughout his NHSI shutout in March. It plays up because of its steep plane and angle and there should be more consistent velocity to come as he matures. He's been throwing both a slider and curve this spring, with success, with some scouts thinking the curve will ultimately work better coming from his high three-quarter slot. He has some feel for a future average changeup, though he doesn't have to throw it much in high school.  Despite his size, Williams tends to throw strikes and should have solid command and control, not to mention sharper stuff, once he figures out how to consistently repeat his delivery with his long levers.

Holloway has the makings of a top-of-the-rotation talent, beginning with a fastball that ranges from 95-99 mph. Though his curveball needs more consistency, it can be an absolute hammer at times. His changeup is more of a work in progress but shows solid potential.  While his upside is apparent, Holloway needs to establish health and consistency.

He uses four-seamers up in the strike zone and two-seamers down at the bottom, with his extension creating deception that stands out more than the life on his heater.

He pitched at three different levels during his debut season, but Hernandez's breakout came in '18 when he posted a 1.81 ERA for Class A Fort Wayne - which would've led the Midwest League with a few more innings to qualify.    Hernandez fits the mold of a crafty-and-deceptive Cuban southpaw, even if he doesn't boast big time velocity. His fastball sits in the low 90s but can reach 95-96. He's got a putaway curveball, and he pairs it with a serviceable slider and changeup.   What stands out most about Hernandez is his savvy on the mound. He constantly changes speeds and varies his delivery, and he routinely induces weak contact from opposing hitters. Hernandez is athletic, and he boasts an easy, smooth delivery.

True to projections, Yerzy's bat is coming along quickly. He built upon a strong Pioneer League campaign in 2017 by showing the same hitting ability and power potential last year at Class A Short Season Hillsboro, earning both mid- and post-season All-Star honors. Yerzy's defense is well behind his bat as expected, though he was noticeably better in 2018.   After struggling during his pro debut in 2016, Yerzy showed the ability to make adjustments, see pitches and start tapping into his plus raw power. Getting better use of his lower-half and hands has helped unlock more of his bat speed and natural hitting ability, leading to lots of hard contact to all fields. Club officials rave about Yerzy's confident and selective approach, noting that it gives him an excellent foundation for developing at the plate. Defensively, Yerzy has solid arm strength, and has thrown out just over 30 percent of potential basestealers in his young career heading into 2019. He made strides in his receiving and blocking in '18, slashing his number of passed balls to seven after recording 13 in '17 and 20 in his pro debut.   The D-backs have been pleased with Yerzy's progress behind the plate and will continue to deploy him there in 2019. If it all clicks, he could develop into the big league regular catcher, albeit a bat-first one. If not, Yerzy has the type of offensive ceiling needed to profile as a first baseman, where he started eight games in 2018.

High since Mike Trout in 2009. Kennedy signed for $500,000, forgoing his commitment to North Carolina, then showcased innate feel for squaring up the baseball during his pro debut. That continued for him in 2018 with a move up to the Pioneer League, where Kennedy produced a .327/.396/.465 line and garnered honors as a mid-season All-Star.   Kennedy may be stocky and lacking in physical projection, but there is plenty to like about his offensive profile. His quick bat and excellent control of the barrel enable him to make consistent line-drive contact from the right side, where he covers the plate well and shows a discerning eye. Those qualities should help him succeed at higher levels and, in general, give him the upside of an above-average hitter who's capable of hitting 15-plus homers and reaching base at a high clip.   A better athlete than his stout frame suggests, Kennedy is an average runner with good instincts on both sides of the ball.

As was the case with Rafael Devers in 2013, there were scouts who believed Diaz had the best combination of hitting ability and power in his international class. His pop was more evident in his 2018 pro debut, when he slugged six homers in 26 games in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League before breaking the hamate bone in his left hand.  Diaz has exciting bat speed and plenty of strength -- he's much bigger than his listed 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds after growing and adding considerable weight in his first year as a pro -- and has some of the best raw power in the system. He's still learning that home runs will come naturally, however. He got overly aggressive in his debut, losing control of the strike zone and getting too uphill with his right-handed swing at times.  A shortstop with average speed as an amateur, Diaz instantly moved to third base in pro ball and has slowed down as he has gotten bigger. There are mixed reports about his defense at the hot corner and his ability to stay there, but he definitely has the required arm strength and his work ethic should help.

He did improve over the course of the summer and pitched well in the playoffs to help Ogden win the Rookie-level Pioneer League championship. His 2018 season unfolded in a similar fashion, as he struggled after an August promotion to high Class A but won a crucial postseason game with 5 2/3 scoreless innings to contribute to Rancho Cucamonga capturing the California League title.  Uceta's best pitch is a hard changeup with fade and late tumble, and he throws it with the same arm speed as his fastball. His four-seam heater parks at 90-93 mph and reaches 95 with riding life up in the strike zone. He improved the shape of his curveball last year, giving him an average third offering.  Uceta has thrown strikes throughout his pro career, and his command improved once the Dodgers got him to stop throwing across his body and take a more direct path to the plate. A dogged competitor, he must be precise with his pitches and confuse hitters by throwing them from the same release point because he doesn't have overpowering stuff or deceptive angle.

His father Jim, also a right-hander, went in the second round of the 1991 Draft to the Astros before topping out in Triple-A, and Jimmy could go in the same range. He also offers intriguing hitting ability and some power potential, but teams are scouting him exclusively as a pitcher.    Lewis still has plenty of room to add strength to his 6-foot-6 frame and he already can reach 95 mph with his fastball and carry low-90s velocity deep into games. He uses his size and a high-three-quarters arm slot to deliver his pitches on a steep downhill plane. Those attributes also help him stay on top of an upper-70s curveball with good depth than can become a plus pitch once it's more consistent.    Lewis also demonstrates some feel for a changeup but will have to use it more often against more advanced hitters. He has a fairly simple delivery for such a tall pitcher, and his strength and athleticism bode well for his control and durability.

As the draft neared and he entered pro ball, Moniak added strength and lost a step (though he can still be an average center fielder) but struggled to make offensive adjustments. In the second half of 2018, Moniak turned the corner and stopped rolling over on pitches away; he also chose better pitches he could drive. He was also very young for the Hi-A Florida State League, which is notoriously pitcher friendly. In 2019, Moniak will start the season as a 20-year-old in Double-A Reading, which is notoriously hitter-friendly, and sources indicate he's bulked up since the season ended. This, in combination with a more progressive, loft-oriented hitting coordinator, could make now a buy-low opportunity on Moniak, even if his numbers will be artificially inflated at Reading. There's still a chance for a solid regular here, with fringe-to-average offense and defense in center field, and his age vs. level masks his ability a bit, but we'd like to see what changes are made in 2019 before totally buying in.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","\"2016, 1st (1) - PHI\"","","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Reports of Moniak's demise might be a bit exaggerated. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 Draft had trouble finding consistent footing during his first season and change as a pro, with concerns about his overall strength to impact the baseball mounting, leading many to feel he was headed toward the list of top picks who didn't pan out. Some adjustments in the second half of his 2018 season in the Florida State League, however, might have the outfielder headed in the right direction.  The one thing plaguing Moniak early in his career was his tendency for weak contact on the ground, leading some to worry that he wasn't strong enough to drive the ball. In the second half of 2018, however, he started to turn on the ball and drive it to his pull side more frequently and coupled that with better pitch decisions. There's still work to be done there, but he's reportedly already added more strength this offseason to help him show more extra-base thump. He was more consistent defensively as well and showed he could help a team in center field even when he wasn't swing the bat as well.  While there's no doubt Moniak needs to prove he can perform over the course of a full season, it's possible there's an up arrow next to his name while others have written him off.

He blew out his elbow that summer and had Tommy John surgery, sidelining him for all of 2017. He has been a totally different pitcher since he returned and could sneak into the first round this June after turning down the D-backs as a 26th-rounder last year as a redshirt sophomore. The Southeastern Conference pitcher of the year, he entered the NCAA tournament ranked second in strikeouts (150), hit rate (4.8 per nine innings) and WHIP (0.80).    While many pitchers see their velocity increase after they complete the grueling rehab process after having their elbow reconstructed, Small doesn't throw as hard as he did in the past but is much more effective. His fastball ranges from 86-92 mph yet generates a lot of swings and misses and weak contact. He creates plane with his 6-foot-3 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot and deception with some crossfire and by varying the tempo of his delivery.    Small also demonstrates significantly better feel for his changeup than he had before he got hurt, selling it with fastball arm speed and getting some fade on the mid-70s offering. He has a curveball with similar velocity and good depth, though he rarely uses it in games because he hasn't needed to. His control and command also are much improved since his Tommy John surgery, giving him a high floor and a chance to be a No. 4 starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","","9","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","58","28","\"MIL\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"RS Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"53.3\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","0.0000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","50","50","40","","","","55","55","55","45","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","50","","","","","50","","",""],["485","482","908","749","1056","\"45.1\"","\"42.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"45.5\"","\"36.1\"","\"46.3\"","\"|\"","\"Alejandro\"","\"Kirk\"","2019","\"20.6\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"69\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2784","672386","","","\"sa3005337\"","\"|\"","","\"Mexico\"","1","1","","\"High\"","2022","40","","","\"The first thing anyone talks about when Kirk's name comes up is his weight.

Fully healthy in 2018, Kirk established himself as a legitimate prospect by hitting .354/.443/.558 with 10 home runs and 57 RBIs over 58 games in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.   Kirk ranked among the Appy League leaders in a host of categories, as he finished third in average, fourth in OBP (.443) and slugging (.558) and tied for first in RBIs. Employing a direct and impactful swing, Kirk has natural hitting ability and above-average raw power to his pull side. He got to it during games consistently in 2018, though he's expected to be more of a hit-over-power guy as he moves through the Minors.

Listed at 5-foot-9, 220 pounds, Kirk isn't particularly athletic, nor does he run well. He's a good blocker, though, and earns praise for his solid arm strength and catch-and-throw skills that helped him throw out 43 percent of attempted basestealers in 2018.

A narrow, smallish frame and Guzman's tendency to baby his offspeed stuff into the zone are present issues, but the latter of these should be remedied with time and experience. Guzman has a bad breaking ball, and while breaking ball quality typically isn't something that improves very much over time, Guzman is so new to pitching that he may not yet have the right feel/grip on his breaker. The spin rate on his low-80s slider is beneath that of his fastball. Typically the inverse is true, and it's a sign that there's probably a grip issue, something that can be remedied.

There was some suggestion by scouts that Ferrell wasn't the type of pitcher who excels with all of the data and information that Houston offered; Miami's approach with him will reflect that.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2015, 3rd (79) - HOU\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Ferrell was on the fast track to reach the Majors after signing with the Astros for an above-slot $1 million in the third round in 2015, but his timetable got altered when he needed surgery to remove an aneurysm from his throwing shoulder the following May. He spent the second half of 2018 in Triple-A, but his inability to throw strikes led Houston to gamble by not protecting him on its 40-man roster. The Marlins claimed him in the big league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in December.  Ferrell has a two-pitch power mix that should play in the late innings and makes him a candidate to someday be a closer. His fastball ranges from 93-98 mph with some late hop and his mid-80s slider flashes two-plane break. Both can be well-above-average offerings at their best.  Because Ferrell pitches at a high tempo and has a tendency to overthrow, command and control have been issues for him dating back to his college days at Texas Christian. He did a better job of finding the strike zone when he returned from surgery, but his walk rate jumped from 2.3 per nine innings in 2017 to 5.9 last season. Rule 5 guidelines maintain that he stay on Miami's big league roster throughout 2019, or else he has to be exposed to waivers and then offered back to the Astros for half his $100,000 draft price.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"A+\"","30","\"2015 Draft Rnd 3 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","19","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.0\"","\"51.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2500","40","55","","","55","","","45","60","","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","","","60","","","","45","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["490","487","529","752","294","\"45.1\"","\"44.4\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.7\"","\"45.8\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"TJ\"","\"Friedl\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"70\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1886","670770","","","\"sa943754\"","\"|\"","","\"Nevada\"","1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"J6yThXQmC5o\"","","\"It's still unclear to us whether or not anyone knew Friedl was draft-eligible as sophomore in 2016. At the very least, he was overlooked playing on a weaker team in a lightly-scouted conference. He went undrafted, which allowed him to play for College Team USA, who only found out about him from a fortuitous tip, later in the summer. Friedl was the sparkplug on the heavily-scouted team that included multiple future first round picks, and a bidding war for him amongst teams that hadn't yet spent their entire 2016 draft pool ensued toward the end of Team USA's run. Friedl is a plus-plus runner with good baseball instrincts and a contact-first approach at the plate. He has sneaky raw power that he may tap into with swing adjustments. Somewhat similar to Stuart Fairchild, both have outcomes that range from upper-level 40-man occupant to low-end regular, but Friedl's bat is more stable and he's left-handed, so we have him ahead. He's almost a lock to hang around the big leagues for at least a few years in some role, even if it's as a fifth outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","\"CIN\"","","\"Aug. 4, 2016 - CIN\"","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  Friedl's start to professional baseball was indeed irregular. He hit over .400 at Nevada-Reno as a Draft-eligible sophomore in 2016, but he went undrafted because teams didn't realize he was eligible until after the Draft. A bidding war took place as he was playing for the U.S. National Collegiate Team, and the Reds were able to give him $735,000 to sign as a free agent. He played his way up to Double-A in his second full season of pro ball in 2018.  Friedl needs to figure out how to maximize his offensive value and do the little things -- such as bunting, slashing hits on the ground, the hit-and-run and moving runners -- enhancing his chances to reach his floor as a really good fourth outfielder. But with his speed, personality and ability to provide maximum effort, he could work himself into becoming an everyday center fielder. He doesn't strike out much and draws a decent amount of walks. While he's never going to be a huge home run guy, he does have a little sneaky pop and might run into a few homers.  One issue for Friedl currently is personnel related: There are other center field prospects ahead of him, namely Taylor Trammell and Jose Siri. Friedl has seen time in all three outfield spots, so he will be ready to fill that backup role if needed.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CIN\"","\"AA\"","13","\"2016 UDFA (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.5\"","\"52.7\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","30","45","70","50","45","55","40","50","70","55","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","60","45","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["491","488","530","481","528","\"45.1\"","\"44.4\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.2\"","\"37.3\"","\"50.3\"","\"|\"","\"Trent\"","\"Deveaux\"","2019","\"19.1\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","1935","677575","","","\"sa3006885\"","\"|\"","","\"Bahamas\"","2","-1","","\"High\"","2023","42","\"9bBhjY3rDxk\"","","\"After an exciting showing during minor league spring training, Deveaux struggled throughout the summer as he made swing change after swing change after swing change. It makes much more sense to tinker and find the right swing sooner rather than later, but Deveaux hit just .199 as he was asked to bring his side work onto the field during the summer. He had no fewer than four different cuts during 2018, and at times seemed so out of whack that pro scouts in Arizona began to actively steer clear of Tempe Diablo to avoid falling out of love with a player they were so enamored with during the spring. That player took your breath away when he'd hit his stride going from first to third, looked like he might be a black hole defender in center field because of his range, and was going to have power once the swing was refined.   If evaluating purely on physical ability, Deveaux belongs up near Jordyn Adams and Jeremiah Jackson in this system, but his 2018 was a bit of a red flag and he's probably going to be a long-term developmental project.  \"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - LAA\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 80 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Bahamanian baseball is starting to make an impact on professional baseball in the States, with the D-backs' Jazz Chisholm currently on the Top 100 Prospects list and Lucius Fox reaching the upper levels of the Rays' system. The Angels scouted the island well prior to the start of the 2017-18 signing period, getting a pair of premium athletes in D'Shawn Knowles and Deveaux, who got $1.2 million to sign. His professional, and United States, debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League showed that it's going to take time for Deveaux's athleticism to translate into performance on the field.  Though he struggled out of the gate, Deveaux continues to be one of the best athletes in the organization. He has top of the scale speed, which should allow him to steal bases and cover a ton of ground as an above-average, if not eventually plus, center fielder. He's starting to add strength, which will help him impact the ball more after more than half of his balls in play last summer were on the ground. While his strikeout rate of over 35 percent seems alarming, he has shown signs of making good decisions at the plate. Most of the work he needs to do is mechanical. He's still understanding his swing and learning to have a consistent bat path.  Deveaux has pleased the organization with his willingness to ask questions and learn with an understanding he has a long way to go.

A fist fight with a teammate ended a college career marred by various other infractions and inconsistent physical conditioning. Romero's stuff was really good -- he'd bump 96 and flash two plus secondaries -- and he probably would have gone early in the first round of the 2017 draft had he not been a makeup powder keg, but he fell to pick 25, where Washington decided his talent was worth the gamble. Romero was sent home during his first pro spring training for repeated curfew violations. He came back in July and made six starts, then was shut down. He was back up in mid-August for a single start, then was shut down again and needed Tommy John, which he had at the end of August. The timing of the injury means Romero may not pitch until 2020, when he'll be 24. There's a chance he pitches in Arizona next fall or perhaps in the Aussie League, but if not, he'll just be a 40 on our lists until we see that the stuff is back.\"","\"|\"","","\"WAS\"","\"2017, 1st (25) - WSH\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  A closer at the outset of his college career, Romero quickly pitched his way into Houston's starting rotation as a freshman before emerging in earnest as the staff ace the following year. Pegged as a likely top 10 Draft pick after a strong start to his junior campaign, Romero was suspended for four starts in April for repeated violations of university and athletic department policy, returned in May for three relief appearances and got kicked off the team permanently. The Nationals still took Romero with the No. 25 overall pick that June, and he signed for $2.8 million. Concern over Romero's off-the-field issues cropped up once again in early 2018, when he was sent home from Minor League camp after violating a team policy. It delayed the start of his season until June, and Romero's elbow bothered him once he returned, leading to Tommy John surgery in late August.   A physically strong left-hander, Romero pitched with front-of-the-rotation stuff in the past when he wasn't in trouble or hurt. He has feel for locating a 92-95 mph fastball that he pairs with a plus, swing-and-miss slider in the low 80s that nets him strikeouts on both sides of the plate. Romero's changeup, meanwhile, has the makings of becoming an above-average third offering. Romero will miss bats with all three pitches when he's on, all while showing average control and command.  That Romero has a thicker build and considerable effort in his delivery gives some evaluators pause in projecting him as a starter long term. The Nationals think Romero has the necessary components to start, and he'll be given every opportunity to develop in that role, though that plan could change depending on his recovery and eventual return to the mound in 2020.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"A\"","9","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"54.2\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2300","40","60","45","","55","","","50","60","55","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","","60","","","","50","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["493","490","429","482","373","\"45.1\"","\"45.1\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.1\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Bryce\"","\"Osmond\"","2019","\"18.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"175\"","\"draft\"","165","4","\"|\"","2856","","\"osmond_bryce\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Jenks HS\"","0","0","","","","40","","\"Osmond was a solid projection arm from this summer that flashed above average stuff and this spring the stuff has been the same to better while the starter traits have also progressed.\"","","\"|\"","\"Jenks (Okla.)

But he's also the best pitching prospect to come out of Jenks (Okla.) High since Josh Johnson was a Marlins fourth-rounder in 2002, and whichever team drafts him will keep him on the mound. He could go a couple of rounds higher than Johnson did to a club willing to bet on his athleticism and projectability.     Osmond has one of the quickest arms in the 2019 prep class, making it easy to dream on his fastball. He works at 92-94 mph early in games and sits more at 88-91 in the later innings for now, but he could have a mid-90s heater once he adds strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. Operating from a high-three-quarters arm slot, he creates more downhill plane than life on his fastball.    Osmond's arm angle gives him depth on a low-80s slider that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch when he doesn't open too early in his delivery. The Oklahoma State recruit has demonstrated feel for a changeup in the bullpen but hasn't had much cause to use it in games.

Thompson announced his presence by reaching 95 mph as a rising junior at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in 2017 and remains one of the hardest throwers in this year's prep class, though he has lacked consistency this spring.  Thompson has an ultra-quick arm and an athletic delivery that produces low-90s fastballs with a maximum velocity of 96 mph when he's at his best, though he also has worked at 89-90 at times this year. His fastball doesn't feature a lot of life but he gets good plane on it with his high three-quarters arm slot. His curveball can give him a second plus pitch at times, though it hasn't been reliable this spring as it had been in the past and flattens into more of a slider when he doesn't stay on top of it.

After getting off to a shaky start at Class A Short Season Hillsboro in 2018, Tabor finished with a 1.74 ERA over his final 33 frames.   Tabor has impressed with his stuff, pitchability and polish, the latter being particularly impressive given his cold-weather background. Working from an athletic and repeatable delivery, he'll touch 94-95 mph and sit in the low 90s with his fastball, and there's reason to believe there's more in the tank as he fills out his projectable frame.

Tabor understands how to change eye levels and keep hitters off-balance using his fastball-changeup pairing.

In his first full pro season, he was leading the low Class A South Atlantic League in hitting (.346) and on-base percentage (.395) when he got promoted in late June.  Rivera has one of the best right-handed swings in the White Sox system, possesses nice feel for the barrel and makes consistent contact. Though his stroke is geared more for line drives, he has solid bat speed and enough strength for some pull-side power. He's so aggressive and puts the bat on the ball so easily that he rarely walks, so there's some concern that more advanced pitchers will exploit his impatience.  A decent athlete, Rivera has a high baseball IQ that helps him get the most out of his tools. He's an average runner who will steal or take an extra base when the opportunity presents itself.

While he finished second in the organization in strikeouts and capped off his year with a good start up a level in the Florida State League playoffs, the left-hander gave up more hits (168) than innings pitched (154) in the Midwest League.    Naughton can be prone to creating his own big innings with one mistake. He often fought his delivery, causing his stuff to not be as sharp. That was particularly true of his breaking ball, which can get caught between a curve and a slider. He needs to rely on movement, deception and command because of his lack of plus stuff, starting with an 87-94 mph fastball that can sneak up on hitters due to his deception, but often lacks movement. He might need to pick one breaking ball to help define it better and give him a third solid pitch, behind his above-average changeup. He goes right after hitters and fills up the strike zone (2.0 BB/9 in 2018).    Naughton finished off his first full season much more strongly than he started it.

After two-plus summers playing in the Dominican Summer League, the outfielder made a solid United States debut in the rookie-level Pioneer League in 2018.  Montano has always had tools and he's starting to grow into them. One of the biggest steps forward has been his ability to add man strength, with emotional maturity to match. He's an advanced hitter with an excellent left-handed swing, one who is getting more patient and using all fields better earch year. He stuck to his gameplan well in 2018, handling offspeed stuff more consistently well and using the middle of the field better. As he continues to get stronger, the Rockies think he could have average power. He played a solid center field in Grand Junction a year ago and has a chance to stay there, though he's also seen time in right, with an arm that now plays average.

While Garcia and Antuna have already emerged as the gems of that group and both spent 2018 in full-season ball, Sanchez spent the year in the New York-Penn League, showing a slick glove at shortstop but making little impact at the plate.   Sanchez has a compact right-handed swing and present feel for going the other way, though he currently lacks the physical strength needed to leverage and drive the baseball. He does have room left to grow into his athletic frame, and the hope is that he'll begin to impact the ball a bit more consistently as he fills out. He also shows good instincts on the bases, though his speed is only average.  With plus defense as his calling card, Sanchez might not need to be a great hitter in order to reach the Major Leagues.

Wilson has solid raw power and speed but has yet to translate them into significant home run or stolen base totals. After making strides with his approach in 2017, he regressed last year, striking out at a career-high 28 percent rate and struggling mightily against right-handers (.209/.296/.319).

After working in the low 90s as a college starter, Carroll now deals at 96-98 mph and touches higher with his fastball. Hitters can't sit on his heater because he also can make it look bad with a mid-80s breaking ball that combines slider velocity and curveball depth. He also mixes in a mid-80s splitter against left-handers on occasion.  Though there's not much effort in his delivery, Carroll didn't provide a lot of strikes in college and hasn't in pro ball. That was especially true in the Majors, where he issued 13 free passes and allowed six home runs in 17 innings. He sometimes overthrows and yanks his pitches out of the zone.

He'll need to temper his aggressive approach in order to hit for average, and he has yet to prove he can handle left-handers well enough to be more than a platoon player. He knows how to use his plus speed to steal and take extra bases.  Johnson runs well enough to play center field but has spent the majority of his career in right. That's in large part because he has plus-plus arm strength that helped him rack up 11 assists in just 92 games last year. If he can't hit consistently enough to make it as a regular, his tools would make him a dynamic fourth outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CLE\"","\"AAA\"","21","\"2016 Draft Rnd 5 (WAS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"51.8\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","35","55","70","40","80","50","45","55","70","50","80","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","60","70","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TEX\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["510","507","556","477","653","\"45.0\"","\"44.2\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.5\"","\"37.9\"","\"49.5\"","\"|\"","\"Miguel\"","\"Hiraldo\"","2019","\"18.7\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","1955","677599","","","\"sa3005486\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2022","40","\"lIpzLYf2EHg\"","","\"Dominican Summer League stats are largely meaningless, but every year there is a prospect or two whose statline is so utterly dominant that it provokes immediate re-evaluation. Hiraldo, who was hitting .366/.429/.560 when July began, was one of those DSL hitters in 2018. When prompted about Hiraldo, pro scouts with coverage in the DSL reiterated what was said about him when he was an amateur. He was physically mature for his age, stocky, and strong, far more muscular than most of his DSL peers. He has plus bat speed, average power right now, and tracks pitches well and has some barrel control, so while Hirlado's physical maturity should cause one to discount his statistical performance, he is a good offensive prospect.   There's not much room left on his frame for good weight, and he has fairly limited power projection left. Scouts already anticipate a move off of shortstop to either second or third base. Hiraldo's offensive talent could be sufficient to profile every day at either spot, just probably not as a star and probably not for several years considering the passive developmental track the Jays took with him last year when he probably should have been in the GCL for more than a 10-game August jaunt.\"","\"|\"","","\"TOR\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - TOR\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 45 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 50  MLB Pipeline's No. 17 prospect for the 2017-18 international period, Hiraldo earned rave reviews for his bat as an amateur in the Dominican Republic -- so much so that some scouts viewed him as the best overall hitter in his class. The Blue Jays signed Hiraldo in July, securing his future with a $750,000 bonus. He lived up to this reputation in his professional debut, finishing in the United States with a taste of the Gulf Coast League after he had raked in Dominican Summer League.   Hiraldo's impressive pro debut underscored his potential at the plate. Strong beyond his years, he has plus bat speed and impacts the ball using a quick, compact swing in which he generates huge extension through contact, driving the ball with back-spin carry. He has innate feel for finding the barrel, too, though his approach can be too pull-oriented, and he'll struggle with spin at times. The consistent gap power he showed in 2018, on top of his aforementioned swing mechanics, gives scouts the impression that Hiraldo could be good for 20-plus homers annually in his prime.   Questions pertaining to Hiraldo's ability to stick at shortstop long-term will continue to follow him as he moves through the Minors, but he handled the position well during in pro debut, albeit while relying on his sheer athleticism and above-average arm strength. But as a physically advanced teenager with below-average speed and only modest defensive actions, Hiraldo likely will end up at the hot corner. The good news is that his bat could profile nicely there, provided Hiraldo's development plays out as expected and he makes the necessary adjustments along the way.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"R\"","19","\"2017 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"34.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","30","45","50","40","55","55","50","50","40","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","45","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["511","508","513","478","722","\"45.0\"","\"44.6\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.1\"","\"45.6\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Castellani\"","2019","\"23.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"223\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","892","624418","\"castellani_ryan\"","","\"sa828689\"","\"|\"","","\"Brophy Prep (AZ)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","42","","","\"At times Castellani looks like a mid-rotation starter, and at others he's too wild to be effective.

Castellani still has the kind of stuff to fit well in a big league rotation. He'll throw his fastball up to 97 mph with good life to it and backs it up with an above-average low-80s slider. His changeup is behind the other two, but he has more than enough feel for it to be a third Major League average offering. He's proven to be an innings-eater, with his 134 1/3 IP in 2018 by far his low-water mark the last three seasons. Last year, he saw his walk rate spike and his strike out rate plummet and it's mostly because he got out of whack with his delivery. Castellani got out of his natural, three-quarters slot and climbed higher and higher, sapping the right-hander of velocity and control.  Castellani started to re-find that arm slot in the Arizona Fall League, where he threw well down the stretch, especially in three of his final four outings.

He flashed first-round stuff at times in 2018 and won the game that thrust Arkansas into the College World Series final, but he lasted until the 24th round (Angels) as a redshirt sophomore because of questions about his health, inconsistency and signability. After doing a nice job of easing those concerns in 2019, he should be one of the first college right-handers drafted in June.    Like he did a year ago, Campbell is operating at 91-95 mph with his fastball, which has reached 98 and plays up thanks to the steep downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters delivery. The biggest difference from 2018 is that he now can land his secondary pitches for strikes on a regular basis, so hitters can't just sit on his heater if he falls behind in the count. His second-best weapon is a low-80s slider that sometimes morphs into a mid-80s cutter.    Campbell has scrapped a changeup he didn't trust for a mid-80s splitter that shows flashes of giving him a third solid offering. He also has an upper-70s curveball that he can get over for strikes to give batters a different look. He has a sound delivery and the ceiling of a No. 3 starter if he can maintain the improvements he has made this spring.

He remained on the board until the fifth round, where he was selected by the Nationals, and then rewarded the organization by reaching full-season ball during his pro debut after signing for slot value.  Canning employs a line-drive approach and shows extra-base ability from the left side of the plate, albeit with below-average over-the-fence power and swing-and-miss tendencies that he'll need to tone down. He has plus speed, but has not been an efficient basestealer. After playing corner outfield spots his first two seasons, he made the move to center field as a junior and then saw time at all three spots (center and right field, primarily) during his pro debut.  Canning gets respect from scouts as being a \"baseball player,\" one who plays with high energy and can do the little things to help a team.

He finished the season in the Major Leagues, collecting three hits in 11 at-bats, and was named the club's Bob Boone Award winner after the season on the merits of his leadership and professionalism. All of his progress came to a halt in 2018, however, as Read received a season-opening 80-game suspension after a positive offseason test for the steroid Boldenone, and he struggled at the plate between Double-A and Triple-A upon returning.   Read has a mature approach and natural hitting ability, with a short right-handed swing that produces contact to all fields as well as above-average raw power. However, the game power Read showed in 2017 wasn't there last year, prompting some to speculate that his power potential may have been inflated by the performance-enhancing drug. But scouts still generally view him as a decent hitter who makes a lot of contact and understands the strike zone.   Behind the plate, Read's above-average arm strength and solid catch-and-throw skills have helped him throw out 36.7 percent of attempted basestealers in his career through 2018.

The strength and leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame and his all-out right-handed swing give him well above-average raw power to all fields and produce the highest exit velocity of any Rangers prospect since Joey Gallo. His ultra-aggressive approach yielded a 140/23 K/BB ratio and 31 percent strikeout rate last year, however, and may not work against more advanced pitching.

Three years later scouts still aren't sure where he fits best, but he's a switch-hitter who has hit for power in the Southeastern Conference and draws some \"poor man's Kyle Schwarber\" comparisons.    Dillard generates impressive raw pop with a combination of bat speed, strength and loft in his swing. He has improved his plate discipline and contact rate throughout his college career and has a chance to hit for average as well. Though he has below-average speed, he's aggressive on the bases and has good feel for picking spots to steal.    Dillard has played mostly left field at Mississippi, showing at least average arm strength but limited range. The hope is that he can become an adequate defender in left, but he could wind up at first base or DH.

A return to Midland for a full season in the Texas League wasn't quite as productive, but it did net him an All-Star nod.  Ramirez is the kind of player whose whole is better than the sum of his parts. He's a professional hitter with an understanding of the strike zone from the left side of the plate. He'll draw walks and flash some power, but he's more about spraying the ball around the field and getting on base, with the chance to be an above-average hitter if he can cut down his strikeout rate a bit more. Ramirez won't wow you in the outfield, but he's a very good defender in all three spots and can even hold down center despite not being that fleet afoot.

His stuff, while very good, isn't overpowering, however, as he'll sit at 90-92 mph with his fastball, at times reaching back for more. His ability to locate his heater down in the zone gives it good life and helps to set up his short, low-80s breaking ball and a work-in-progress changeup, both showing average potential.   Irvin will never generate many strikeouts, but he is consistently around the zone with his three-pitch mix, thanks in part to a low-effort delivery that he repeats well and features some deception.

He spent just one summer with Seattle as he was sent to the Braves in January 2017, along with Luiz Gohara in return for Mallex Smith and Shae Simmons. He reached Double-A in 2018, his second season in the organization, then capped things off in the Arizona Fall League.  Burrows' calling card is his breaking ball, and it's a real weapon against left-handed hitters but nasty enough to miss right-handed bats as well. He throws it with deception with late, sharp break, and hitters don't see it. It's the main reason why he carries a 12.2 K/9 ratio into the 2019 season. His fastball sits in the low-90s coming from a low three-quarters slot, allowing it to play up beyond the velocity.  Burrows' progress has been slowed a bit by a lack of consistency and command, though it's clear his two-pitch mix is plenty to get big league hitters out. At the very least, he's a left-handed specialist.

He hit 35 home runs in 104 games for Daytona after the trade and his 36 total homers tied him for the Minor League lead.    While there is no question about Isabel's ability to hit the ball out of the park, there are many worries about him making enough contact to use that power in games as he moves up the ladder. In 2018, Isabel also struck out 152 times or 36 percent of his at-bats. He has below average running ability and is below average as a defender. He does have an average arm and could be occasionally utilized in right field, where he played eight games for Daytona.    Isabel could be a more athletic version of Chris Carter if he can refine his overall approach at the plate and harness his raw power.

When he hit .320 with an .877 OPS in his pro debut, reaching full-season ball, it looked like the Royals had a steal on their hands. He wasn't able to build off the very strong foundation of that pro debut in 2018 when he blew out his right ACL six games into the season.  Once again healthy, Gigliotti can get back to being the on-base machine who can wreak havoc on the basepaths. It remains to be seen if the injury will have any toll on his well above-average speed, but the Royals don't expect any regression and he was running without hesitation this spring. That should allow him to steal bases and continue to cover a ton of ground in center field, with great instincts, reads and routes as well. Gigliotti knows who he is as a hitter, sending line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate, working counts and getting on base, albeit without much power.

The Blue Jays took him in the 15th round in the 2017 Draft, signed him for $125,000 and watched Noda take home Rookie-level Appalachian League MVP honors after he led the league in average (.364), on-base percentage (.507) and slugging (.575). Making his full-season debut at Class A Lansing in 2018, Noda didn't hit for much average but still had a strong campaign, ranking among the Midwest League leaders with 20 home runs (third), a .905 OPS (second), a .421 OBP (first) and 109 walks (first).   Noda generates plus raw power from line to line, combining physical strength, bat speed and a leveraged swing from the left side of the plate. His power comes with quite a bit of swing-and-miss, though, and it's unlikely that Noda will be anything more than a below-average hitter. He does compensate for his lack of pure hitting ability with outstanding on-base skills, a product of an extremely patient approach that netted him a Minor League-leading 109 walks last season after he led the Appy League in that category in 2017.   Primarily a first baseman at Cincinnati, Noda received the bulk of his playing time there during his pro debut and then split time between first base and the outfield at Lansing. He's a capable defender on the dirt and a little better on the outfield corners.

He did make up for lost time by hitting well in the Venezuelan Winter League.  Daza has a knack for barreling up the baseball and picks up hits in bunches, and while he's perfectly happy to shoot line drives the other way, he did start turning on pitches and driving them to his pull side more effectively in 2018, though over-the-fence power is never going to be a big part of his game. He's not a burner, but he runs well enough to be an effective baserunner and uses his speed well in center field.

For our purposes, Astudillo forces us to consider how we define the hit tool without letting other skills bleed in, which leads us to all kinds of existential questions about traditional tool classifications. Eventually, your tools just are what your performance is, and Astudillo has accumulated about a month's worth of freakish data that's impossible to ignore. He has been, and this is true of his entire pro career, an elite K% (3%) and in-zone contact rate (96%) hitter, and were we to make a hierarchy of individual stats that indicate ability to hit, those would be at the top.   This thinking can be considered flawed. Jose Iglesias has had plus-plus contact rates throughout his career, but hits just .265 because he lacks strength. That's a lack of power bleeding in to how the hit tool plays, but in his case we'd say the hit tool is still good. You could argue that, similar to power, we should have Raw Hit and Game Hit split into two tools. In that vein, Astudillo is again exemplary in the way his tools/skills interact, as his game power plays beneath his raw, because he can't help himself but swing so damn much, and often the contact is sub-optimal. The Fat Ichiro moniker was bestowed upon Brett Wallace too soon; this is the genuine article.   Correctly dubbed 'positionless' as a young prospect, Astudillo has ended up a passable glove at several of the places minor league managers tried to hide him in his early 20s. Minnesota has played him all over the field -- catcher, first base, second base, third base, left field -- and he's okay everywhere. He had average catcher pop times in the big leagues last year. The 'role' to expect here is that of a versatile corner bench bat. It's just the strangest version of that, a husky super utility man, with maybe the best hand-eye coordination on the planet.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"AAA\"","11","\"2008 J2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"53.6\"","\"53.6\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","80","45","40","20","40","50","80","45","40","20","40","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIA\"","2.200","\"V\""],["526","523","231","387","49","\"45.0\"","\"47.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"54.1\"","\"46.7\"","\"54.8\"","\"|\"","\"Sam\"","\"Carlson\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1975","672277","\"carlson_sam\"","","\"sa3005015\"","\"|\"","","\"Burnsville HS (MN)\"","0","-2","","\"High\"","2022","42","\"PK5O-3F8YyM\"","","\"Carlson has thrown just three pro innings since signing, as the minor flexor strain that shelved him after his draft turned out to be a prelude to surgery. He was given a PRP injection in an attempt to avoid Tommy John, but it was unsuccessful and he was operated on in early July of 2018. The timing of the surgery may keep Carlson out for all of 2019. When he finally returns, he'll be a 21-year-old with less developmental polish than a lot of teenage prospects from year-round baseball areas like Florida and Texas, as a former two-way, cold-weather high schooler who will have missed about 30 consecutive months of reps.   The summer before his senior year, Carlson was 88-92 with better command and changeup feel than is typical for a northern prep arm. His velocity ticked up the following spring and he was touching 96, then sat 92-95 in his few pro innings before his injury.

Unfortunately, the Mariners haven't gotten to see him pitch competitively much, as he made just a few outings during his summer debut, then needed Tommy John surgery last July without throwing a pitch in a game.  Carlson was just finishing his rehab as pitchers and catchers were getting set to report to Spring Training and was playing catch out to 120 feet. The Mariners obviously won't rush the process, but they are eager to see how Carlson's stuff plays, especially because he's filled out his 6-foot-4 frame and is more man than kid now. During that senior year, Carlson's fastball sat in the 93-97 mph range and there's no reason to believe he can't get back to that, if not beyond that once he gets going, and he pairs it well with his fading changeup. His slider would flash plus before the injury, but it was inconsistent, so that will likely be an area of focus, and he always was able to fill up the strike zone with all three pitches.  If all goes well, Carlson will get some mound time at the end of the summer in the rookie-level Arizona League. The 2020 season will be the first time the Mariners will get to see exactly what kind of pitcher Carlson might become.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"A\"","13","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"55.8\"","\"51.7\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0007-02-18","2200","2350","40","55","50","45","","","","55","60","60","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","60","","55","","","","55","\"CHC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["527","524","881","1084","650","\"44.9\"","\"42.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"48.5\"","\"47.9\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","\"Jordan\"","\"Sheffield\"","2019","\"24.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1649","642068","\"sheffield_jordan\"","","\"sa738245\"","\"|\"","","\"Vanderbilt\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","40","\"MCB1O1uhU9E\"","\" \"","\"A biceps strain limited Sheffield to just 34 innings in Rancho Cucamonga and another nine in the Fall League, so he's back in Hi-A as a 23-year-old, and officially in the bullpen.

While he struggled to perform on paper, he has a pro-quality power and speed combination that enabled him to play center field in high school. He was drafted and will be developed as a two-way player, likely pitching once a week while playing in the outfield once or twice a week and DH'ing the rest of the time as a way to manage fatigue.

Depending on whom you ask, he's either a 70 or 80 runner, but his instincts on the bases and in the field aren't up to snuff just yet.

His low-80s slider has some bite at times but gets slurvy too often, and his changeup doesn't feature much action or deception.  Scouts don't like the wrist wrap in the back of Johnson's delivery, which affects his feel for his secondary pitches and his command, if not his ability to throw strikes.

While he still has gains to make with regards to his control, Diaz's stuff has steadily ticked up each year as he's added strength and logged experience. It all started to click for him in 2018, as Diaz pitched his way up to the Florida State League as part of a breakout campaign.   Diaz's athleticism and quick arm help him generate easy velocity. He sits in the mid-90s with a lively fastball that he pairs with an above-average breaking ball. He misses bats with both pitches, while the crossfire in Diaz's delivery gives him natural deception and makes him especially tough on right-handed hitters. His changeup remains a work in progress, though Diaz has made strides in developing in the past year to the point where it's at least usable against left-handed hitters. His control, though still below-average, was markedly better last season as he trimmed his walk rate to 3.2 BB/9 from 4.8 in 2017.   After wearing down physically early in his career, Diaz has worked hard to add strength and improve his durability. His efforts showed in 2018 in the form of 147 1/3 innings, nearly double his workload from the previous year. Diaz's all-around progress continues to give him life as a starter, though many scouts believe he's ticketed for the bullpen, where his fastball-curveball combo could play up in short bursts.

If he does develop an improved ability to locate, he could be one of the better left-handed relievers in baseball because he has such a dominant fastball. Not only does Pelham throw really hard, at times sitting 97-99, but his size, arm slot, and cross-bodied delivery create unique angle on his fastball, and hitters struggle to square it up. In a small big league sample last year, 77% of Pelham's pitches were fastballs, which would rank 13th among qualified relievers. His upper-80s cutter/slider doesn't have significant length to it, and it also needs improved location if it's going to miss bats. Once in a while, elite relievers with a single, tyrannical pitch emerge. It's possible Pelham is one of those, but it's more likely his issues limit him to single, middle-inning bullpen work.\"","\"|\"","","\"TEX\"","\"2015, 33rd (978) - TEX\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Cutter: 60 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Pelham didn't start pitching until he was a high school senior in 2013 and reached 95 mph with his fastball that spring, yet he went undrafted because he was so raw. Though he couldn't find the strike zone in two years at Spartanburg Methodist (S.C.) JC, the Rangers gave him $40,000 as a 33rd-rounder in 2015 because of his size and arm strength. His career took off once he moved to the bullpen full-time in 2017 and he soared from high Class A to the big leagues last year.  Pelham didn't have enough pitches or control to succeed as a starter, and simplifying things made a huge difference for him. Coming out of the bullpen, he focuses on two pitches, beginning with a mid-90s fastball that reaches 99 mph with unpredictable life. If hitters try to sit on his heater, he can make them look bad with a plus cutter that climbs into the low 90s.  Built and athletic like an NFL tight end, Pelham uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create steep downhill plane. He has cleaned up his delivery, which used to feature a lot of effort, but still has yet to prove he can deliver consistent strikes.

He was a candidate for a 2018 national breakout, but got hurt during spring training and missed the entire season while recovering from labrum surgery. The injury ate an important year of Whitley's development, and also created risk that he has to move to left field if his arm strength doesn't return (he began throwing a baseball again in late-August). Just as he was starting to answer a lot of the pre-draft questions, a bunch of new ones were introduced, but we're still enamored with Whitley's physical gifts and upside.

High. The rawness associated with such a distinction was obvious during his first two seasons, when Whitley appeared behind the talent curve at two lower levels before finishing 2016 on a high note. That success carried over into Whitley's full-season debut, when he made significant gains in all facets of the game as a member of Class A Bowling Green. He appeared poised for a breakout campaign in 2018, but instead suffered a torn right labrum during Spring Training which required surgery, effectively ending Whitley's season before it began.  Whitley's speed is his best tool, grading as a legitimate plus. He let his tools play in the Midwest League in 2017 and saw his bat and power blossom as a result en route to a career-high 13 home runs. What's more, Whitley was able to start tapping into his power without detracting from his patient approach and feel to hit. Whitley's on-base skills fuel his ability to impact games with his speed, and he had swiped 21 bags in back-to-back years before losing all of 2018 to injury.  Defensively, Whitley's athleticism and wheels give him a chance to remain in center field. He showed above-average arm strength before getting hurt, but it's yet to be seen just how much the injury has impacted his throwing ability, as he only resumed throwing in August.

Lakins works a lot with a low-90s cutter that has enough length to miss bats away from righties. After peppering his glove side with cutters, he can throw riding, mid-90s four seamers past hitters at the top of the strike zone, which then sets up his 12-6 curveball beneath it.

Lakins had four legitimate pitches as a starter but focuses on two as a reliever. His upper-80s cutter is his bread and butter, and he plays it off a 92-95 mph fastball that can hit 97 with some modest life. His downer curveball showed flashes of becoming a plus offering when he used it more in the past season, and his fading changeup had its moments as well.  Working in shorter stints, Lakins demonstrates better control and command than he did as a starter.

Webb's measurables don't properly capture his size; his broad shoulders mimic the shape and proportions of a generic minor league batter's eye. He has a mid-90s fastball and upper-70s curveball that pair well together, as the latter has sharp, vertical action and bat-missing depth. Webb continued to log innings as a starter up through Double-A, but he likely projects in relief. His changeup has improved and he was healthy throughout 2018, though his fastball control remains below-average.

High in 2014 with consecutive no-hitters then blew out his elbow in his third start and required Tommy John surgery. He spent 2015 rehabilitating his elbow and turned down the Indians as a 38th-round pick before enrolling at South Carolina. A rare Draft-eligible freshman, he led the Southeastern Conference with 128 strikeouts in 102 innings before going to the Brewers in the third round of the 2016 Draft. After Webb had a solid first full season in the Midwest League, his development accelerated in 2018 as the right-hander finished the year with a strong performance at Double-A Biloxi, striking out 10 batters and allowing one hit in his final regular-season start, then firing another six-inning, one-hit gem in the Southern League playoffs.   Webb's power stuff is headlined by a plus fastball-curveball combo. His heater currently sits in the mid-90s with riding life, and there's a chance he adds even more velocity as he continues to distance himself from the surgery. His curveball, meanwhile, is a 12-to-6 hammer that he throws with power in the mid- to upper-70s. Together, the two pitches give Webb the ability to induce ugly swings-and-misses, which he did at a near 15 percent clip in 2018, while averaging 9.5 strikeouts-per-nine. Webb's split-changeup gives him a third above-average-or-better pitch, one that at times can be almost as effective as his curveball.   While Webb's dynamic arsenal and room for improvement give him a chance to remain a starter, most scouts project him as a reliever long-term because he doesn't have an athletic delivery, doesn't consistently throw strikes and his command is even more sporadic. He does create deception with his mechanics and does a good job attacking hitters north and south, using an aggressive nature that could work well in a high-leverage bullpen role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"A+\"","25","\"2016 Draft Rnd 5 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"51.7\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0004-10-14","2250","2300","40","60","50","60","","","","45","60","55","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","60","","","","","40","","",""],["537","534","573","472","671","\"44.9\"","\"44.1\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.4\"","\"37.1\"","\"49.4\"","\"|\"","\"D'Shawn\"","\"Knowles\"","2019","\"18.4\"","\"CF\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2701","677610","","","\"sa3006889\"","\"|\"","","\"Bahamas\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","42","\"OQUHC-_sNFg\"","","\"Knowles was still just 16 when he came stateside for his first pro instructional league.

His footspeed enables projection in center field and while he's had early-career issues with strikeouts, he's not one to expand the zone and instead has the bat-control issues that are typical of early-career switch hitters.

At the start of the 2017-18 international signing period, they double-dipped in the Bahamas, signing a pair of outfielders: Trent Deveaux for $1.2 million and Knowles for $850,000. It's been Knowles who broke out of the gate during his pro debut in 2018, earning a promotion from the Arizona to the Pioneer League.    Throughout his first summer of pro ball, Knowles showed a solid approach from both sides of the plate, with excellent bat speed. There's emerging power, though it only showed up from the left side during his debut. He's not afraid to draw walks and could be a plus hitter as he continues to refine his approach, perhaps eventually with average big league pop.

He became the program's highest-drafted player since Tim Salmon in 1989, signing with the Giants for an over-slot $850,000 in the third round. In his abbreviated pro debut last summer, he did what he does best: miss bats and get groundouts.  Wong sits at 93-95 mph and reaches 97 mph with his fastball, which features heavy sink when he keeps it down in the strike zone. He switched from throwing a slider in 2017 to using a curveball in 2018, and its power and depth give it the makings of a potential plus offering. His changeup has some fading action but can get too firm at times.  With Wong's size, strength and sound delivery, he should have the durability to handle a starter's workload over a full pro season.

He's proven to be durable, yet inconsistent, though there's hope the big right-hander has turned a corner with a strong finish to his Double-A season and an outstanding showing in the Arizona Fall League, which helped him earn a spot on the 40-man roster.  With a solid three-pitch mix and excellent Trackman data, Blewett should have more success on his resume than he does. Some of that has to do with his pitch selection, as he relies too heavily on his fastball. The Royals think there might still be a tick more to come velocity-wise as he's shown the ability. He'll show 94- to 95-mph and maintains his velocity deeper into starts than he used to, but he doesn't sit there.

Sikkema will add to the latter list this June and is a safe bet to add to the former in a couple of years. He's a left-hander with three effective pitches and a history of success in a variety of roles, not to mention competitiveness and confidence that are off the charts.  Sikkema usually operates at 89-91 mph with run and sink on his fastball from a lower three-quarters arm angle, though he can raise his slot and reach back for 93-95 mph when needed. He has tremendous feel for manipulating the shape of his high-spin slider, which ranges from 78-83 mph and is a plus pitch at its best. He also has advanced feel for a sinking changeup that he'll throw in any count.  Sikkema's stocky frame and crossfire delivery aren't pretty but his stuff plays up because of the angle and extension he creates and his willingness to attack hitters. He not only throws strikes, but he'll also use any pitch in any count and work inside against left-handers and right-handers. He has one of the higher floors among college pitchers in this Draft, projecting as at least a lefty reliever at the Major League level, and his deception and conviction could carry him to a role at the back of a rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","","28","\"2019 Draft Rnd 1 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","78","38","\"NYY\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"50.0\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","0.2500","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","50","40","","50","","","50","50","45","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","55","","","","50","","",""],["541","538","454","385","788","\"44.9\"","\"45.0\"","\"44.3\"","\"47.6\"","\"39.8\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Chris\"","\"Seise\"","2019","\"20.4\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","1969","669451","\"seise_chris\"","","\"sa3004142\"","\"|\"","","\"West Orange HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","\"bB9NGkEjufw\"","","\"The Rangers backfields are full of big, projectable frames.

Seise has power and he'll occasionally show it to the opposite field in games, though his feel to hit is generally a little raw.

Assuming it's fine returning from the surgery, Seise has the arm for anywhere on the infield. Staying at short takes some pressure off of what might be a suspect contact profile, as the power gives Seise a great chance of playing there everyday even if he whiffs a lot.

But he missed all of 2018 after hurting his throwing shoulder and having rotator-cuff surgery, then played just 21 games this year before injuring his left shoulder sliding into a base and requiring season-ending labrum surgery.  With Seise's size, bat speed and developing strength, he has more power than the typical shortstop. To get the most out of his power potential and hit for average, he'll have to improve his plate discipline and guard against his right-handed swing getting too long.

He's increasingly likely to max out as a 40 hitter, or thereabouts, which makes it imperative that Severino learn to attack pitches he can drive and take his share of walks.   An amateur shortstop -- he signed for $1.9 million with the Braves in their deep 2016 July 2nd class but was declared a free agent due to the Braves violations in the international realm, then signed for an additional $2.5 million bonus with Minnesota -- Severino made all of seven 2019 starts at second base before hurting his thumb, and should settle in there.

After one year in the organization, he was declared a free agent in the wake of the Braves' international signing violations and the Twins signed him just a few weeks later for $2.5 million. He had a solid organizational debut in 2018 in the rookie-level Appalachian League, getting a chance to join full-season Cedar Rapids during their Midwest League playoff run to close out his season.  While Severino's numbers look better facing right-handed pitching thus far, the Twins think the switch-hitter's right-handed swing is underrated and should catch up in time. He's still figuring things out at the plate and needs to refine his approach and pitch recognition, which should allow him to tap into surprising raw power. Right now, Severino is an average runner, but speed isn't a part of his game.  One thing that's unclear is where Severino will play defensively long-term. He patterns his game after Robinson Cano, including wanting to play second base. The Twins think he has the hands and arm to handle shortstop, and he did see some time on the left side of the infield in 2018.

Reed reached base consistently, and he wreaked havoc on the bases, swiping 51 bags between Lake Elsinore and Double-A San Antonio. Reed earned his Double-A promotion after playing in the All-Star Futures Game at Nationals Park. His transition wasn't so smooth, however, as the swing-and-miss crept back into his game in San Antonio, and he batted just .179 in 43 appearances.   A switch-hitter, Reed has the potential to hit for both average and power. Before the 2018 season, he made an adjustment, allowing him to be shorter to the ball with more extension after contact. But he'll need to continue to cut down on the strikeouts. If he can add more contact to his game, he has plus-plus speed -- which translates on both sides of the ball.  Reed has a tall, athletic build that gives him the potential to do a lot of things well on the baseball field, but he still has gains to make as a hitter.

He ended up going in the fourth round of the 2018 Draft and signing an over pick value deal with the Reds. Now it's his brother's turn and while scouts were a little more bullish on Mike, Sammy's performance at events like the Tournament of Stars and East Coast Pro Showcase put him firmly on the radar.  Siani's standout tool is his left-handed bat. The outfielder has an outstanding and smooth swing and showed the ability to make consistent contact against some of the better prep arms in the country. He's hit over power with a good approach at the plate, but some might be light on his power because of his smallish frame. Siani does get into trouble at times chasing first pitches out of the zone too often. He might not be the plus defender his brother is, but he could a capable left fielder with a solid average arm.  It's not always easy to get good looks at cold-weather high school players, so teams thinking about taking him in the top two rounds and signing him away from his Duke commitment might be doing so based on his strong summer performances.

At some point in 2018, his hands became more active and his swing took on more movement, becoming whippy and more explosive, and the quality of Reyes' contact was able to improve without costing him much in the way of contact. It culminated in an eye-opening September cup of coffee -- an apt phrase for Reyes, who plays like he is extremely caffeinated --  during which Reyes slashed .293/.349/.483. September numbers can be noisy because the talent pool has been diluted by roster expansion, but we're cautiously optimistic that Reyes has become a different hitter. Namely, a gap-to-gap hitter capable of really punishing pitchers who try to beat him with heat on the inner half.   Defensively, he's perfectly fine at third base and in the outfield corners, and fringy at second base; we'd rather not have him play shortstop.

But a strong year in Triple-A in 2018 led to a September callup to Pittsburgh, where his energy on the field made many new fans.  If the Pirates could bottle Reyes, they'd have the best energy drink on the market. He plays with infectious energy at all times, making him an exciting player to watch. Though he's just 5-foot-8, there is some impact from the right side of the plate thanks to very good bat speed in his buggy whip of a swing.

His fastball has nasty natural cut action, especially when he's working to his glove side, and at times his upper-80s slider has bat-missing vertical action. It often does not, and he throws a lot of 40-grade sliders. Kenley Jansen dominated for years with a naturally cutting fastball.

While lightning quick, his arm action is quite violent, which detracts from Fernandez's command and has created a perception of heightened injury risk. But he also has an upper-90s fastball and plus changeup when healthy and reached Double-A as a 21-year-old last year. The Cardinals are incentivized to extract big league value out of Fernandez while he's healthy and has good stuff, so it's possible we see him and his high-leverage offering as early as next year. \"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","","\"July 2, 2014 - STL\"","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Following the same path top prospect Alex Reyes did -- starting high school in the United States but then moving to the Dominican Republic and signing as an international free agent -- Fernandez landed a $400,000 bonus at the outset of the 2014 international signing period. He created quite a buzz in the Gulf Coast League during his United States debut in 2015 with his triple-digit fastball and dominant outings, then threw well with a jump to full-season ball in 2016 before some late struggles in the Florida State League. While a return to that level in 2017 went much better for the right-hander, he was shut down at the end of July with some arm tenderness that would keep him off the mound until June the next year.   Even after his arm trouble, Fernandez still has one of the best fastballs in the system, one that reaches 99 mph, and he can combine it with a changeup that flashes plus. However, Fernandez's breaking ball and command both have been slow to develop, and he's never quite dominated the way someone with his premium stuff should. His slider is fringe-average on its best days, and he can be predictable with how he sequences his fastball-changeup pairing. His control comes and goes, leading to elevated walk rates, while his lack of feel for pitching hasn't allowed him to miss as many bats as he should.  The Cardinals moved Fernandez to the bullpen last summer upon his return from injury both to protect him from future injuries and because they believe his strengths will be accentuated more in the role. If he can stay healthy and make the necessary improvements, Fernandez could soon find himself in the Cardinals' big league bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","16","\"2014 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","20","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"50.0\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2150","40","60","55","","40","","","45","60","60","","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","55","","45","","","","45","\"PHI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["548","545","584","732","577","\"44.8\"","\"44.0\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.9\"","\"47.7\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Braden\"","\"Bishop\"","2019","\"25.8\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1116","623323","\"bishop_braden\"","17806","\"sa659045\"","\"|\"","","\"Washington\"","1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","","","\"Bishop's 2018 season ended in July when he was hit by a pitch and suffered a fractured forearm. Though he has made swing tweaks that have dropped his groundball rate from a whopping 60% to 48% (which is still greater than league average), he is unlikely to do much offensive damage, and probably not enough to profile as an average everyday player. But he can really go get it in center field, and could turn into a Kevin Pillar type of regular who ends up playing every day simply because of how good he is in the field. A plus-plus runner with expansive range at the position, Bishop is capable of turning would-be extra-base hits into outs, and his speed and instincts on the basepaths will make him a dynamic pinch running option if he ends up in a bench outfield role, which most teams believe to be his median outcome.

The local team, the Mariners, liked his profile in center field enough to take him in the third round of the 2015 Draft. Though a broken arm caused by a hit by pitch ended his season in late July 2018, the Texas League All-Star was added to the 40-man roster during the offseason.  Bishop's calling card is still his play in center field, though he has made strides at the plate. He uses his outstanding speed to cover a lot of ground and is a premium defender up the middle, with a strong arm to boot. While his offensive game is still very much contact-oriented, Bishop has embraced changes to his swing, including the lowering of his hands and more of a leg kick to get more launch angle, and is impacting the ball more consistently. He's still controlling the strike zone well, drawing walks and limiting strikeouts, but he is driving the ball more and has a higher ISO in 2018 as evidence, with most of his home run juice coming to the pull side.  The Mariners have talked to Bishop about reincorporating basestealing into his offensive game. He swiped 22 bases in 2017, but only five a year later. If his offense keeps ticking upward and he can be more aggressive on the basepaths, he has the chance to be an everyday catalyst in center field and at or near the top of a big league lineup.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"MLB\"","14","\"2015 Draft Rnd 3 (SEA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"48.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","40","50","70","70","55","40","40","50","70","70","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","35","65","55","65","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["549","546","585","733","546","\"44.8\"","\"44.0\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.1\"","\"47.0\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","\"Ryan\"","\"Hendrix\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1801","641682","\"hendrix_ryan\"","","\"sa738145\"","\"|\"","","\"Texas A&M\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"pKSAWmEnH-A\"","","\"Hendrix went in the 5th round in 2016 as a relief-only, power curveball guy (you could also just call it a slider, we've heard it both ways) with some command issues.

His power stuff has played well in the lower levels of the Minors, and he was a Florida State League All-Star in 2018.    With big stuff that projects well for the Major Leagues as a reliever, Hendrix has two effective pitches with a plus-plus 94-98 mph fastball and an above-average power curveball that ranges from 87-90 mph. There is no question he has swing-and-miss stuff, with a 12.3 K/9 ratio entering 2019. He also gets a lot of weak contact on the ground, as evidenced by his 1.60 GO/AO ratio through the 2018 season.    Hendrix still has work to do to sharpen his command and control after he had 4.9 walks-per-nine innings last season at Daytona while he posted a 1.76 ERA in 44 games.

He didn't start focusing exclusively on pitching until JUCO, and was up to 95 mph with an above average curveball, so he was seen more as an upside relief type, but it's gone better than most clubs expected in pro ball. Nelson sits 94-97 and hits 98 mph even as a starter, and mixes in the same above-average curveball but has also added a 55-flashing splitter, and, starting in instructs, added a 88-91 mph cutter that flashed average. The overall command is still a bit below average, mostly due to below average command of his off-speed stuff. Nelson can sometimes get cute and pitch backwards rather than focusing on developing fastball command and throwing his best pitch more often. There's still a shot that he can turn into a traditional starting pitcher, but it looks more likely that he'll be some kind of multi-inning middle relief or setup guy. After a solid 2018 that ended with a taste of Double-A, Nelson should begin 2019 there and may be in line for a big league look at the end of the year if the team needs some bullpen help in the Bronx.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","\"2016, 4th (128) - NYY\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Nelson turned down the Giants when they drafted him as a pitcher in the 31st round in 2014 in favor of playing both ways at Gulf Coast State (Fla.)

The Yankees signed him away from a Florida commitment for a below-slot $350,000 in the fourth round in 2016, and his stuff has improved since he has focused fully on pitching. Though he lacks polish, he reached Double-A and led New York farmhands in strikeout rate (10.7 per nine innings) in 2018.  Nelson misses bats and generates groundouts with his power repertoire, which starts with a 94-98 mph four-seam fastball that he can maintain into the late innings. His hard curveball often works as a second plus pitch though there are times when he can't land it for strikes. He also has a low-90s splitter and an upper-80s slider/cutter that have their moments but similarly lack consistency.  Though Nelson is strong and athletic, he's still figuring out how to repeat his delivery and command his pitches.

He has a funky, low-slot delivery that creates cuttery, horizontal movement on his slider. It's his best way to miss bats. His changeup and fastball (which was only in the upper-80s for much of his time in the Arizona Fall League) are both fringy on their own but play up a bit due to the deceptive funk in his delivery.

After the Red Sox saw him strike out 16 in the Big Ten Conference tournament during his final college start, they drafted him in the fifth round and paid him a well above-slot $637,500. He has zoomed through the Minors, reaching Triple-A last August and averaging 9.7 strikeouts per nine innings through his first three pro seasons.  Shawaryn relies heavily on a plus low-80s slider that he also can turn into a mid-80s cutter whenever he wants. His fastball isn't overpowering at 90-94 mph with some run and sink, but he'll bust it inside against right-handers and then sweep sliders and cutters away from them. He can back-foot his slider against left-handers and also hold them in check with his fading changeup.  Shawaryn's low-three-quarters arm slot adds deception and life to his pitches without hampering his ability to throw them for strikes. His control has improved as he has risen through the Minors, enhancing his chances of becoming a durable back-of-the-rotation starter.

A three-quarters slinger with mid-90s heat, Garcia also has a plus slider, and we think the movement profile on the fastball mimics his changeup in such a way that the cambio will be serviceable, as well.

However, Garcia's fast track was derailed in early 2018 when he needed Tommy John surgery right at the start of Spring Training.  When healthy, Garcia has a fastball-slider combination that is good enough to compete with at the Major League level. He throws his fastball up to 95-96 mph regularly and his breaking ball will flash plus, missing bats to the tune of a 12.8 K/9 rate in 2017. The Tigers have encouraged him to work on his changeup more, a serviceable pitch now that could be average and give him a legitimate third weapon. With the exception of his time in Triple-A, he was generally around the strike zone with enough command to succeed in late relief.

Tarnok is, as expected, still raw, but it's easy to see what Braves scouts were so excited about: he has near-ideal body and arm action along with standout arm strength, athleticism, and ability to spin the ball. The finer points of pitching, how to mix all of his pitches, and dialing in the repetition of his delivery are still variables, all stemming from his lack of innings.

Knowing he was a bit of a project, the projectable right-hander didn't pitch much his first summer of pro ball and was held back in extended spring camp to start the 2018 season. But Tarnok took a big step forward by pitching well in full-season ball last summer.  The more the Braves see Tarnok, the more confidence they have in his ability to pitch at the highest level and withstand the rigors of a long season, with the chance to be a starter. He's starting to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame, which should help him maintain his stuff deep into starts. He tops out at 96 mph and should settle in at 93-94 mph, a pitch that plays up because of his excellent extension and finish. His power breaking ball should be at least average, and he continues to improve his changeup.  More than anything, Tarnok needs innings as someone who didn't pitch until his junior year of high school.

While Bowden has moved faster so far as a pro, Harrison has emerged as the better prospect since signing for $477,8000. After a brief pro debut, he impressed club officials with his steady improvement while pitching at a pair of Rookie-ball levels last summer.   Francis has a nice foundation to develop as a starter. His three-pitch mix is headlined by a low-90s fastball with late movement that nets him whiffs as well as weak contact. He pulls the string on hitters with an excellent changeup that already earns above-average grades. Spinning a more consistent curveball will be a focal point for Francis moving forward, but club officials are encouraged by his progress to date.  An aggressive delivery is the only thing that gives evaluators pause when projecting Francis as a long-term starter. But he repeats it well for the most part and should learn to do so more consistently as he adds strength to his solid frame.

He was limited to just 42 games at Hi-A, and two in the Fall League. While at Hi-A Carolina, he struck out in 36% of his plate appearances. Feliciano also has one of the higher ceilings in this system. He turned 20 shortly before this list went to press, so his inabiltiy to perform as an 18-year-old in full-season ball in 2017 and a 19-year-old at Hi-A in 2018 is less troublesome due to his age. When healthy, Feliciano has shown bat control and above-average power on contact. If he can develop defensively (a process which has, thus far, been slow due to the reps lost to injury), Feliciano will be a catcher with a complete offensive profile, and a potential star. Teenage catching prospects are notoriously volatile and often, a decline in physical tools and/or stagnant defensive development starts with chronic injury. Feliciano's 2018 is what the start of past catching bust narravites look like. This is a very talented, volatile prospect who could be at or near the top of this list next year or be off it in two. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2016, CBB (75) - MIL\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  As a high school senior in Puerto Rico in 2016, Feliciano impressed scouts with his hitting ability, power potential and overall athleticism behind the plate. The Brewers took him with the No. 75 overall pick that June, signing him for $800,000. After a solid first full season at Class A Wisconsin that included Midwest League All-Star honors, nagging injuries plagued Feliciano in 2018, limiting him to just 42 regular-season games. He was assigned to the Arizona Fall League after the season so that he could make up some of the lost developmental time but instead experienced shoulder discomfort and underwent arthroscopic surgery in November.   The Brewers continue to be high on the young catcher's upside at the plate. Feliciano works with a clean right-handed swing when he's healthy, showing feel for the barrel and the ability to make hard contact to all fields that portend to solid averages in his future. That knack for making contact can also work against Feliciano, at times causing him to expand his zone and make weak contact on pitches off the plate. And while his average raw power hasn't shown up in games yet, the Brewers believe he'll have at least modest over-the-fence power once he adds more strength and learns to better leverage his swing.   Feliciano is an impressive athlete who runs surprisingly well and shows agility behind the plate. He's a solid receiver and framer, especially to his glove side, while his quick transfer and above-average arm strength translate to average-or-better pop times. Many of the defensive gains he needs to make should happen organically with health and experience, and club officials are confident he'll make enough adjustments along the way to allow his bat-first profile to play at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"A+\"","6","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"34.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","-1.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","30","50","40","30","55","55","45","55","30","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","40","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["556","553","452","469","402","\"44.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.9\"","\"44.2\"","\"50.4\"","\"|\"","\"John\"","\"Doxakis\"","2019","\"20.8\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"76\"","\"215\"","\"draft\"","325","8","\"|\"","2849","","\"doxakis_john\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Texas A&M\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","\"Doxakis works 89-93 with solid average stuff as a pitchability lefty that can eat innings.\"","\"Doxakis works 88-92 with solid average stuff as a pitchability lefty that can eat innings.

He spent his freshman year as a swingman, winning the game that sent the Aggies to the College World Series, and has been one of the Southeastern Conference's best starters the past two seasons. He outdueled 2018 No. 1 overall pick Casey Mize at the '18 SEC tournament and could become A&M's highest pick since Tyler Naquin and Michael Wacha went in the top 19 selections seven years ago.    Doxakis has effort in his delivery and uses an arm slot that varies from low- to mid-three-quarters, yet that doesn't prevent him from pounding the strike zone with three pitches. He doesn't dazzle radar guns with his 88-93 mph fastball, but it plays up because of its armside run and his ability to command it to both sides of the plate. He masterfully manipulates his low-80s slider, changing velocities and shape and demonstrating the ability to back-foot it against right-handers.     Though Doxakis' changeup is less reliable than his other two offerings, it features some fade and shows flashes of becoming a solid third pitch. Some scouts look at the stress with which he throws and peg him as a reliever, and he did hit 97 mph as a freshman in that role, but he has the three-pitch repertoire, control and durable frame to start and the makeup to get the most out of his ability.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","","41","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","111","61","\"TBR\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"42.5\"","\"50.8\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","0.0000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","40","45","","50","","","50","50","50","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","55","","","","55","","",""],["557","554","453","384","786","\"44.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"44.3\"","\"47.6\"","\"40.1\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jake\"","\"McCarthy\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","2417","664983","\"mccarthy_jake\"","","\"sa3007015\"","\"|\"","","\"Virginia\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"IH5IkDg_WVs\"","","\"McCarthy's older brother Joe was a hyped prospect who slid on draft day due to a down spring stemming from a back issue. Jake also missed most of his draft spring, but with a broken wrist. He returned not long before the draft and did not look very good, and teams had mixed opinions about him on draft day. Some thought he just needed more time to get back to full strength and speed, while others were scared off by their post-injury looks, which were so bad that multiple scouts told us they thought he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft.   At his best, McCarthy shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit, and is a center field fit. His swing is naturally geared for opposite field contact, which will likely cap his power output unless he undergoes a swing change. That will be less necessary if McCarthy stays in center field. Season-long failure to hit in the Cal League will leave us with more questions about McCarthy than we had entering the year, especially if his early-season struggles with strikeouts persist.\"","\"|\"","","\"ARI\"","\"2018, CBA (39) - ARI\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The younger brother of Joe McCarthy, a University of Virginia product whom the Rays drafted in the fifth round in 2015, Jake put himself on the Draft radar with a breakout sophomore campaign for the Cavaliers. A broken wrist limited him to just 20 games as a junior, but the D-backs liked him enough to nab him with the No. 39 overall pick and sign him for $1.65 million, just below pick value. The layoff had little impact on McCarthy's pro debut, as he impressed in all facets of the game while reaching the Class A Short Season Northwest League.   McCarthy has a solid track record at the plate, as he finished his Cavaliers career with a .337 average and then hit .288 in his pro debut, while showing more extra-base pop. His left-handed swing can be a bit rigid and features a flat bat path, but he tends to make consistently hard contact. His approach has been much more hit over power, but some tweaks to his swing mechanics and better use of his lower half could allow him to tap into more raw pop. A plus runner, McCarthy has the speed and instincts to stay in center field, where he profiles as at least an above-average defender.   McCarthy is the type of advanced college hitter who could move quickly through the D-backs' system. There's everyday potential in the profile, especially if he can hit for more power, while his left-handed-hitting ability, speed and strong defense all portend to a high floor.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"A+\"","16","\"2018 Draft Rnd 1 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.2\"","\"49.1\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","25","50","60","45","40","50","40","50","60","50","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","60","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"STL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["558","555","425","738","123","\"44.8\"","\"45.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"52.7\"","\"48.1\"","\"53.2\"","\"|\"","\"Steven\"","\"Gingery\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"LHP\"","\"R\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","3027","663451","\"gingery_steven\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Texas Tech\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","40","\" \"","","\"Gingery won't make his pro debut until some time in 2019 because he was drafted and signed while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery in March of his draft year. He hit the big stage as a key part of the Texas Tech rotation in a 2017 College World Series run as a sophomore, then pitched for collegiate Team USA that summer, where most scouts saw him for the first time. Gingery walked off the mound the following February with that elbow injury, but the Cardinals had seen enough to give him $825,000 in the 4th round, as he had buzz in the top two rounds before the injury. He's a typical back-end type lefty starter, with average or better command, who works 88-92 mph with an average fastball/curveball combo, but backs it up with a plus changeup he uses as a weapon in almost any situation. With the success rate of Tommy John surgery somewhere around 75% (depending on your definition of success), expectations are that Gingery will be back to what he was (which is similar to former Cardinals first rounder Marco Gonzales, though not quite as athletic) by the end of 2019 or early in 2020, with a chance to move quickly if everything goes to plan.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2018, 4th (123) - STL\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 65 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  Despite his lack of size and premium stuff, Gingery was having an outstanding collegiate career at Texas Tech, serving as the team's No. 2 starter during its College World Series run in 2016 and earning Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Year honors the following season. After a strong turn with the U.S. national collegiate team last summer, there was excitement about his junior season, but it ended early when he blew out his elbow in February and needed Tommy John surgery. The Cardinals decided it was worth the risk to take Gingery and let him rehab with their staff, signing him in the fourth round for an above-pick-value bonus of $825,000.  Gingery's velocity on his fastball is fringy, sitting at 88-92 mph and occasionally touching 94, but it plays up because it has good sink and he can command it to both sides of the plate. It's also helped by his best pitch, a plus fading changeup that was among the best in the 2018 Draft class. Gingery has an average curveball as well, one that he throws for strikes consistently.  Gingery's ceiling is somewhat limited to that of a back-end starter. At the same time, he does have a fairly high floor as a pitchability lefty who can eat a lot of innings and is a plus competitor.

His control regressed pretty badly in 2018 and this, combined with his addition to the 40-man, make it more likely that he ends up in a relief role. Both the quality of his breaking ball and his fastball velocity vary pretty dramatically, but when they're both dialed in, Guzman can dominate without throwing a lot of strikes, mostly by bullying hitters with his heater. He is stiff, oddly postured, and may not have the necessary athleticism to repeat his delivery. The Marlins should continue developing him as a starter so he gets more reps with both his change (which got better in 2018 and has a chance to miss bats one day) and breaking ball, but we think they'll pull the ripcord eventually and let Guzman breath fire in late innings.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","","\"June 15, 2014 - HOU\"","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Initially signed by the Astros for $22,500 out of the Dominican Republic at the end of the 2013-14 international signing period, Guzman was traded to the Yankees along with right-hander Albert Abreu for Brian McCann in November 2016. Thirteen months later, New York shipped him along with Starlin Castro and shortstop Jose Devers to the Marlins for Giancarlo Stanton. Guzman pitched in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game during his first season with his third organization but also saw his control and command regress significantly.  With a quick arm and little effort, Guzman sits at 95-98 mph with the ability to reach triple digits in the late innings. He has thrown as hard as 103 mph but his velocity is more impressive than his fastball command, and the latter will dictate how quickly he moves up the ladder. He also can miss bats with his power slider and a changeup that's improving as he uses it more.  He's similar to fellow Marlins power righties Sandy Alcantara and Edward Cabrera, though scouts are less optimistic about Guzman's ability to harness his stuff. His walk rate jumped from 2.4 per nine innings in 2017 to 6.0 last year.

He walked nearly a batter per inning. His 2019 still hasn't really gotten off the ground. He was added to the 40-man in November but had arm soreness in the spring and didn't pitch in a big league spring game while he worked on his mechanics in minor league camp.

Outside of the Reds' Hunter Greene, no pitching prospect generates premium velocity as easily as Alvarez, whose athleticism and outstanding arm speed allow him to maintain a 94-98 mph fastball as a starter and reach 101 at his best. Both his upper-80s slider and lower-80s curveball can be wipeout pitches, with his slider the better of the two, and he even has flashed a plus changeup on occasion.  Alvarez has wow stuff yet little feel for using it. He doesn't maintain the tempo of his delivery or keep it in sync, diminishing the quality of his pitches and leading to scattershot control.

Chatham went to Florida Atlantic, where he moved to shortstop and blossomed into the highest pick in school history (51st overall) as well as the Conference USA player and defensive player of the year in 2016. Persistent hamstring injuries limited him to seven games during his first full pro season, but he stayed healthy in 2018 and finished second in the Class A Advanced Carolina League batting race at .315.  Chatham's most valuable attribute is his ability to make consistent line-drive contact. He hinted at average raw power as an amateur that has yet to translate to home run production as a pro, though Boston hopes he can unlock more pop if he adds some strength to his lanky frame and some loft to his relatively flat right-handed swing. He has average speed and is effective on the bases, albeit not much of a threat to steal.  His instincts and quick first step allow Chatham to cover ground and get the job done at shortstop. He still has a strong arm and soft hands, and he should be able to play second or third base if needed.

In pro ball, Weigel was able to put it together as a starter, continuing to run his heater into the upper-90's, but working more 92-94 mph with a four pitch mix that was also average or better. Due to the power of his repertoire and approach, and his long frame, Weigel had the sort of fringy command that made him seem better suited to being a multi-inning reliever than a starter. He underwent Tommy John surgery once he reached Triple-A in 2017 and returned to the mound late in 2018. In instructional league, Weigel's arm speed was mostly back, hitting 96 mph, but the stamina and crispness of his offspeed pitches wasn't quite there yet. It's still too early to expect him to be completely back and there's an expectation that he will return to his prior form in the upcoming season. That belief led the Braves to add him to the 40-man, as he would've been a strong candidate for a rebuilding team looking to buy low on him in the Rule 5 Draft.\"","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","\"2015, 7th (210) - ATL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting Grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Weigel bounced around to three different colleges as an amateur and after a solid junior season pitching in relief at the University of Houston, the Braves made him their seventh-round pick in 2015. Given a chance to start, the big right-hander had reached Triple-A and was just about knocking on the big league door when he needed Tommy John surgery. He did return at the very end of the summer in 2018 and participated in instructional league play.  Now back in the bullpen full-time, there's a chance Weigel's power stuff will play up. He pitched at 93-94 mph as a starter but showed the ability to get 97-98 mph on occasion. There's an expectation that he'll be able to pitch there consistently in shorter stints. He does have two distinct breaking balls, and he'll go back and forth depending on which one he has a better feel for. It might behoove him to focus on one, with the slider the leading candidate, in relief. His changeup does give him an option against left-handed hitters.

Starring in the Cape Cod League after his sophomore season gave him a chance to go in the first round, but control problems caused him to slide to the fourth in 2017. He has cleaned up his delivery since signing and threw more strikes while reaching Class A Advanced in his first full pro season.  Solomon has three pitches that grade as plus at their best. His most reliable offering is his four-seam fastball and he can maintain its 92-96 mph velocity deep into starts and over the course of a season. His breaking pitches aren't as consistent, but his curveball can be a hammer at times and he can turn his hard slider into an even harder cutter.   Solomon's changeup lags behind his other pitches yet helps keep left-handers off balance and could become an average offering if he uses it more. He averaged 5.3 walks per nine innings during his college career, which got him banished to the Fighting Irish bullpen as a junior, but he sliced his walk rate to 2.9 last season. He has a chance to become a mid-rotation starter if he continues to progress, and he could have a mid-90s fastball with power breaking stuff if he lands in the bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"A+\"","21","\"2017 Draft Rnd 4 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"48.1\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2550","40","55","40","55","50","40","","45","55","45","55","50","45","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","55","","","","45","","",""],["565","562","512","728","273","\"44.7\"","\"44.6\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"48.4\"","\"51.2\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"King\"","2019","\"24.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","3011","650633","","","\"sa874220\"","\"|\"","","\"Boston College\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2019","40","","","\"Considering how much of the current Marlins regime came over from New York, one would think the two orgs would not only target similar types of talent but also have similar developmental vision for that talent. This does not appear to have been the case with King, who was a prospect afterthought when he was part of a seemingly innocuous trade between the Marlins and Yankees just after the 2017 season. King had been a Marlins 12th round pick out of Boston College a year and a half prior to the deal and, like clockwork, had only struck out about six batters per nine innings every year in college, as well as in his first two pro seasons. The Marlins altered King's position on the rubber and made other mechanical tweaks to alter the movement profile of his pitches. After the Yankees acquired him, they let him return to what he was doing in college and he vastly exceeded even the most optimistic expectations in 2018. He led the Yankees system in strikeouts and innings while traversing three levels, reaching Triple-A.   The lynchpin of King's success is his command of a dancing two-seam fastball that runs back onto his glove-side corner of the plate. Left-handed hitters think it's coming at their hip, righties give up on it because they think it's off the plate, and King gets a lot of looking strikeouts with it. There are questions about the quality of his secondary stuff. He has a quality changeup, but his breaking ball is mediocre. He seems to have added a cutter late in the year, and that pitch's movement may better complement that of his fastball. Most teams have King evaluated as a stable backend starter; some think he should be in the 45 FV tier of this list. A purported nerd and exhaustive pre-start preparer, King is a high-probability big leaguer who we believe has limited ceiling, though if he develops 7 or 8 command, all bets are off.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","\"2016, 12th (353) - MIA\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 45  The Yankees accomplished three objectives in a November 2017 trade with the Marlins: clearing spots on their 40-man roster by dealing Garrett Cooper and Caleb Smith, acquiring international bonus pool money and grabbing King. Miami had drafted him in the 12th round in 2016, when he earned Boston College's lone victory in the only NCAA super-regional appearance in the program's history. He had a spectacular season after changing organizations, ranking second in the Minors in ERA (1.79) and third in WHIP (0.91) while rising from Class A Advanced to Triple-A.  King's success centers on precision command of a two-seam fastball that sits at 92-95 mph. He can run or sink his heater to either corner of the plate, and he's an extreme ground-ball pitcher with a career groundout/airout ratio of 1.7 through his first three pro seasons. The Yankees also helped him improve his secondary pitches, leading to a jump in his strikeout rate from 6.3 per nine innings in two years in Miami's system to 8.5 in his first in New York's.  Both King's slider and changeup can be solid pitches when they're working, and evaluators generally prefer his slider by a slight margin. He has the best control and command among Yankees pitching prospects and one of the highest floors as well. Regarded as a finesse right-hander who might fit at the back of a rotation at the time of his trade, he now he appears to be more than that.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"AAA\"","32","\"2016 Draft Rnd 12 (MIA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"50.7\"","\"52.5\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2300","45","55","45","","45","50","","50","55","50","","45","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","","55","","","","60","","",""],["566","563","491","729","274","\"44.7\"","\"44.7\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"49.5\"","\"51.1\"","\"|\"","\"Taylor\"","\"Clarke\"","2019","\"26.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1134","664199","\"clarke_taylor\"","17611","\"sa874810\"","\"|\"","","\"Charleston\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2019","40","","","\"Clarke has a four-pitch mix that plays in part because of big extension.

He hasn't disappointed, reaching Double-A in his first full season and Triple-A the next year, all while finishing among the system leaders in ERA, strikeouts and wins two seasons in a row. He returned to Triple-A and continued to make progress in 2018, pitching to a 4.02 ERA in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League while tossing a career-high 152 frames. The performance earned Clarke a spot on Arizona's 40-man roster after the season.   Clarke is a well-rounded pitcher who receives high marks for his durability and pitchability. He has a four-pitch arsenal that he fills the strike zone with aggressively, albeit without a true plus offering. He's not a huge strikeout guy, averaging 7.9 K/9 for his career, nor does he get a ton of ground-ball outs. He does, however, have a knack for keeping hitters from barreling up the baseball consistently. Clarke has good command of a fastball that touches 95 mph and typically sits in the low 90s, and his slider serves as his go-to secondary offering. His changeup improved in 2018 and plays nicely off his fastball, and he also can mix in a slower 12-to-6 curveball for strike one on occasion.  The fact that Clarke lacks a plus secondary pitch and doesn't miss a ton of bats gives him a smaller margin for error and thus likely limits his ceiling to that of a back-end starter. He could be a good in that role, though, thanks to his feel for sequencing pitches and inducing weak contact, and he'll enter 2019 on the cusp of the Major Leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"MLB\"","24","\"2015 Draft Rnd 3 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"52.1\"","\"47.9\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2350","50","50","50","50","","50","","55","50","50","50","","50","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","45","50","","","","55","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["567","564","492","730","228","\"44.7\"","\"44.7\"","\"41.4\"","\"51.3\"","\"49.2\"","\"51.5\"","\"|\"","\"Zach\"","\"Pop\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2122","647315","\"pop_zach\"","","\"sa829370\"","\"|\"","","\"Kentucky\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","40","","","\"Pop didn't start pitching until his junior year of high school, but he was quickly into the low-90s and the Blue Jays made a late-round run at him in 2014. He didn't sign, and instead ended up in Kentucky's bullpen, where his velocity climbed into the mid-90s. Late in April of his junior year, Pop had forearm issues that ended his college season and drove him down draft boards, but he's been healthy and dominant in pro ball, and had a minuscule 0.33 ERA in the Cal League before he was sent to Baltimore in the Manny Machado trade. Though he'll occasionally snap off a plus slider, a crackling, upper-90s two-seamer is Pop's best pitch, and he milks it for all it's worth, throwing it nearly 70% of the time. It has devastating armside run because of his lower slot, and it's the driving force behind his absurd 68% ground ball rate. The delivery remains a cause for concern, but of all the obvious, relief-only prospects in this system, we think Pop has the best chance to turn into a high-leverage option.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2017, 7th (220) - LA\"","","2020","45","\"<a href=\"https://atmlb.com/2W2dfFE\">5/14: Pop undergoes Tommy John surgery</a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Pop was Canada's top high school pitching prospect in 2014, when the Blue Jays drafted him in the 23rd round. He didn't sign and honored his commitment to Kentucky, where he showed one of the most powerful arms in the Southeastern Conference while pitching mostly out of the Wildcats' bullpen. A right forearm strain wiped out the second half of Pop's junior year, but the Dodgers still made him their seventh-round pick in June. He rewarded the organization by reaching Double-A in his first full season, earning a promotion after a dominant first half in the California League, then became Orioles property after they acquired him in a five-player prospect package for Manny Machado in July. He was limited by a balky right elbow in his first Spring Training with the O's but began the season on schedule, only to require Tommy John surgery in early May.   Pop works in the mid-90s, can reach back for 97, and in the past has been up to 99 mph with a plus-plus sinker that he throws from a lower arm slot. The combination of velocity and late movement gives Pop the ability to generate ground balls at an elite rate -- his 65.8 percent ground-ball rate in 2018 was the sixth-best mark among Minor League hurlers (60 IP min.) -- while also missing a healthy number of bats. His hard slider in the mid- to upper-80s is a plus pitch, albeit one that stands out more for its velocity than its sharpness. Pop's sinker-slider pairing makes him lethal against right-handed hitters, whom he limited to a paltry .162/.243/.200 batting line in '18.   Pop has the pure stuff needed to carve out a late-inning role in the big leagues, perhaps even as a closer if he can further improve the action on his slider and refine his command.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","20","\"2017 Draft Rnd 7 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","19","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"53.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2450","40","70","","","60","","","45","70","","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","","","60","","","","45","","",""],["568","565","493","290","1218","\"44.7\"","\"44.7\"","\"45.0\"","\"42.5\"","\"42.5\"","\"42.5\"","\"|\"","\"Joe\"","\"Charles\"","2019","\"19.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"unknown\"","\"190\"","\"draft\"","40","1","\"|\"","2969","","\"charles_joe\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TNXL Academy (Fla.)\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-joe-charles-rhp\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  TNXL Academy was founded in 2014 in the greater Orlando area in the hopes to create a place for high school players to take their games to the next level. It's had four players drafted in the past two years, but only one -- Ryan Dease a fourth-rounder in 2017 -- taken in the top 10 rounds. Charles left The First Academy for TNXL this season and could very well be the next, though a commitment to North Carolina could stand in the way.  Based solely on arm strength, Charles deserves to be much higher on this list. He's up to 96-97 mph consistently with his fastball and there could be more in the tank with some tweaks to his delivery, though his four-seamer is fairly straight. There's some violence to his delivery, with a short arm action, that impacts his ability to command his heater and his secondary stuff. He throws a power curve which sometimes gets slurvy and morphs into his slider, with some scouts thinking the slider would be a better option given his arm action. He does have a changeup, which can be effective at times, but he never needs to throw it and needs development.  Because of his power stuff, delivery and lack of command, some see Charles as a future reliever, which is a bit of a tough profile for a high schooler.

He went undrafted and followed his commitment to Texas, where he was the regular catcher on the Longhorns' '14 College World Series team as a freshman. The Nationals made Barrera their sixth-round pick two years later and then saved money by signing him for below slot value. He's moved at a level-per-year pace through the Nats' system, finishing 2018 in the Carolina League before a stint in the Arizona Fall League.  There's a lot to like about Barrera's abilities as a catcher. He's athletic and moves well behind the plate, with agility and instincts that make him an advanced blocker and allow him to pounce on any balls put in play in the vicinity of the plate. Barrera can shut down the running game with his dynamic catch-and-throw skills and strong arm, a combination that helped him cut down attempted basestealers at an elite 49 percent clip in the Carolina League. He receives high praise for his receiving and framing, too, and his game-calling has improved as he's gained experience, making him a favorite among Nats pitchers and coaches.   Barrera lacks impact potential at the plate, but he has a solid track record of production, with a swing and approach that enable him to make consistent contact and occasionally tap into some of his pull-side raw power from the right side. The potential is there for Barrera to develop into a regular behind the plate, though not without him first making more improvements at the plate.

He wrapped his 2017 season with short, statistically insignificant stints in Hi-A, Double-A, and the Arizona Fall League, but he performed at each stop, so combined there was confidence that Neuse's early-season showing was for real despite his relatively advanced age.   He was sent right to Triple-A to start 2018 and flopped, hitting just .263/.304/.357 and striking out a concerning 32% of the time. Neuse has also thickened a bit, so while he's still an arm-reliant fit at third, he's trending more toward 3B/1B, and maybe right, than the SS/3B looks Washington gave him early in his career. The combination of the 2018 struggles and somewhat shaky standing on the defensive spectrum makes it imperative that Neuse have a bounce back 2019 performance. He's a baseball rat and younger than similarly-skilled players we've written up so far (like Mets third baseman J.D. Davis), so we're a little more bullish on a rebound here than we are elsewhere.

He parlayed a big junior season with the bat into being ranked No. 50 on MLB Pipeline's Top 200 Draft prospects list and landed with the Nationals as their second-round pick. He was having a solid first full season in A ball when he was sent to the A's along with lefty Jesus Luzardo and reliever Blake Treinin in return for Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson. Neuse made it to Double-A before that 2017 season was over and performed very well in the Arizona Fall League. He stumbled when he moved to Triple-A in 2018, but after hitting .224 in the first half, he righted the ship with a .321 second half.  When at his best, Neuse utilizes a compact and simple right-handed swing while also showing an ability to drive the ball to all fields. He came out of his gameplan in Triple-A at the start of the year, not seeing as many pitches and swinging and missing at an alarming rate. When he got back on track, his strikeout rate plummeted and he drew more walks. The power he showed in 2017 didn't completely return, but he was driving the ball a bit more.  A below-average runner, Neuse still has plenty of range to play third to go with a plus arm that fires mid-90s fastball from the mound, allowing him to stay at the hot corner long-term. There's a Matt Chapman-sized roadblock for Neuse in Oakland, so he might need to find work around the field and has seen time at his college position as well as a little time at second base in 2018.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"AAA\"","9","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (WAS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"47.3\"","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","35","60","40","45","60","40","50","60","40","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","40","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["571","568","471","467","451","\"44.7\"","\"44.9\"","\"42.9\"","\"49.6\"","\"44.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Jeren\"","\"Kendall\"","2019","\"23.3\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","854","656607","\"kendall_jeren\"","","\"sa829529\"","\"|\"","","\"Vanderbilt\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","42","\"r2TAFjALtKw\"","\" \"","\"Wielding uncommon tools for a college prospect, perhaps the most explosive since George Springer was at UConn, Kendall was on the short list of 2017 1-1 candidates when his college season began.

He entered that year as a candidate to go No. 1 overall but lasted 23 picks because of worries about his high price tag and swing-and-miss issues. The latter concern has intensified since he batted .225 with a 30 percent strikeout rate in his first two pro seasons after signing for $2,897,500.   Kendall has all of the physical tools to be a star and has drawn comparisons to Jacoby Ellsbury in his prime, but it won't matter if he doesn't hit. Scouts aren't sold that he will because he doesn't recognize pitches particularly well and misses hittable offerings in the strike zone. The Dodgers overhauled his left-handed stroke during the offseason, widening his base and altering his bat path, and they're eager to see how well the changes work in 2019.

He won Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year honors and helped the Aggies reach the College World Series in 2017, then shifted to shortstop as a sophomore. Of the half-dozen college players at that position who have legitimate first-round aspirations in 2019, he might be the best pure hitter.  His outstanding hand-eye coordination allows Shewmake to put the bat on the ball with ease. A left-handed hitter who's a bit unorthodox at the plate, he tends to get caught out on his front foot but still has the dexterity to slap singles to the opposite field. He also has the bat speed and leverage in his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame to turn on balls, hinting at average power in his future.  Shewmake grew up around the game because his father Shane is the head coach at Texas-Dallas, and his instincts are apparent on the bases and in the field. He has a knack for stealing bases despite average speed and makes plays at shortstop.

He complements it with a solid hard slider that can get slurvy at times.  While he's never going to have pinpoint command, Hernandez was doing a better job of finding the strike zone in his second season after an up-and-down debut in the United States.

It's not as simple as you may think, with most of those relief outings going multiple innings, so it seemed to be more of a mental adjustment than being better in short stints, with some sources telling us his confidence increased in that role. Peguero will turn 22 in May and has a career 6.28 ERA with no experience outside of short-season leagues, so there are some clear concerns.

His delivery is athletic and easy, and he'll throw an occasional low-90s changeup that is usable. Peguero needed more innings at a low level of competition to build into 2019 and went to the Australian Baseball League this winter, throwing 13.1 IP with 19 K and 2 BB.

He's a short strider who sometimes fails to clear his front side, causing his pitches to sail. His 2018 was much better from a strike-throwing perspective than 2017, but he still walked 12% of hitters faced, and he's very fly ball prone due to where his fastball lives in the hitting zone.

He led all Minor League relievers in strikeout rate (16.6 per nine innings) while holding opponents to a .149/.257/.218 line.  Evans' fastball explodes on hitters thanks to a combination of mid-90s velocity, high spin rates and the extension he creates in his delivery with his massive 6-foot-5 frame.

He stopped worrying about throwing his ineffective changeup when he landed in the bullpen.   The big-bodied Evans can't always keep his delivery in sync, so he'll never have pinpoint control.

He has legitimate swing-and-miss stuff, averaging 11.0 strikeouts per nine innings in his first three pro seasons.

His changeup isn't nearly as effective as his other two offerings but shows flashes of becoming an average pitch.  Because Alexy didn't start pitching full-time until he was a high school junior, he still has a lot to learn on the mound.

To his credit, he's taken advantage of the situation to take a large step forward, particularly offensively, as the Draft approached.  Lee shows a lot of power, both with his bat and with his arm. He has plus raw power and the improvements he's shown as an overall hitter make some feel it might eventually play as plus in games in the future. Coming into the spring, he was thought to be a below-average hitter, but there is more confidence it will continue to play better than that. There is some swing and miss, but nothing concerning, and he's shown an improved ability to handle quality arms this spring. While he's an easily below-average runner, he's more athletic than you'd think, runs decently and can even handle playing a corner infield spot. His arm strength shows closer to 70 at times and he's gotten better with his overall receiving.  There is a dearth of catching in this class, and college backstops always fly off the board relatively early.

He has big bat speed and projects for at least 60 raw power, along with sticking somewhere in the infield. We aren't sure how his body will develop, and thus the raw power and the position where he'll land are open questions.

Some scouts who saw Martinez as an amateur in the Dominican Republic compared him to a young Adrian Beltre as a hard-hitting infielder with a good projectable body and a strong arm. While the odds are against Martinez having a Hall of Fame-caliber career like Beltre, he does have one of the higher offensive ceilings in the system.   Martinez is a good athlete and has across-the-board tools, though it's his potential from the right side of the plate that has club officials the most excited. Combining a rhythmic swing with plus bat speed, he impacts the ball to the big parts of the field with authority. He'll need to clean up his swing some in the coming years like any young hitter, but all the ingredients are there for Martinez to develop into an average hitter. His power, meanwhile, could play close to plus when all is said and done, as Martinez has considerable room to grow into his projectable frame.   Martinez has average speed but may lose a step or two over time as he fills out physically. It may also force him from shortstop to third base long-term, though Martinez has the tools and skills, including solid defensive actions, advanced body control and above-average arm strength, needed to profile at either position. Questions about his future defensive home aside, Martinez's bat may be good enough to offset any concerns about him moving down the defensive spectrum.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","","15","\"2018 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"29.5\"","\"48.2\"","\"50.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","50","45","30","50","45","50","60","40","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","50","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["583","580","566","1081","23","\"44.6\"","\"44.1\"","\"40.0\"","\"55.9\"","\"47.5\"","\"56.7\"","\"|\"","\"Victor\"","\"Santos\"","2019","\"18.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"191\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","3266","","","","\"sa3003083\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","","\"Santos is pretty singular in the context of low-level pro ball but actually shares traits with a cluster of recent high school pitching prospects who unexpectedly grew into premium stuff. Just 17 when the season started, Santos dominated older GCL hitters for two months. He walked just four batters in eleven starts and struck out more than a batter per inning despite often sitting just 88-92. If he develops velocity, Santos could be very good very quickly because he can do everything else. He has a plus-flashing split-action changeup and can locate an average slider. His fastball moves, and he can run it back onto his gloveside corner or just off the plate to his arm side. But it's hard to say if Santos will grow into more fastball because his frame is already maxed out. The scouting reports of rising high school seniors Jesus Luzardo and Forrest Whitley read an awful lot like that before each of them altered their training and conditioning, and experienced a huge jump in velocity. Whether Santos is a candidate for 'reverse projection' in this way is hard to say, but it's fair to assume some growth on the fastball through sheer physical maturity. If Santos retains his command at greater velocities, he's going to move quickly and could be a monster.

As a starter, he works at 90-92 mph and reaches 94 with his fastball, creating some armside run with some crossfire in his delivery. He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of an upper-70s curveball that is often his best pitch, and he also can manipulate it into a harder, more lateral-breaking slider in the low 80s.  Baum also has at least an average changeup with some fade and is doing a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter in pro ball. He has a high floor as a potential No. 4 starter with a fallback of becoming at least a seventh-inning reliever.

In seven starts with Binghamton, Kilome halved his walk rate (his strike % was up six percentage points), flashed a better changeup than he had earlier in the year, and turned in his best performance of the season, striking out 10 former Reading teammates on August 3rd. After things had plateaued for so long with Philly, he seemed to be improving. Then he broke, and at an unfortunate time. Tommy John in late October means Kilome, who's already relatively raw for a prospect his age, may not throw another professional pitch until mid-2020, when he's 25. We think this makes it significantly more likely that Kilome ends up in relief and while we think he could be a dominant three-pitch reliever, it has also delayed his timeline to the big leagues by perhaps two years, putting him in line to debut near the same time as similar talents who just wrapped a season in A-ball.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","","\"Jan. 22, 2013 - PHI\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  In many ways, Kilome has done as well as, or better than, could have been expected when he signed as a gangly teenager back in 2013. He's gotten bigger and stronger and, after making his full-season debut in 2016, has moved rather quickly, reaching Double-A in '17 while finishing in the top 10 among all Phillies pitching prospects in ERA. He was spending his first full season at the level when he was dealt to the Mets for Asdrubal Cabrera. The Mets won't get a long look at him until 2020, however, as the right-hander underwent Tommy John surgery in October and will miss the 2019 season.  Pure stuff-wise, Kilome is as good as just about any pitching prospect in the system, with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s combined with a curve that often flashes plus. His changeup has improved, and it could eventually become an average third pitch, something softer to disrupt hitters' timing. He's generally around the strike zone, though his command has been inconsistent as he is still learning to get all of his 6-foot-6 frame in sync on a regular basis.  Kilome doesn't miss as many bats as his stuff suggests he should, though he stands to improve in that department as he learns to sequence pitches and set up hitters more effectively. Kilome gets high marks for his makeup and intelligence, as he learned English quickly so he could better communicate with teammates and coaches. He should continue his development as a starter when he returns in 2020, though there's a non-zero chance that Kilome, with his fastball-curveball combo, will end up in the bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"AA\"","13","\"2012 J2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","9","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.7\"","\"47.5\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2450","2450","40","60","45","55","","","","40","60","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","55","","","","","45","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["586","583","508","286","1238","\"44.6\"","\"44.6\"","\"45.0\"","\"41.6\"","\"41.6\"","\"41.6\"","\"|\"","\"Jacob\"","\"Robson\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","80","2","\"|\"","1818","615699","\"robson_jacob\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"DET\"","\"2016, 8th (235) - DET\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 65 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  The Tigers made Robson their eighth-round pick in the 2016 Draft after an injury-plagued career at Mississippi State that included a broken hand as a redshirt junior. Pegged by the organization as a breakout candidate ahead of his first full season, Robson did just that by reaching the Florida State League and finishing third in the system in batting average (.305) and fifth in stolen bases (21). The Ontario native then built upon the performance in 2018, hitting both for average and even some power as he climbed from Double-A to Triple-A.   Robson's best tool is his speed and it allows him to be a basestealing threat as well as a defensive asset in the outfield. He has played all three spots thus far, with his best chance to be a regular coming in center or left, where his fringy arm would be acceptable. He has shown a solid approach at the plate and a willingness to draw walks, and he added some power to his game in 2018 with career-high totals in home runs (11) and doubles (29), albeit at the cost of more strikeouts (140). The Tigers continue to stress bunting as a tool to help him let his legs do the talking.  Robson profiles best as a fourth outfielder or bench presence, one whose speed can do a lot of things.

Now, two-plus years after the Mariners went above pick value in the second round of that Draft to sign Rizzo for $1.75 million, he's still tough to figure out.   Rizzo had a solid first full season, holding his own in the Midwest League as a teenager, earning a late bump up to the California League, where he caught fire and won the championship series MVP. It seemed to carry over to the first half of the 2018 season back with Modesto, but then he fell into bad habits and badly regressed. He often doesn't have a lot of balance or foundation in his swing, causing him to drift. He managed to cut his strikeout rate down, but he wasn't impacting the ball like he's capable of. The Mariners have worked with Rizzo on the timing of his swing along with where his lower half and hands are. Defensively, he's still a third baseman and will stay there, though he played a handful of games at second and first base last year.  The Mariners would like Rizzo to get back to being the hitter he was at the Draft, one who made consistent hard contact with the ability to drive the ball.

Intrigued by Raquet's arm strength and untapped potential, the Nationals selected him in the third round of the 2017 Draft and signed him for $475,000. Making his full-season debut in 2018, Raquet split the year between Class A Hagerstown and Class A Advanced Potomac, garnering All-Star honors in the South Atlantic League before wearing down late in the season.   Raquet's velocity backed up some in his first full season, but the Nationals were impressed with how he developed feel to pitch and maintained effectiveness. Specifically, he took a big step forward in commanding his fastball, which sits in the low 90s with heavy sink and run that helped him generate ground balls 57 percent of the time. His curveball and slider will bleed together at times, though he did make strides in developing the latter in 2018, throwing it with more tilt and late, sharp bite in the mid-80s. Raquet rounds out his four-pitch mix with a changeup that could become average with further refinement.  The Nationals will continue to develop Raquet as a starter because they think it will give him a chance to refine his secondaries.

Terrin Vavra is the third of three brothers to head into pro ball, following their father Joe, who is still coaching in pro ball as the Tigers' quality control coach, into the family business. Terrin's also the best prospect of the trio, and after a big junior season at the University of Minnesota in 2018, he became the Rockies' third-round pick and kept on hitting during his pro debut in the short-season Northwest League.  Put simply, Vavra just hits wherever he goes. Utilizing a short stroke from the left side of the plate, he always stays within himself, focusing on using the middle of the field. The result is line drives to all fields, consistently professional at-bats with a strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, and some sneaky extra-base authority. On the other side of the ball, Vavra is a steady, but not flashy, defender who makes all the plays from multiple positions. He can handle shortstop, but his arm and range might not be a fit to be a regular there. He plays a very good second base as well.  The Rockies love infielders with positional flexibility, and Vavra will mix some third base in as he moves forward. Some in the organization compare him favorably to fellow infield prospect Garrett Hampson, without as much speed, with the competitiveness and makeup similar to, but with more offensive potential, another Rockie infielder, Pat Valaika.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","\"A\"","9","\"2018 Draft Rnd 3 (COL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"39.5\"","\"51.4\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","35","45","45","45","50","55","50","50","45","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","50","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["591","588","480","464","293","\"44.6\"","\"44.8\"","\"42.9\"","\"50.7\"","\"37.5\"","\"51.9\"","\"|\"","\"Malcom\"","\"Nunez\"","2019","\"18.2\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","3024","682650","","","\"sa3008113\"","\"|\"","","\"Cuba\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","40","\" \"","","\"Trapped in the International Amateur market's penalty box after their 2016 Cuban shopping spree, the Cardinals were still able to find some interesting $300,000 talent in each of the following two years. Nuez is the best hitter of that bunch and he posted god-like numbers in the DSL last year, slashing .415/.497/.774 with 31 extra-base hits in 44 games. Already to be taken with a healthy grain of salt, DSL numbers are often faulty when the prospect in question is more physically mature than his peers, and the hefty Nuez is a classic case. He will likely need to move to first base, perhaps even while he's still in the minors, putting a ton of pressure on his admittedly prodigious bat to fully actualize. There's not much physical projection here, so the raw power Nuez currently has is pretty close to what he'll have at peak, meaning the bat-to-ball component is what will drive his stock going forward.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","","\"July 3, 2018 - STL\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 45 | Overall: 50  Nunez was known in international scouting circles because he was a standout in Cuba's youth national leagues and one of the stars of the 2016 15U World Cup in Japan, where he posted the tournament's top batting average (.667) while leading Cuba to a gold medal. Facing signing restrictions in '18 after spending heavily on international talent the year prior, the Cardinals managed to sign Nunez for $300,000 in July 2018. Subsequently assigned to the Dominican Summer League, Nunez hit .415/.497/.774 with 13 home runs and 59 RBIs in 44 games to win the circuit's triple crown.  Nunez is physically mature for his age, with a broad, thick frame that's loaded with strength. It helps him generate plus raw power that he should be able to get to in games because he's also an advanced hitter with a plus bat speed, feel for the barrel and a swing that stays in the zone for an extended period of time. He recognizes pitches and demonstrates an understanding of the strike zone, albeit with an aggressive approach. Nunez is more athletic than he appears and has the above-average arm strength needed for third base, but it might be a challenge for him to remain there on account of his below-average speed and fringe glove.  Players who are physically strong tend to excel in the Dominican Summer League, and Nunez's impressive production there should be viewed in that context. However, club officials all rave about the teenager's innate hitting ability, viewing him as someone who will continue to hit for both average and power, regardless of his defensive home.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"R\"","27","\"2018 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","5","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"33.6\"","\"52.7\"","\"49.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","30","55","40","30","55","55","60","60","30","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","40","55","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["592","589","816","1074","322","\"44.5\"","\"42.8\"","\"40.0\"","\"50.5\"","\"46.7\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Curtis\"","\"Taylor\"","2019","\"23.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1622","668954","","","\"sa917970\"","\"|\"","","\"British Columbia\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","","","\"This is another reliever who, based on usage patterns, it appears is being developed for some kind of muti-inning role, perhaps to follow the opener. Taylor was acquired from Arizona for Brad Boxberger, and after the Dbacks had taken his early-career development slowly (Taylor was a raw college arm from Canada), the Rays hit the gas pedal and quickly moved him to Montgomery in May. He thrived there, typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-90s fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders.   On paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether Taylor's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how Tampa Bay is going to use him, then this is the stuff. Taylor threw 78 innings in 38 games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings.

He throws two breaking balls, a fringy curveball and a slider that flashes above average, as well as a promising changeup. Baumann misses his share of bats, although the effort in his delivery, along with his longer arm action, does raise questions about his ultimate command profile.  Baumann's arm strength, durable frame and potential four-pitch mix will give him a chance to remain a starter, especially if he can make strides with his command and changeup.

More than anything, Martin tried to do too much when he got moved to the Minors' highest level. His swing got out of sync and he was often too quick, resulting in rolling over from being out in front too often. There is some power in the bat, power he has unlocked throughout his pro career, but it often can be his own worst enemy, as he can get pull-happy and ends up out in front. Martin does run well enough to steal some bases, though not so efficiently, and his speed gives him range to play center, though his below-average arm might be better suited to left field if he's a regular.

These doubts have been reinforced by Stubbs' semi-frequent injury issues, which led him to focus on weight gain during the offseason.   His athletic capabilities are clear though, and Stubbs is a good ball blocker, an excellent catch-and-throw guy, and his passable framing may benefit from altering the depth at which he sets up.

There has been some industry sentiment that Stubbs would be best deployed as a multi-positional bat, perhaps playing third base and the outfield corners as well as catcher.

Stubbs makes repeated contact with a simple left-handed swing and controls the strike zone better than any Astros product.

Extremely athletic for a catcher, he has average speed and knows what he's doing on the bases.  Stubbs moves well behind the plate and shows solid receiving skills.

He unofficially got his feet wet playing in the Mexican Winter League, then had a very solid first full season of pro ball in 2017, earning a promotion to the Double-A Texas League after he garnered Florida State League All-Star honors at Class A Advanced Palm Beach. Assigned to Triple-A in 2018, Arozarena struggled out of the gate and by early May was back in Double-A, where he hit .396 with seven homers in 24 games to force a promotion back to the Minors' top level.  With a quick bat and aggressive approach, Arozarena has no problems making consistent contact from the right side of the plate. The quality of his contact leaves something to be desired, though, as all too often he rolls over pitches and hits weak grounders to the left side. Becoming more selective and trying to hit to all fields could go a long way for him, but there are some that question his ability to do so given his ongoing struggles with making swift adjustments at the plate. When he does hit the ball in the air, Arozarena has shown some sneaky raw power to his pull side, and he hit all 12 of his home runs to left field in 2018.   Arozarena is an above-average runner who is aggressive on the basepaths, often to a fault. Those wheels do give him the ability to play all three spots, and the Cardinals feel he's better in center than expected. He's a cleaner fit at the corners and has the necessary arm strength for right field, which is where he saw the bulk of his playing time in 2018. If he can tone down his all-around aggressiveness and learn to make smoother adjustments, Arozarena could be ready to fill a need in the Cardinals' big league outfield should one arise in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AAA\"","19","\"2016 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.9\"","\"50.5\"","\"44.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","50","30","45","55","50","55","55","40","45","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","55","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["597","594","618","1076","236","\"44.5\"","\"43.8\"","\"40.0\"","\"51.2\"","\"48.3\"","\"51.4\"","\"|\"","\"Kyle\"","\"Cody\"","2019","\"24.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"79\"","\"245\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","1274","621129","\"cody_kyle\"","","\"sa658940\"","\"|\"","","\"Kentucky\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","40","\"jn7uVF8JLds\"","","\"Cody had a rocky career at Kentucky, always tantalizing scouts with stuff but struggling with health and control.

His Arizona rehab was successful enough for Cody to get on a mound in games for a bit, but he felt continued discomfort and needed Tommy John. The mid-summer timing of the surgery means he'll likely miss all of 2019, which means he'll be back when he's a few months shy of 26.

After he signed for $4.2 million, his stuff regressed and he fell out of favor quickly. Texas dealt him with Erik Swanson and Nick Green to get Carlos Beltran from the Yankees in the summer of 2016, and after parts of three seasons in New York's system, Tate was sent to the Orioles, along with Cody Carroll and Josh Rogers, in the 2018 Trade Deadline deal for Zack Britton.   Tate resisted incorporating some delivery changes the Rangers wanted in his first full pro season, after which his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches flattened out. Since New York allowed him to return to his college mechanics after the trade, his four-seam fastball is sitting in the low 90s and touching higher. More important has been development of Tate's two-seamer, a pitch that he throws with late sinking action that helped him generate ground balls at a 54 percent clip in 2018. His hard slider and changeup show signs of becoming above-average offerings, though both can be inconsistent, as Tate struggles to execute both pitches in the same outing.   Whether Tate will wind up as a starter or reliever is unclear. Though he throws strikes with all four of his pitches, he doesn't miss as many bats as he should with his pure stuff, which could play up in shorter stints. He has added some strength since turning pro but still has to prove his durability after missing time with hamstring issues (2016), shoulder woes (2017) and a quad injury (2018).\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","28","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (TEX)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"50.8\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2000","2500","45","45","50","","55","","","50","45","55","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","","55","","","","50","\"PHI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["599","596","507","1077","45","\"44.5\"","\"44.6\"","\"40.0\"","\"54.4\"","\"47.5\"","\"55.0\"","\"|\"","\"Luis\"","\"Rijo\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","3070","665894","","","\"sa916950\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","","\" \"","\"Part of Minnesota's return from New York for Lance Lynn, Rijo is a hyper-efficient strike thrower whose curveball moves like a Wiffle ball, seemingly floating as it approaches the plate before it begins to bend and dive away from right-handed hitters.

His ceiling will likely be limited by stuff quality -- though only 20, Rijo is physically mature and unlikely to grow into much more velocity -- but the command makes him a high-probability starter and one who could move quickly.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIN\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - NYY\"","2022","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 40  Rijo was a modest signing by the Yankees, getting $50,000 back in July 2015 to begin his pro career. He's moved incrementally, from the Dominican Summer League in 2016 to two levels of rookie ball in 2017-18. He had made one start in the short-season New York-Penn League in late July when he was included in the package sent to the Twins in return for big league veteran Lance Lynn.  A control-over-stuff right-hander, Rijo fills up the strike zone with his three-pitch mix. His fastball typically sits in the 91-92 mph range, but can reach back for 95 mph every once in a while. He throws his average curveball in the mid-70s and mixes in what will be an average changeup. He has a good feel for the pitch, but there isn't enough separation velocity-wise between it and his fastball. Pitching to contact, Rijo is efficient on the mound and can pitch deep into games as a result.  Once a bit overweight, Rijo has gotten into better shape and maintains his conditioning well.

He checks all the other beloved catcher skillset boxes: Cartaya is poised and engaged with his pitchers, he has a great arm, he looks built to meet the position's physical demands, and makes an attempt to frame pitches when he can. There's a chance he outgrows the position but he's deceptively athletic for his size, and we'd call it unlikely. There's not as much room for power projection here as there is for most others this age, but there's enough to profile at catcher. Cartaya's approach is geared for well-timed, pull-side gap contact.

He draws repeated Salvador Perez comparisons and like the perennial All-Star and Gold Glover, Cartaya may be advanced enough to make his U.S. debut at 17.  Though he's taller than most catchers, Cartaya is agile and moves well behind the plate. He already shows advanced receiving ability for a teenager and should fit in well in an organization that prioritizes framing skills. He also has a strong arm and makes accurate throws.  Cartaya's feel for barrel and the strike zone stands out for such a young player.

The changeup has the best movement but Cabrera struggles to set it up because he can't locate his fastball consistently. His slider is short and cuttery, the curveball has depth but lacks bite.

He reached Double-A for the first time as a 20-year-old in '17, following a strong showing in the Florida State League, and he was having a solid campaign in his return to the Southern League when the Cardinals acquired him as part of the Tommy Pham deal at the 2018 non-waiver Trade Deadline. After finishing the season in Triple-A, Cabrera dominated as a reliever in the Dominican Winter League, posting a 0.63 WHIP with 21 strikeouts in 14 1/3 innings for Tigres del Licey.  Cabrera has added strength to his wiry frame and had his stuff tick up as a result. The left-hander generates easy velocity with his quick arm, sitting in the mid 90s and bumping 98 mph with his fastball. His slider registers in the upper 80s, thrown with late, short slicing action that gives it a cutter-like feel at times, and he also throws a changeup that is effective against right-handed hitters. His curveball is below average and represents a distant fourth pitch. Though his stuff can be electric, Cabrera struggles to throw strikes at times because he has a violent delivery that makes his over-the-top arm slot difficult to repeat.  Whether Cabrera can refine his delivery enough to improve his control -- 4.6 BB/9 in 2018; 3.7 BB/9 in his career -- will determine if he remains a starter. The Cardinals will continue to develop him in that role, but as a lefty with a big fastball and a swing-and-miss breaking ball, Cabrera's appeal as a potential bullpen asset is undeniable.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"MLB\"","13","\"2013 J2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","8","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.7\"","\"46.4\"","\"42.9\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2225","2375","40","60","50","45","45","","","40","60","55","45","45","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","50","45","55","","","","40","\"LAN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["602","599","815","710","952","\"44.4\"","\"42.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"46.5\"","\"41.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","\"Andrew\"","\"Schultz\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2943","","\"schultz_andrew\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Tennessee\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","\"Reliever has hit 101 mph this spring after dramatically reducing the length in his arm stroke, but offers little else currently.\"","\"Reliever has hit 101 mph this spring after dramatically reducing the length in his arm stroke, but offers little else currently.\"","\"|\"","\"Tennessee\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-andrew-schultz-rhp\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 55 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Schultz pumped his fastball up to 97 mph as a Georgia high school senior in 2016, but concerns about his delivery, wildness and signability left him undrafted.

After shortening his arm angle and raising his slot a bit in 2019, he has thrown consistently harder than any college pitcher available in the Draft.  Schultz has sat at 95-97 mph and hit 101 with his fastball multiple times as a junior. His heater not only features premium velocity but also high spin rates, giving it riding action up in the strike zone. His slider has more power than bite, reaching the upper 80s and showing flashes of becoming a plus pitch at times yet also playing as a below-average slurve in the low 80s at others.  A pure reliever, Schultz doesn't have a third pitch, still has effort in his delivery and still battles the strike zone on a regular basis.

The results have been up-and-down, but the Braves are still bullish on his stuff.  De La Cruz has a live arm with a fastball up to 95-96 mph, a slider that flashes plus and misses bats and some feel for a changeup. What he hasn't shown to date is an ability to command his pitches or sequence them consistently. He falls in love with his fastball too much, thinking he can blow it by any hitter he faces. He needs to learn to trust his secondary stuff more, which in turn will help his fastball play up. That, plus dialing down his fastball a tick or two in order to achieve more consistent command, will help make him a more complete pitcher.  De La Cruz has a long way to go in order to reach his ceiling. He's yet to surpass the 100-innings plateau in a season and needs those innings to take the next step in his development.

His repertoire depth is a significant part of why he's likely to be successful in the big leagues. Both his heavily-used slider and curveball are of big league quality and can miss bats when located, and Festa has a serviceable changeup.

Seattle drafted both arms, getting Miller in the sixth round and signing Festa for a money-saving $10,000 in the seventh. Miller was traded to the Marlins in July 2017 and has yet to get out of A ball. Festa, meanwhile, transitioned to the bullpen and made his big league debut in 2018.  Festa spent some time starting during his pro debut in the summer of 2016, but it was his full-time move to a relief role that allowed him to take off. The right-hander has missed bats at a 11.3 K/9 clip in the Minor Leagues thanks largely to his two above-average pitches in his fastball and slider. The heater sits at 92-95 mph, and his slider has good late break to it. Both played up in short relief, allowing him to lead the organization with 20 saves in 2018. He does have a curve and a changeup he mixes in to give hitters different looks.  Festa and his slider were a bit of an unknown when he got to the big leagues and the key to his success will be how well he adjusts when Major League batters adjust to him.

The Twins didn't get the best look at Alcala after the trade, as the right-hander was a little dinged up and fatigued at season's end, so they are excited to see him at full strength. Alcala has watched his velocity climb as he's progressed and is now up in the 95-98 mph range consistently with good life. His secondary stuff has gotten better, and he missed more bats in 2018, though he's still working on their refinement. His slider and curve are both power breaking balls that run into each other at times and his changeup does get too firm.  More than anything, it will be Alcala's command that determines his ultimate role.

His BB/K ratio was fine in college, but his BABIP was very low, due in part to weaker contact and a slow first step out of the box, but also some bad luck. He's progressed offensively in pro ball and his power has finally begun to show up in the stat line.   He's fringy in center field and now has a textbook fourth outfielder profile.

He struggled to hit for much of his first two-plus years as a pro and really scuffled with a move to Double-A to start the 2018 season. Bolt went back down to the California League, righted himself, then played his way on to the 40-man roster with a huge finish to the year, back in Double-A and a stint in the Arizona Fall League.  The A's always felt Bolt had the ability to succeed, but just hadn't been able to find the level of consistency to tap into his tools. He can hit for average and power from both sides of the plate, though the power really shows up left-handed (17 of his 19 homers in 2018 came from that side). He has enough speed to steal a base, and he finished just one home run and one steal shy of a 20-20 campaign last year.

His career game log is freckled with clusters of two and three-inning rehab outings amid multiple shoulder and elbow ailments of varying severity. In 2018, Harvey injured his shoulder dodging a foul ball in the dugout, then was shut down in August with elbow discomfort as he tried to rehab back from the shoulder issue. Somehow, Harvey's stuff is still excellent. His fastball/curveball pairing is standard late-inning fare and because Harvey is out of options, he's very likely to be fast tracked into a relief role immediately in the spring to give him a better shot at having big league success right away. It also means he has almost no trade value right now because teams know there's a chance he could soon be available on waivers.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2013, 1st (22) - BAL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  The Orioles' first-round pick in 2013, Harvey showed immense promise the next year during his full-season debut, which included a Futures Game selection at age 19. However, injuries have since derailed Harvey's progress, limiting the right-hander to just 63 2/3 total innings since 2015. Elbow issues cost him part of 2014 and all of '15 before he ultimately required Tommy John surgery in June '16. When he returned to the mound in July 2017, Harvey looked like his old self while making eight starts across three levels, and the Orioles added him to their 40-man roster after the season. And while an impressive showing in Spring Training offered hope that 2018 might be the year Harvey stayed healthy and puts it all together, he made just eight starts at Double-A Bowie before a sore shoulder landed him on the disabled list in June, effectively ending his season.   Harvey continues to show dynamic stuff in the rare instances he's healthy. His fastball will sit in the 92-95 mph range and reaches 96-97, thrown with good angle from a relatively smooth delivery. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball that he throws with tight spin and considerable depth to create late downward action. Harvey's changeup gives him another quality offering, though his time on the shelf has impacted its development.  Harvey has No. 3-starter upside based on his raw stuff, though it will be difficult for him to reach his ceiling (or anything close to it) if he can't stay on the field. Entering his age-24 season in 2019, Harvey's clearest path to the Majors likely is as a reliever, and there's little doubt that he could be effective in a late-inning role with his two plus pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"AA\"","25","\"2013 Draft Rnd 1 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","12","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2150","2200","40","60","45","60","","","","45","60","45","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","60","","","","","45","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["609","606","599","714","613","\"44.4\"","\"43.9\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.7\"","\"48.2\"","\"48.8\"","\"|\"","\"Daniel\"","\"Ponce de Leon\"","2019","\"27.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","3025","594965","","16110","\"sa549749\"","\"|\"","","\"Embry-Riddle\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\" \"","","\"The city-appropriate, 180 degree arch created by the letters on the back of Poncedeleon's jersey accentuates his gawky, rectangular frame, which is so thin that it looks two-dimensional.

He had already reached Triple-A in 2017 and was making his sixth career start at the level when he took a line drive off of his head and required emergency surgery to stop the bleeding in his brain. After a long layoff that included an extensive rehab process, Poncedeleon was cleared to return for Spring Training in 2018 and opened the season back in Triple-A. His success in the Pacific Coast League earned him his first callup to St. Louis at age 26 in July, and Poncedeleon tied a bow on his miraculous comeback story by tossing seven no-hit innings against the Reds in his big league debut.   Poncedeleon's continued success throughout his career is a testimony to his stuff. He's consistently around the zone with a sinking fastball that touches the mid-90s and sits at 93-94 mph, while his above-average 90-91 mph cutter and average changeup are weapons for him against right- and left-handed hitters, respectively. He also has an upper-70s curveball at his disposal, but it's a below-average pitch, and he seldom threw it in the big leagues.   After his tremendous debut in July, Poncedeleon went on to toss 33 innings for the Cardinals, posting a 2.73 ERA across 11 outings (four starts). While he's been a very capable starter in his career, Poncedeleon may offer the most value in the same type of swingman role he thrived in last year.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"MLB\"","25","\"2014 Draft Rnd 9 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"50.0\"","\"50.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2600","50","50","45","55","","50","","50","50","50","55","","50","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","45","","50","","","45","","",""],["610","607","600","715","595","\"44.4\"","\"43.9\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.8\"","\"46.4\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Carlos\"","\"Hernandez\"","2019","\"22.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2582","672578","","","\"sa3004199\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","","\"Hernandez is a high-probability fifth starter/middle reliever depending on how his breaking ball develops.

Hernandez has the ceiling right, but he signed at age 19 and received just $15,000 to sign in July 2016 out of Venezuela. His 2017 pro debut in the Appalachian League was up-and-down, but he started showing why the Royals are excited about him with a move to full-season ball in 2018, though his season was delayed by a death in the family early and cut short by some fatigue at the end of the summer.  Projectable at 6-foot-4, Hernandez is still growing into his body and his fastball. He easily sits around 94 mph and touches 97 mph regularly, with many feeling he could be sitting in the 96- to 97-mph range at some point in the future. At its best, the right-hander's curve is better than his changeup, though the latter is more consistent. With his long levers, it's hard for him to repeat his mechanics on his breaking ball, but it has the potential to be a plus pitch. He's showing an increasing ability to land all three pitches for strikes.  Hernandez's fatigue at the end of the year led to some minor arm issues, but those mostly stemmed from him not being physically prepared for a long season.

He has spent his entire career in the Bulldogs' weekend rotation and has gotten better throughout his three years in Indianapolis.    Pepiot has one of the best changeups in the college ranks, a low-80s offering with fade that he sells with deceptive arm speed. He can reach 96 mph with some riding action on his fastball, which usually parks around 91-94. Both his curveball and slider can be solid pitches at their best but lack consistency.    Pepiot has a strong, durable frame that should allow him to hold up as a starter.

After the A's packaged him to Milwaukee that offseason in the Khris Davis deal, Nottingham spent the next two seasons in Double-A, struggling to make an impact on either side of the ball. Advancing to Triple-A in 2018, Nottingham finally made the all-around improvements the Brewers had long hoped he might. It earned him his first big league callup in April, and he joined the club again for stretches in July and September. He might have taken on a larger role with the Brewers had he not suffered a chip fracture in his right wrist via a foul tip at the outset of August.   After back-to-back disappointing Double-A campaigns in 2016-17 -- during which he produced a .223 average and 20 home runs in 213 games -- Nottingham's bat finally came alive last season at Triple-A, where he hit .281 with 10 homers in 50 games. Improved plate discipline and significantly less swing-and-miss helped fuel the turnaround, as did the fact that Nottingham hit the ball in the air more consistently than at any other point in his career. That evolution in his batted-ball profile, along with his improved feel for the zone, inspires hope in club officials that Nottingham might be on the cusp of earnestly tapping into his plus raw power.   Even during his deepest struggles at the plate in Double-A, Nottingham relentlessly put in the hard work needed to improve his defense. The results showed in 2017 in the form of a 40 percent caught-stealing rate, and club officials are quick to note the significant gains he's made with his blocking. Overall, Nottingham has the profile of a potential big league backup who could still emerge as an everyday player if his power comes out.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"40.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","45","30","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"BOS\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["613","610","504","457","575","\"44.4\"","\"44.6\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.9\"","\"42.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"|\"","\"Davis\"","\"Wendzel\"","2019","\"22.0\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","325","8","\"|\"","2851","","\"wendzel_davis\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Baylor\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","\"Wendzel was an eligible sophomore last year but should go much better this year after a loud spring.

Wendzel is fearless at the plate, willing to work deep counts while he hunts for a pitch to hit and taking walks when he doesn't get one. The Big 12 Conference co-player of the year, he stays inside the ball well with his right-handed swing and uses the entire field. He tends to drive the ball to the gaps and could tap into more of his solid strength and raw power once he turns on more pitches.    A well below-average runner when he got to Baylor, Wendzel has worked hard to develop close to average speed out of the batter's box and plays quicker than that with good instincts on the bases.

Lindsay also hasn't shown much bat control at any point in his career, so his path to success (after staying healthy) is as a lower average hitter with some power playing a solid average center field.

Lindsay's hamstring problems persisted that summer and into 2016, limiting the talented outfielder to 236 at-bats over two summers. When his legs were finally healthy in 2017, an elbow injury ended Lindsay's season in July and required ulnar nerve transposition surgery. A flare-up in his elbow in '18 led to another trip to the DL, but he came back strong and impressed in the Arizona Fall League, showing some newfound power as part of his across-the-board tools.   In the AFL, Lindsay consistently achieved a better point of contact with his swing, with bat speed and extension that allowed him to tap into his plus raw power. After homering three times in 360 plate appearances during the regular season, Lindsay needed only 31 PAs to match that total in the Fall League. That ability to consistently impact the ball has been absent for much of Lindsay's career, and the hope is that it will unlock his potential as someone who hits for both average and power. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies.   Lindsay still runs well, despite the leg issues, and while he's largely been hesitant on the basepaths because of the injuries, he should get the green light more moving forward provided he stays healthy. His plus speed allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field, where his average arm strength is a fit. Evaluators who have seen Lindsay at his best are quick to note that his production as a pro does not reflect his tools and potential.

He's one of only four players to earn Under Armour All-America honors in baseball and football, joining Kyler Murray, A.J. Brown and Maurice Hampton (another top prep prospect in this class). He has committed to play both sports at Mississippi, and his multisport talents give him added leverage but also cloud his signability -- as does a disappointing spring at the plate.    Ealy needs to smooth out his right-handed stroke and has had trouble making quality contact against Mississippi high school pitching as a senior. He also had swing-and-miss issues on the showcase circuit last summer. He has impressive bat speed and packs plenty of strength in his compact frame, giving him at least 20-homer upside if he puts it all together at the plate.    Ealy can flash top-of-the-scale run times and already shows a knack for stealing bases. His quickness allows him to chase down balls in both gaps from center field, though his reads and routes need more work, and his strong arm will play anywhere in the outfield.

In college, Hatch's two main pitches were a low-90s two-seam fastball and a low-80s slider. The Cubs wanted him to focus on using a four-seamer and changeup to combat left-handers, but he took that too far in 2018 and got hit when he relied too much on the straighter of his two fastballs. On the positive side, his changeup was his best offering at times last year, and he showed the ability to sit at 93-94 mph and touch 96 with his four-seamer.  Hatch also has had difficulty avoiding barrels because his control has been spotty. He pounded the strike zone when he was the Big 12 Conference pitcher of the year in 2016 but finished second in the Double-A Southern League with 61 walks a year ago.

He started a rehab assignemnt in mid-July and made his major league debut in September, his stuff mostly back to pre-TJ form. He topped out at 98 and broke off plenty of nasty sliders, but his command and the quality of break on the slider were inconsistent, which is typical of those returning from TJ. Burdi's delivery is odd. His swivels about an axis created by a stiff front leg. It makes it hard for him to get over his front side and is difficult to repeat. This, combined with his injury history, mean he's perceived as a risk for chronic health issues.   If he can stay healthy, he could pitch at the back of a bullpen. Rule 5 roster requirements state that a drafted player needs to be on his new team's big league roster for 90 days for his new club to keep him, which means Burdi needs to stay with the Pirates through April and May or else be offered back to the Twins.\"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","\"2014, 2nd (46) - MIN\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Slider: 65 | Changeup: 40 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Selecting players in the Rule 5 Draft is always a roll of the dice. The Pirates knew they were really gambling when they acquired Burdi via a trade with the Phillies, who had taken the reliever in the 2017 edition of the Draft. The former Louisville standout had been a second-round pick of the Twins in 2014, but missed most of '16 with an elbow bone bruise and then was shelved for all of '17 following Tommy John surgery. He did get through the rehab process and made his big league debut last September.  At his best, Burdi displayed the kind of power repertoire that plays well in the back end of a bullpen. He's capable of sitting easily in the upper-90s with his fastball and has hit triple digits. His plus slider is nasty and misses a ton of bats, a big reason why he's struck out 12.2 per nine innings in his Minor League career. He will show a changeup against lefties, though he's really just a two-pitch power reliever. Command was never a strength for the right-hander and, not surprisingly, he struggled with his feel upon his return.  He'll need to stay on the active roster for 90 days, based on Rule 5 rules, so Burdi will have to stick with the Pirates or get offered back to the Twins. The organization thinks after a real, non-rehabbing offseason, he can get back to showing the stuff that made him an intriguing prospect in the first place.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PIT\"","\"MLB\"","30","\"2014 Draft Rnd 2 (MIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.0\"","\"48.0\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2480","2470","40","60","","","55","","","40","60","","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","80","40","","65","","","","40","\"COL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["619","616","666","705","647","\"44.3\"","\"43.5\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.5\"","\"42.6\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Telmito\"","\"Agustin\"","2019","\"22.6\"","\"LF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"70\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1846","648739","","","\"sa828321\"","\"|\"","","\"U.S. Virgin Islands\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","","","\"The last time one of us wrote up Agustin he was a skinny, all-fields line drive tweener who looked like a classic bench outfielder.

He was overmatched at Class A Advanced Potomac the next year but showed more power and consistency after a demotion to Class A Hagerstown. Taking another crack at Potomac in 2018, Agustin was hitting .386/.411/.659 in the Carolina League before a broken finger suffered in early May disrupted his breakout campaign.   Once viewed as a slap hitter with minimal impact potential at the plate, Agustin has since tacked on considerable muscle to his frame. With that improved strength has come a more leveraged swing and an emphasis on driving the ball in the air, something he did nearly 10 percent better last season than 2017. What's more, Agustin was able to make those adjustments while making gains in his approach and improving his strikeout and walk rates.   A plus runner who played mostly center field early in his career, Agustin has wheels that now grade out more as above-average, and he's settled in as an average defender who can handle either right or left field.

He was touching the upper 90s at times over the summer and has been up to 99 mph more consistently this spring as he's given up trying to hit. His power breaking ball has been buckling knees this spring and could give him a nasty two plus pitch combination in shorter stints, though he does have a changeup that he can use at times against left-handed hitters.

With broad, tapered shoulders and a sizable lower half, he body comps to Jonathan Schoop and like Schoop, he projects to move off of shortstop at some point. His size prohibits projection at the position on its own, and Marte's hands were also inconsistent as an amateur; some international scouts thought he might move to the outfield.   But Marte has the thunderous, pull-side power to profile just about anywhere, especially if he can stay on the dirt. He should end up with plus raw power at peak, perhaps more. He has a long, slow leg kick that doesn't add much to his swing efficacy right now, as most of Marte's power comes from pure hand speed and strength, but that will likely improve with reps.

The Dominican teenager came to Arizona in the fall to participate in the organization's high performance camp, rather than play in instructional league games, so he'll be making his professional debut in 2019.  Two things stood out for the Mariners with Marte from the get-go: his bat speed and his footspeed. He has work to do on his approach, nothing new given his age and experience level, but he's already been making an effort in that regard and will just have to start applying it as he begins his career in earnest. He should have the ability to hit for average and the leverage in his swing points to plenty of power as well. Marte can really run too, with some seeing 80 run times on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. There are some good defensive tools to work with, though at first his actions weren't in sync, with his feet ahead of his hands. He's already shown more maturity in approaching ground balls and keeping his feet under him, giving more confidence he can stay on the dirt with his strong arm.  Whether that's at shortstop remains to be seen, as it's hard to know exactly how his body will continue to mature.

Howard and Dunshee have similarities beyond beyond being shrewd senior signs. Both right-handers use a bevy of largely average offerings and the ability to command them to succeed. While Howard doesn't miss quite as many bats as his rotation-mate, he does have a healthy strikeout rate and gets more ground-ball outs thanks in part to the good sink on his 89-92 mph fastball that plays as average due to its movement. His best secondary pitch is an 89 mph cutter that misses bats and gets more weak contact on the ground. Howard can morph his cutter into a slightly slower slider that flashes plus, and he mixes in an effective curve and changeup as well.   Howard uses his 6-foot-9 frame extremely well with outstanding extension to create uncomfortable at-bats, a big reason why he has a high pop-up rate in addition to his ground-ball tendencies.

The secondary stuff for high-leverage duty probably isn't here, and we have Bautista projected as a middle reliever.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","","\"April 1, 2013 - BOS\"","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 40 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  Signed back in April 2013 by the Red Sox, Bautista spent his first two summers starting, but given his power repertoire and shaky command, the move to a relief role in 2016 surprised no one. He missed bats, and walked hitters, at a high rate in Boston's system until July 2017, when he was one of three Minor League relievers sent to the Mets in the Addison Reed deal. The Mets added him to the 40-man roster that offseason and watched him make his big league debut in 2018, though he was often hit in the Minors. The Mariners decided to roll the dice on his arm strength and acquired him as part of the package in the Robinson Cano trade last December.  Even as an amateur, Bautista looked like the type who would have pure, loose and easy velocity. And that's what he shows with a fastball that often sits 98-99 mph and hits triple digits at times. At its best, it has excellent life to it, but as Bautista threw hard, his delivery opened up more and his fastball straightened out. He learned that good hitters can hit 100 mph when it's straight. He also has to manage his power slider, which flashes plus, for it to be a more consistent out pitch. His changeup is fringy at best.  Bautista has always struggled with command, but he doesn't need pinpoint control to pitch in a big league bullpen. His velocity may have gotten him to the big leagues, but now he has to show he can pitch enough to stay there.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"MLB\"","21","\"2012 J2 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"42.5\"","\"|\"","1.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2250","40","70","45","","50","","","40","70","45","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","40","","55","","","","40","","",""],["626","623","726","693","882","\"44.2\"","\"43.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"47.0\"","\"44.8\"","\"47.2\"","\"|\"","\"Grant\"","\"Holmes\"","2019","\"23.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"224\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","753","656550","\"holmes_grant\"","","\"sa828669\"","\"|\"","","\"Conway HS (SC)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","40","\"MvTNMZd4LDA\"","","\"Wire-to-wire shoulder issues kept Holmes off the field for nearly all of the 2018 regular season. He was limited to fastball/changeup-only bullpens in the spring but didn't really got going until late in the summer, when he made two starts in August and showed stuff that was slightly beneath where he was earlier in his career, with his fastball residing in the 92-94 range. Poised to pick up innings in the Arizona Fall League, Holmes once again had shoulder discomfort and was shut down for the year. The A's still felt compelled to add him to the 40-man this offseason rather than let another team take a $100,000 flier on him in the Rule 5 and hope his fastball/slider combination stuck in their bullpen.   At his absolute best, Holmes will sit 93-96 with a plus slider and average-flashing changeup, a No. 4 or 5 starter if his change and command improve. Of this triumvirate of injured arms, Holmes is the most likely to be a reliever, but his injury history is the least lengthy. He was on the same bullpen schedule as Jesus Luzardo early in camp but still hasn't pitched in a spring training game.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2014, 1st (22) - LAD\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Cutter: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Taken by the Dodgers with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 Draft, Holmes got an above slot bonus of $2.5 million to sign rather than head from his South Carolina high school to the University of Florida. He was in his second full season of pro ball when he was sent to the A's in the trade that brought Rich Hill and Josh Reddick at the 2016 Trade Deadline. His first full year with his new organization was up-and-down and his second, 2018, never got off the ground as he missed nearly all of it with a right rotator cuff injury.  The A's are keeping their collective fingers crossed that he's put the shoulder ailment behind him and all signs are pointing in the right direction. He's worked very hard to be ready to go and get his stuff back to where it was. He throws his heavy 93-94 mph fastball with excellent movement, leading to high GO/AO rates every year. He misses bats with his plus breaking ball, a hard power curve with depth, and he can mix in an average changeup. Holmes would sometimes throw a four-seamer with cutting action, so he just went with it and has developed an above-average cutter, that has late cut and comes in hard at 90-91 mph. He's never been a big command guy and he will have to throw more strikes to stay in a rotation.  More than anything, Holmes needs to show he can answer the bell every fifth day and see how he responds.

The A's went a bit over the $100,000 threshold for picks after the 10th round, signing him for $125K in the 14th round of last June's Draft. Varland then pitched his way to full-season ball in his relatively brief pro debut.  Varland cranked his fastball up to 95-96 mph at times at Concordia, but largely pitched at 92 mph during his summer debut in the A's organization. He can fill up the strike zone with his heater and get swings and misses with it. He also misses bats with his slider, while he also was able to use the breaking ball and his changeup to get some ground-ball outs. While he has an up-tempo delivery, he's always been a strike-thrower and continued that trend in his first taste of pro ball.  He'll need to find a way to attack left-handed hitters, who hit him a bit better last summer, albeit in a small sample size, and refinement of the changeup could do that. He's reminded some of Sonny Gray in terms of his aggressive demeanor on the mound and body type (though not in pure stuff), with a realistic ceiling as a back-end starter and a life as a reliever more likely.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"A+\"","27","\"2018 Draft Rnd 14 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.2\"","\"51.7\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2450","2350","40","50","","45","50","","","50","55","","50","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","","50","","","","55","","",""],["628","625","706","694","829","\"44.2\"","\"43.3\"","\"41.4\"","\"47.4\"","\"44.5\"","\"47.7\"","\"|\"","\"Tony\"","\"Dibrell\"","2019","\"23.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2139","675914","\"dibrell_tony\"","","\"sa3004657\"","\"|\"","","\"Kennesaw State\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","\"1hU6tXiaax0\"","","\"Dibrell looked like a second round talent at times in college but his velocity and command varied pretty wildly during his draft year at Kennesaw State, and he fell to the fourth round.

The Mets made him their fourth-round pick in June, and Dibrell received a slightly-above-pick-value bonus to sign. Pitching in relief in the short-season New York-Penn League during his debut, Dibrell struck out 12.8 per nine innings, then followed it up with a solid first full year in the South Atlantic League, tying for the circuit lead in strikeouts (147) while fanning better than 10 per nine.   A projectable right-hander with a strong frame and quick arm, Dibrell can run his fastball up to 96 mph and sits at 91-93. While his heater doesn't have much in the way of late movement, it consistently plays above its velocity with riding life, created by Dibrell's extension over his front side. His best secondary pitch is a low-80s slider that has late action, and he also has feel for executing a changeup that could be above average once developed. Dibrell rounds out his four-pitch mix with a mid-70s curveball that has big break.   Dibrell proved durable and effective over his first full season, finishing with 131 innings pitched. His fastball, slider and changeup can all flash plus potential at their best, so he has the ingredients to start, with realistic No. 5-starter potential and a chance to achieve more. But after issuing 3.7 walks per nine innings against younger hitters in Class A, Dibrell will have to continue to refine his overall control and command to reach his ceiling, and there are some that worry about his low margin for error as a strikeout pitcher who largely generates fly-ball contact.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"A+\"","20","\"2017 Draft Rnd 4 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.3\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2100","2250","40","50","50","45","45","","","45","50","55","50","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","50","55","","","","45","","",""],["629","626","690","695","806","\"44.2\"","\"43.4\"","\"41.4\"","\"47.5\"","\"45.0\"","\"47.8\"","\"|\"","\"Troy\"","\"Stokes Jr.\"","2019","\"23.3\"","\"LF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"68\"","\"182\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2359","657011","","","\"sa828871\"","\"|\"","","\"Calvert Hall HS (MD)\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"DX1Bu8kW3W8\"","","\"Stokes is Diet Khris Davis. He's limited to LF/DH duties because of nearly unplayable arm strength, and he's able to hit for in-game power despite blatant swing-and-miss issues due to his ability to consistently hit the ball in the air. Stokes' extreme, pull-only approach to contact makes him vulnerable to breaking stuff down and away from him, and he is going to swing and miss at an above-average clip. But he's also adept at identifying balls and strikes. There is some precedent for this type of offensive profile (low batting average, above-average OBP, and power) working in left field. It looks like Kyle Schwarber--though Stokes doesn't have that kind of raw pop--or late-career Curtis Granderson. Stokes runs well enough that he could be an above-average defender in left field but he might also give back significant value there becauase of his throwing issues. He's an odd one who we think fits as the smaller half of a corner outfield platoon and pinch runner. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2014, 4th (116) - MIL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 40 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  The Brewers selected Stokes in the fourth round of the 2014 Draft out of the Maryland prep ranks and lured him away from his Terps commitment with a $400,000 bonus. He made his full-season debut two years later, flashing a promising blend of power and speed at Class A Wisconsin, then broke out in earnest at age 21 in 2017 by hitting 20 home runs and swiping 31 bags while reaching Double-A. Spending all of 2018 in the Southern League, Stokes nearly posted his second straight 20-20 campaign before finishing with 19 homers and steals apiece. After the season, the Brewers added Stokes to their 40-man roster.   Stokes confirmed in 2018 that his power output from the previous year was anything but a fluke. He's undersized but also very strong, with a quick bat and uppercut barrel path that is conducive to hitting the ball in the air. He sells out for power, employing an aggressive, extreme-pull approach that leads to a lot of swing-and-miss and raises questions about his hit-tool utility. The good news is that Stokes' strong on-base skills -- he's posted at least a .340 OBP in each of his three full-season campaigns -- should help to mitigate concerns about his bat, as he's long demonstrated a discerning eye while drawing walks at a healthy clip.   An above-average runner, Stokes knows how to apply his wheels on the basepaths and improved as a basestealer in 2018. A well-below-average arm will limit him to a career in left field, but he's generally regarded as an above-average defender at the position and was the Minor League Gold Glove-winner there in 2018. Overall, he has the profile of a semi-regular or platoon player, perhaps more so if he can start converting some of the strikeouts into contact.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AAA\"","13","\"2014 Draft Rnd 4 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","45","55","55","50","30","40","50","55","55","55","30","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","50","55","40","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["630","627","691","696","737","\"44.2\"","\"43.4\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.0\"","\"44.0\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Antoine\"","\"Kelly\"","2019","\"19.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"77\"","\"185\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2887","","\"kelly_antoine\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Wabash Valley JC (IL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","\"Kelly was a Padres draftee last year and his velo spike this spring, hitting 97.

He chose instead to attend Wabash Valley (Ill.) CC, where he led national juco pitchers with 19.1 strikeouts per nine innings. He may have the biggest gap between his ceiling and floor of any player in the Draft.  His fastball topped out in the low 90s as a high school senior, but after adding 20 pounds and cleaning up his delivery, Kelly is reaching 98 mph and showing the ability to work at 94-97 mph for innings at a time. Scouts look at his 6-foot-6 frame and how easy and loose his arm looks while pumping mid-90s heat, and many of them come up with same physical comparison: a young David Price. He still has room to add more strength and to further improve his mechanics, so it's easy to project him topping 100 mph in the future.  Kelly lacks a usable second pitch because he hasn't shown much aptitude for spinning the ball -- his mid-80s slider is below average -- and his changeup is non-existent. His control also needs a major upgrade and his mound presence concerns scouts as well.

His stiff, long arm action significantly inhibits Perez's ability to throw strikes and he unanimously projects into a bullpen. But because he has three plus pitches (and we have the fastball projected as a 70 out of the bullpen), he could be a dominant late or multi-inning arm.

He came straight to the United States for his 2015 pro debut and earned rapid promotions in each of his first three pro seasons. His control lapsed in 2017, but he still recorded a 3.44 ERA at two Class A stops because he was able to overpower hitters. He reached Double-A for the first time in July 2018, only to then be dealt to the Blue Jays later in the month with Ken Giles and David Paulino in exchange for Robert Osuna.  There never have been questions about Perez's raw stuff and effectiveness. His ability to throw strikes, on the other hand, is suspect. The right-hander has four pitches that can grade as plus or better at their best. He can beat hitters with his fastball, throwing a 93-99 mph two-seamer with nice sink and a four-seamer with explosive riding life. He also can snap off wipeout breaking stuff, though there are times when he can't find the strike zone with his slider or curveball. He uses a splitter in lieu of a changeup, and it too can elicit swings and misses or entirely miss the plate. Timing issues have prevented Perez from throwing consistent strikes in his career, but he's athletic enough that gains in his control and command should be possible.   Opponents struggle to make solid contact against Perez, who posted a 15 percent swinging-strike rate, averaged 10.4 strikeouts-per-nine and held hitters to a .196 average in 2018. His walk rate, on the other hand, has fluctuated from 4.5 BB/9 in his first two seasons to 6.5 in his third to 5.0 in 2018. The fact that Perez has managed a career ERA of 3.20 in spite of his well-below-average control is testimony to his electric stuff and a sign that he'll probably end up in the bullpen, where he could become a dominant late-inning weapon.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AA\"","13","\"2014 J2 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"40.7\"","\"50.7\"","\"44.3\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2500","30","60","","45","50","","40","40","70","","50","60","","55","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","","55","55","","50","","40","\"CHA\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["632","629","664","698","594","\"44.2\"","\"43.5\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.8\"","\"40.4\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Ryder\"","\"Green\"","2019","\"19.1\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2456","680685","\"green_ryder\"","","\"sa3007875\"","\"|\"","","\"Karns HS (TN)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","\"0zwCZ6knA-s\"","","\"It was widely believed that the Yankees would use their 2018 second or third round pick on an over slot high schooler with a strong college commitment, perhaps someone a bit under the radar, like Adam Hackenberg or Max Marusak. It turned out to be Green, who was signed away from a Vanderbilt commitment for just shy of $1 million. Green ended up transferring to new high schools after his family had issues with the coaching staff in his original district -- issues that ultimately led to a dropped lawsuit and then a countersuit for defamation. But he was an early Vanderbilt commit, scouts knew who he was, and it didn't affect the way he was scouted. He really broke out at the 2017 Area Code games, when he took one of the most impressive BPs there and had among the best outfield arms. He hit several balls hard during the week but was clearly raw from a bat-to-ball standpoint, and many scouts thought he'd end up going to college because apprehension over his hit tool would prevent teams from paying him enough to go pro. Green didn't face a lot of good pitching while he was in high school and his breaking ball recognition is immature.

His commitment to Vanderbilt gave him added leverage in the 2018 Draft, with the Yankees paying him an above-slot $997,500 bonus in the third round. He fits the classic right-field profile but may take a while to develop after striking out at a 37 percent rate in his debut.  Green has obvious bat speed and strength that create above-average raw power from the right side of the plate. He has a decent understanding of the strike zone but can lapse into selling out for home runs instead of letting them come naturally. When he did make contact in his first taste of pro ball, much of it came on rolled-over grounders to the left side of the infield.  More than a one-dimensional slugger, Green shows average speed out of the batter's box and is a solid runner once underway.

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. Velo is a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that start shot him up the board, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. The velo spike held in pro ball: German sat 92-95 and hit 97 mph in fall instructional league and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing. The upside is a bit limited, as his slider and changeup still just flash average at best, but the Yankees are changing German's slurvy college breaking ball into more of a true slider and pushing him to throw his changeup more, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the future pitch grades move north as he continues to mature as a pitcher.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","\"2018, 4th (127) - NYY\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  German ranked fifth in NCAA Division I in ERA (1.58) and sixth in WHIP (0.83) as a junior at North Florida last spring, becoming the highest-drafted pitcher in Ospreys history when the Yankees took him in the fourth round. He lived up to his reputation for advanced pitchability after signing for a below-slot $347,500 and also opened eyes when his fastball jumped about three mph in his first pro summer.  One of several New York pitching prospects who are throwing harder as pros than they did as collegians, German worked at 90-95 mph for North Florida and sat at 94-98 in his debut. Even at lower velocities, his heater was effective because he commands it well to both sides of the plate. He also throws a hard curveball with tight break and has some feel for a changeup, though both of his secondary pitches usually grade as average.  With his strong build and a sound delivery that he repeats well, German should have the durability and pitch efficiency needed for a starter. To stay in that role, he'll probably need to improve either his curveball or changeup to give him a solid second offering. His floor as a back-of-the-rotation option appealed to the Yankees when they drafted him and now his ceiling is more appealing.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A+\"","33","\"2018 Draft Rnd 4 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","21","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"42.5\"","\"51.7\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2400","40","55","40","","40","","","50","60","50","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","50","","","","","45","","",""],["634","631","615","700","542","\"44.2\"","\"43.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.1\"","\"44.0\"","\"49.6\"","\"|\"","\"Travis\"","\"MacGregor\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1630","669740","","","\"sa917950\"","\"|\"","","\"East Lake HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","","\"One of two East Lake high school pitchers who were drafted in 2016 (the Mets' Christian James is the other), things were starting to come together for MacGregor before he blew out and needed Tommy John in September.

He missed five weeks, then returned to Low-A West Virginia and pitched well until late-August when he was again shut down. He'll likely miss all of 2019 due to the timing of his surgery.   MacGregor's velocity spiked late during his high school career and the Pirates jumped on him earlier in the draft than he was expected to go.

The Pirates knew it might take a while for the right-hander to figure things out and he had an up-and-down first two summers of pro ball. It looked like he was taking a major step forward in 2018 during his full-season debut, but September Tommy John surgery will keep him out for all of the 2019 season.  Thanks to some tweaks to his delivery, MacGregor was having greater success in 2018 before he blew out his elbow. He was getting his fastball up to 96-97 mph and he was missing bats and getting ground-ball outs as he continued to improve his command of the pitch. He was still working to refine his secondary stuff, but he showed at least an average changeup and was throwing his breaking ball for strikes more frequently. His overall command within the strike zone was improving, as he went from a .339 batting average against in the Appalachian League in 2017 to a .237 BAA in the South Atlantic League a year later.  The Pirates hope MacGregor can wipe the slate clean and start over in 2020.

In instructional league, he ran his fastball up to 96 mph, which didn't happen often in college, and his signature hammer curveball flashed plus once again.

Scouts never got the chance because the right-hander missed the 2017 season with a stress fracture in his back. He was healthy and pitched well in 2018, leading to the Braves taking him in the fourth round and going over slot to sign him for $900,000.  Beck is a very polished college pitcher who has an advanced feel to pitch. He reminds some in the organization of Kyle Wright in that regard, albeit without the same kind of power repertoire. But while Beck has more pitchability than wow stuff, there might be more in there than some anticipated. His fastball sits around 91-92 mph now, but he could add a few ticks as he adds strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, and he was showing more of that during his time in instructs last fall. He uses a plus changeup and average breaking ball effectively when he's at his best.  One thing Beck will need to learn is that his stuff is good enough to get pro hitters out. He had a tendency to pitch to pro hitters like he did in college, leaning heavily on his breaking stuff. But the Braves think he has more than enough fastball to pitch off that more than he has.

But about a month before he walked, the Department of Defense began once again requiring at least two years of active duty before graduates could apply to serve out their time in reserve status for the purpose of playing pro sports. Then baseball was reinstated as an Olympic sport, and Jax found an avenue to pro ball through the World Class Athlete Program, a military unit focused on training for the Games in the two years leading up to competition. So Jax, having sorted out some arcane rules about Air Force personnel being unable to have second streams of income, is technically an Air Force lieutenant training for the 2020 Olympics, while the Twins pay for his development, but don't pay him.  Jax was 89-94 throughout the 2018 Fall League, with his secondary stuff about average, flashing above (especially the change). He could be a fifth starter, but if his fastball ticks up in short relief, he'll fit in a mid-inning bullpen role.

He managed to log just under 40 innings over his first two summers, graduating in the interim, and then eventually had his requirement deferred as he was put in the World Class Athlete Program, designed to allow athletes to pursue sports and train for the Olympics. He managed to log over 100 innings in the Florida State League and then the Arizona Fall League in 2018.  Jax was able to gain entry into the WCAP thanks to baseball's re-inclusion into the 2020 Olympics and that means he gets to be a full-time Twins prospect now. That should allow him to refine his three-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball in the 90-94 mph range, sitting mostly around 92 mph, with excellent run and sink. His changeup is his best weapon, an offspeed pitch he'll throw to both left- and right-handed hitters. He'll mix in his fringy slider effectively and is an extreme strike-thrower with all three as more of a ground ball, pitch-to-contact, guy than a strikeout pitcher.  While Jax is lean, he is in excellent military shape and he has a bit of a bulldog mentality on the mound, perhaps handed down by his father, former NFL linebacker Garth Jax.

His upper-80s fastball is vulnerable when it's not in the right places, so Gonsalves has become a little walk-prone and gives up loud contact when he makes mistakes in the zone. Unless he can reclaim an ability to locate his fastball where it plays best (up near the letters), he'll need to work heavily off his bevy of quality secondary offerings to get through a lineup multiple times.

When he did get the chance in August, however, he really struggled to find the strike zone. His command in the Minors regressed a bit as well, but he didn't get hit en route to finishing second in the organization in ERA.  Outside of an inflated walk rate in the Minors, Gonsalves wasn't hittable and posted low ERAs in both Double-A and Triple-A, using his typical feel for pitching and deception to allow his largely average stuff play up. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, though he can reach back for more on occasion, and he throws it with good life. His sinking changeup is his best pitch, a plus offspeed offering that he keeps down in the zone. He mixes in his average curveball effectively.  The Twins hope the adversity Gonsalves faced in his brief big league stint will help him move forward in the long run.

At Florida State, he developed skills that work best in today's game: he's not seen as a lock to stick at a catcher but has above average arm strength to work with and is a plus framer according to some clubs' metrics.

It's still on display this spring with IMG Academy, though questions remain about how much he'll need to hit to tap into that plus tool.  Hinds has performed well on big stages, including Major League Baseball's High School Home Run Derby during All-Star Weekend. It's not just batting practice power, as Hinds did hit two homers during his stint at the Tournament of Stars. But with that power came a lot of swing and miss, with scouts worrying about his pitch recognition, particularly his ability to pick up spin. Ideally, Hinds will be able to stick at third, where his power bat would profile well, and he does have enough arm for the spot, though the jury is still out whether he can man the hot corner long-term, with him better at quick reactive plays while he struggles when he has time to worry about his footwork. He has seen some time in the outfield, but that hasn't gone well.  One scout compared Hinds defensively to Phillies prospect Alec Bohm, who was the No. 3 overall pick in last year's Draft.

Compared to Cleveland's other top signing from last summer, Venezuelan shortstop Gabriel Rodriguez, he's a little less polished as a hitter but might have a bit more raw power. They could debut alongside each other on the left side of the infield in the Rookie-level Arizona League this summer.  Sanquintin is stronger and more physical than the typical teenaged middle infielder, and he has impressive bat speed from both sides of the plate.

He served as a mid-week starter for part of his freshman year before finding his niche as the Tigers' closer the next two years. That late-inning potential earned Gilliam a fifth-round selection by the Mets in 2018, and he excelled as Short-Season Class A Brooklyn's closer in his pro debut, saving five games and averaging better than 16 strikeouts per nine across 17 appearances.   Gilliam may be undersized, listed at 5-foot-10, but he has a super quick arm that produces a plus fastball at 96-97 mph. His curveball gives him a second plus pitch, registering in the upper 70s with downer action. He can induce whiffs with both pitches, and did so at a 17-percent clip in his pro debut while striking out nearly 42 percent of the hitters he faced. Gilliam works with a high-tempo delivery that adds some funk and deception, but also makes it difficult for him to control his offerings at times. He averaged 4.7 walks per nine in college, followed by 6.8 in the New York-Penn League.   That Gilliam is a good athlete reduces some of the durability concerns that his size creates, and it should also allow him to make gains in terms of harnessing his stuff.

His slider is his best secondary pitch, but all three grade various versions of average, and his control, if not his command, is above average.

While he doesn't have huge raw power, there's some definite thump from the right side of the plate and he can punish mistakes. While he was a shortstop in high school, he doesn't have the arm or speed to play there, but he should be a reliable defender at second base.    It's the bat, though, that will get him drafted in the early rounds of the 2019 Draft. He profiles as an offensive-minded second baseman with some power, kind of like a right-handed version of Bruin product Kevin Kramer, who made his big league debut with the Pirates in 2018.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","","11","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","51","64","\"CHC\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","25","50","50","45","50","55","40","50","50","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","45","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["651","648","541","451","593","\"44.1\"","\"44.3\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.8\"","\"37.2\"","\"49.8\"","\"|\"","\"Aaron\"","\"Bracho\"","2019","\"18.1\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","1960","677570","","","","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","\"KgDmgu7Ljlg\"","","\"A broken arm shelved Bracho for all of 2018, save for a sliver of extended spring training, but he has been heavily scouted since age 14, when he impressed at the 2016 PG World Showcase in the states, so scouts are well acquainted with him even though he's never played an official pro game. The totality of his defensive abilities (his hands, actions, arm strength) all likely push him to second base, and the presence of Rocchio, Sanquintin, and Rodriguez make that future even more likely.   But several promising offensive traits -- a swing with natural loft, plus bat speed, precocious barrel control that is better from the left side -- excite us. Hes an up-the-middle prospect with a well-rounded offensive skillset. We're unsure how Cleveland will resolve their lower-level logjam of middle infielders but the fact that they're poised to have two AZL teams for the second year in a row should open up sufficient at-bats for everyone including Bracho, if they feel his lost year means he should stay in Arizona for the summer.\"","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - CLE\"","2022","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  The Indians continued their recent trend of collecting international players with advanced bats when they signed Bracho out of Venezuela for $1.5 million, the largest bonus in their 2017 class.

He'll see his first pro action this summer in the AZL.  A switch-hitter, Bracho has a quick, compact swing and exhibits precocious feel for the barrel from both sides of the plate. He makes repeated hard contact, already drives balls to the gaps and should have 20-homer power once he matures physically. Presently an above-average runner, he figures to slow down a bit as he gets stronger.   Though Bracho will break into pro ball as a shortstop, most international scouts pegged him as a future second baseman.

Sparks shows a quick right-handed bat with present raw power from the right side of the plate, though there is some length to his swing that leads evaluators to question the future utility of his hit tool.

Not only does he throw hard, but his power curveball has big, bat-missing depth and competes for swings and misses in the zone. His arm speed enables very favorable changeup projection and Paredes already flashes some plus cambios on occasion. He can shorten the curveball into a slider or add cut action to his fastball, but the other three pitches should be sufficient for him to play a strikeout-heavy relief role.   We don't stick many 23-year-old A-ball relievers on the 40 FV tier of lists, but Paredes only signed at age 19 and hasn't had as much pro development as other same-aged Latin American players, and he's not yet occupying a 40-man spot.

Paredes idolized the late Yordano Ventura, another short Dominican righty with humble beginnings. He doesn't throw quite as hard as Ventura did, but his electric arm speed produces 92-94 mph fastballs that top out at 96. His low-80s slider is a solid second pitch and while his changeup is in its early stages, it features promising deception.  Paredes has an athletic delivery and doesn't work with a lot of effort.

He was able to advance to full season ball in 2018, though he was shut down in July with forearm tightness.  Bolton is healthy and back on track for 2019 so he can get back to developing his interesting three-pitch mix. He'll actually throw a pair of fastballs in the 90-95 mph range, a two-seamer with sink that can elicit weak contact on the ground as well as a four-seamer. As he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame, there could be more velocity to come. Like many young pitchers, his secondary stuff still needs work, but his feel for his slider and changeup all point to them being at least solid average pitches in the future. There's not a lot of track record, but Bolton has thus far filled up the strike zone consistently.

He'll likely be the first reliever drafted in 2019, perhaps as high as the second round by a team that places a lot of emphasis on analytics.    There's nothing subtle about Cronin, who attacks hitters with two plus pitches that feature outstanding spin rates. His 92-96 mph fastball gets great carry in the strike zone, appearing to rise as it reaches the plate. His over-the-top arm slot helps him get nice depth on his curveball, which can be a true hammer in the mid 70s.    Cronin has a lot of effort and some recoil in his delivery, so there's no thought of trying to deploy him as a starter.

His 112 strikeouts this year are the second-most in school history, though he went just 1-7 with a 4.85 ERA for a 15-41 club. Nevertheless, he should surpass David Buchanan (seventh round, 2010) as the highest-drafted Panther ever.  When he's on top of his game, Gaddis attacks hitters with a low-90s sinker and a mid-80s slider/cutter. Too often this spring, he lacked deception and command of his two-seam fastball and relied on his fringy curveball at the expense of his better breaking ball. He also struggled with the feel for his changeup, which has some fade but sometimes arrives in the upper 60s.  Gaddis opens up too early in his delivery, which can add some sink to his two-seamer but detracts from his other offerings. While he never has had trouble finding the zone, he needs to improve the quality of his strikes rather than just laying the ball over the middle of the plate. If he focuses on his sinker and slider and betters his command in pro ball, he should fare better than he did in his final college season.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CLE\"","","33","\"2019 Draft Rnd 5 (CLE)\"","\"|\"","134","160","\"CLE\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.3\"","\"50.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.5000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","45","50","45","","","","50","50","55","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","45","55","","","","50","","",""],["661","658","597","684","470","\"44.0\"","\"43.9\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.5\"","\"44.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Grove\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2775","675627","","","\"sa3008625\"","\"|\"","","\"West Virginia\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","","\" \"","\"Grove was working 92-96 with a good slider when he blew out his elbow two months into his sophomore season at West Virginia. He didn't pitch as a junior, but clearly the Dodgers stayed on him, scouted the bullpen sessions he threw as the draft approached, and liked what they saw; they popped him in the second round. He spent the rest of the year finishing rehab and working on a changeup in the bullpen.   Back in games this spring, Grove has been 93-95, up to 96.6, with a 12:30 spin axis, which teams like LA and Houston seem to prefer, as 12:30 is almost pure backspin, a component of fastball rise. Grove has two different breaking balls, a low-80s curveball and an upper-80s slider, but it's clear changeup development is the priority right now. The Dodgers sent Grove straight to Hi-A and it appears he'll be on an innings limit and throw shorter outings so he can pitch all year rather than go six or seven innings at a shot and be shut down sometime during the summer. He's well-built, athletic, throws hard, and has good measurable spin, and the Dodgers have a pretty good track record of developing arms, including several with college injuries. Though scouts we spoke with who saw Grove this spring thought he lacked feel, that could be chalked up to rust, and we like Grove as a riser.\"","\"|\"","","\"LAD\"","\"2018, 2nd (68) - LAD\"","","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  The biggest surprise on the first day of the 2018 Draft came when Los Angeles took Grove in the second round after he had missed his entire junior season at West Virginia while recovering from Tommy John surgery. He intrigued scouts with his electric arm in early 2017 but blew out his elbow that April and had it reconstructed two months later. The Dodgers have scored by drafting pitchers who had or needed Tommy John surgery (Caleb Ferguson in 2014, Walker Buehler in 2015) and signed him for a well over-slot $1,229,500 -- which didn't leave enough in their bonus pool to sign first-rounder J.T. Ginn.  When healthy, Grove had a pair of legitimate plus pitches. His 92-96 mph fastball featured running and cutting action and his mid-80s slider had high spin rates and tremendous depth. That combination gives him a high floor as at least a late-inning reliever.  To make it as a starter, Grove will have to refine a changeup he didn't use much as an amateur and throw enough strikes to be efficient with his pitch counts. There's some effort in his delivery, though it provides some deception as well. He uses his 6-foot-3 frame and high three-quarters arm slot to create steep downhill plane on his pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAD\"","\"A+\"","18","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.3\"","\"50.8\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","0005-01-17","2300","2500","40","50","40","50","","","","50","55","45","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","","60","","","","50","","",""],["662","659","563","685","371","\"44.0\"","\"44.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.1\"","\"43.8\"","\"50.7\"","\"|\"","\"Alex\"","\"McFarlane\"","2019","\"18.0\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"173\"","\"draft\"","160","4","\"|\"","2910","","\"mcfarlane_alex\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Habersham Central HS\"","0","0","","","","40","","\"McFarlane is projectable, loose and comes at hitters from a tough lower arm slot where he slings solid average stuff.\"","","\"|\"","\"Habersham Central (Ga.)

The son of a 1988 Olympics taekwondo participant (Tami Noel) and a former sprinter (Roy McFarlane), he may have the best chance to remain a starter among the Peach State's best prep arms this spring. He's also strongly committed to Miami, so he could slide out of the top five rounds.  Projectable and athletic, McFarlane could have two plus pitches once he matures physically. He can reach 95 mph early in games and sit at 90-93 with riding action for stretches, though his velocity faded a bit as the Draft approached.

He was inconsistent that summer and then didn't play up to expectations during his senior year. That, plus his commitment to the University of Florida, led to him getting drafted in the 33rd round of the 2017 Draft. Two years later, as a Draft-eligible sophomore, McConnell's stock was on the rise as a consistent college hitter after missing most of his freshman season with injury.  McConnell's offensive profile stands out the most. The 6-foot-3 infielder has the chance to hit at the next level with a knack for barreling up the baseball that's been on display all spring. He's added strength to his wiry frame, and he's showing more ability to drive the ball, with the chance for future average power. A good athlete and plus runner, McConnell can steal a base as well.   The jury is out whether he can stick at shortstop in the long-term. Some see a move to second base, but those who think his actions and hands are what's holding him back think he'd be best off in center field, where his athleticism would play well.

Fitterer's combination of stuff and pitchability give him the chance to be the first on both fronts, though teams wanting to sign him might have to contend with his commitment to UCLA.  Fitterer's command and the projection for more in the tank are reasons teams were starting to look at the right-hander in the first three rounds of the Draft. He's been up to as high as 95 mph and has sat 90-93 mph consistently while throwing a four-seamer and   a two-seamer. The two-seamer has plus sink and run at times, sometimes throwing with cutter-like action. He'll throw both a curve and slider and though both blend into each other and get slurvy, he does have feel to spin it. The slider is a tick ahead now, but the curve could provide a different contrast with more depth from his cutting fastball in the future. His changeup has the chance to be at least above-average, though he hasn't used it as much this spring.

His stuff ticked up (92-96 with sink, an above-average split, average slider) as a sophomore and then backed up the following year. While Jones has not performed statistically in either of his two full pro seasons, his sinker is back and has been very difficult for minor league hitters to lift, enabling him to generate a 66% ground ball rate during his pro career. In the Arizona Fall League, Jones' sinker was a heavy 92-96, touching 98. His curveball is average, flashes above, and is consistently located down and to his glove side. His profile has some concerning elements: his stuff and command have been inconcsistent, his repertoire has been altered in several ways, and he missed three weeks due to injury in 18. But Jones has shown an ability to make adjustments and he has a freakish pitch. He's likely to play some kind of bullpen role, at least.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2016, 2nd (70) - STL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Jones parlayed a strong career as a starter at the University of Virginia, including a championship in his sophomore year, into becoming a second-round pick in the 2016 Draft. Though he was thought to be a quick-to-the-big-leagues college performer, control issues and below-average strikeout rates have led to a more gradual climb through the Minors for the right-hander. After pitching to mixed results as a starter in 2018, in his first true exposure at the Double- and Triple-A levels, Jones flashed late-inning upside as a reliever in the Arizona Fall League.   Jones' fastball is a standout pitch in terms of both velocity and movement. He sits in the low- to mid-90s as a starter but showed in the AFL that he can dial it up to 97-98 mph out of the bullpen. On top of the velocity, Jones throws the pitch with elite sinking action that netted the best ground-ball rate in professional baseball (68.5 percent) in 2017 and the sixth-best mark (62.3) in the Minors in '18 (100 IP min.). While his sinker is his calling card and ticket to the big leagues, Jones also has a nasty 12-to-6 curveball that he throws with power in the low- to mid-80s, along with a mid-80s changeup that has splitter action.  Jones has smoothed out his delivery somewhat since his college days, but he is still learning how to repeat it consistently. That's led to more control issues than anticipated, with a 5.3 BB/9 rate in his second full season. But with his three-pitch mix and elite ground-ball tendencies, Jones still has the chance to be a back-end starter if he can learn to throw more strikes. If it doesn't come together, his sinker-breaking ball combination could make him a fixture in a big league bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","17","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"48.3\"","\"52.5\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","1.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","1900","2600","40","70","50","50","","","","45","70","55","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","50","55","","","","","40","\"OAK\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["666","663","538","688","321","\"44.0\"","\"44.3\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.5\"","\"45.4\"","\"51.0\"","\"|\"","\"Garrett\"","\"Stallings\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"200\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2963","","\"stallings_garrett\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Tennessee\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","\"Pitchability righty has gaudy numbers and flashes above average stuff.\"","\"Pitchability righty throws a ton of strikes and has average stuff.\"","\"|\"","\"Tennessee\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-garrett-stallings-p?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  Stallings threw a shutout to win the title game of the heavily scouted 2015 World Wood Bat Association World Championship showcase, but his polish stood out more than his stuff.

He still fits the same profile in 2019, but three years of success as a member of a weekend rotation in the Southeastern Conference should get him picked in the first four or five rounds.  Stallings lacks a true plus pitch, but he has several effective offerings and there's no clear consensus as to which is his best. Though his fastball velocity is nothing special at 88-91 mph and a peak of 93, his heater plays up because he sinks and commands it so well, and it works well in concert with his changeup that features similar movement. He has improved his curveball this year, and both it and his slider/cutter can be solid pitches.  Without overpowering stuff, Stallings has little margin for error and thrives by limiting his mistakes. He has tremendous feel for locating, manipulating and sequencing his pitches, and he tossed complete-game shutouts against two of the SEC's better clubs (Georgia and Mississippi) this spring.

From there, he was on to Mississippi State, where he had a solid junior season, posting a .344/.435/.550 line. In 2016, his battery-mate Dakota Hudson went in the first round to the Cardinals. Kruger went in the 20th, getting an above slot $395,000 to sign.    After a solid pro debut at the rookie levels, Kruger had a relatively nondescript first full season across two levels of A ball. The athletic backstop broke out in 2018, reaching Double-A and hitting for average at both stops. It's a contact-oriented approach, with the ability to shoot the ball to all fields, and Kruger did a nice job of managing the strike zone and drawing walks for much of the 2018 season. He's not a big power guy, but does have some juice to his pull side. He runs well for a catcher and can even steal a base, and that athleticsm plays pretty well behind the plate, where he's a solid receiver who has thrown out 27.5 percent of potential basestealers.

He sits in the low 90s and can reach back for 97 mph with his fastball, and some evaluators believe his low-80s slider is a slightly better offering. He works his slider to both sides of the plate against left-handers and can backfoot it versus right-handers, giving him a chance to be more than just a lefty speicialist.  Quijada will also mix in a changeup to try to keep righties off-balance. Before he gets his first big league opportunity, he'll need to tighten his control and command, which haven't been as sharp in the upper levels of the Minors. He has been durable throughout his pro career, only missing time with a pectoral strain in 2015.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIA\"","\"AAA\"","24","\"2013 J2 (MIA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.2\"","\"49.2\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2500","40","50","40","","55","","","45","55","45","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","","55","","","","45","","",""],["669","666","791","1059","612","\"43.9\"","\"42.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"48.7\"","\"46.2\"","\"48.9\"","\"|\"","\"Robert\"","\"Dugger\"","2019","\"23.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2671","667498","","","\"sa918433\"","\"|\"","","\"Texas Tech\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2020","40","","","\"Dugger was dealt before the 2018 season from Seattle to Miami in the Dee Gordon trade.

C.J. had a big pro debut, getting to High-A and playing in instructs in a season that saw him in real games from late January until October. He has plus raw power and a plus arm, with deceptive contact skills and at least passable defense at all four corner spots. The upside is a low-end regular or the correct side of a corner platoon, which is more likely to happen if he continues to move quickly through the system.

His older brother, coming off a fine junior college season at the State College of Florida, went nine rounds later and got $125,000 to join the Braves. The older Alexander had a huge professional debut, which included considerable time in the Class A Advanced Florida State League, putting him firmly on the prospect map. That momentum was stalled when he needed Tommy John surgery in late April.  Right out of the gate, Alexander showed an advanced feel to hit and a good understanding of the strike zone. He's at least an above-average hitter with a chance for more if he shows he can replicate what he did in his first pro summer. During his debut, Alexander used the middle of the field and left-center extremely well, focusing on contact. He had more of a pull approach as a junior college player and if he can find some balance between the two, his raw power will show up more consistently as well.  A fringy runner, Alexander is far from a base-clogger, and he has enough range and agility to go along with a strong arm to profile well at third.

He has really great feel to hit, and not just for his age. It's punchy, all-fields contact right now. Garcia's swing has an abbreviated finish and he's already a pretty stocky kid without much room for mass, so it's unlikely he develops big home run power as he matures; he might never hit more than 12-15 bombs. But he's going to hit a ton and he's athletic enough to have tried shortstop, though he probably fits best at second base, where he might be above-average. Depending on how his bat develops, he could be a Cesar Hernandez type of regular who makes a ton of contact and plays a premium position, which would generate a significant amount of value even if there's not much pop here. The Cubs have pushed advanced hitters like this pretty aggressively of late, but Garcia is just so young that we anticipate he'll be in extended next year, then head to Eugene for the start of his summer.

By then he already had established that he could hold his own against much older competition in the Rookie-level Arizona League. He's one of several prospects signed out of Mexico by the Cubs, who bought him from the Mexican League's Yucatan Lions for $500,000 in 2017.  To call Garcia an advanced hitter for his age may not do him enough justice. A switch-hitter, he has a compact swing from both sides of the plate that produces easy line-drive contact to all fields. He needs to get stronger but may not have more than fringy power after he physically matures.  In addition to his ability to put the bat on the ball, Garcia stands out for his instincts. He knows how to use his average speed on the bases and to get to balls in the middle infield.

His stuff steadily has improved in his three years at the NCAA Division II program, to the point where he should be the first small school player selected in 2019. He should eclipse big leaguer Anthony Bass (fifth round, 2008) by a couple of rounds as the highest pick ever from the Warriors.  Brown peaked at 91 mph with his fastball as a freshman, at 93 mph as a sophomore and at 95 mph on Wayne State's scout day last fall. This spring he has shown the ability to sit at 96-98 mph for three innings at a time, work consistently at 92-96 and maintain overpowering velocity on his four-seamer deep into games. The pitch stands out more for the downhill plane that results from his high-three-quarters arm slot than its life, though he also will throw a two-seamer with some sink in the low 90s.  His slider also has gotten considerably better during his time at Wayne State, and it can be a plus pitch in the mid-80s with bite and depth at its best. Brown hasn't had to use his changeup much and he'll need to achieve greater velocity separation from his fastball.

The most electric version of Sauer has a high-leverage fastball/curveball combination, a two-pitch duo that could close games. If Sauer's changeup and command improve, he has mid-rotation upside.

After sitting around 90 mph the year before, he suddenly started popping 97s and his stock soared along with his velocity. The Yankees took him in the second round and signed him away from an Arizona commitment for $2,497,500 -- $313,200 more than they paid first-rounder Clarke Schmidt.   Sauer's fastball sat at 90-93 mph at the beginning of last summer, when he focused on his changeup and dialed down his velocity to throw more strikes, but he was back up to 93-96 toward the end of the season. After he threw both a curveball and a slider as an amateur, New York has had him concentrate on his curve, which can be a low-80s hammer but lacks consistency. He's making encouraging progress with his changeup after not using it much before turning pro.  The Yankees like Sauer's combination of size, strength and athleticism, which they think bodes well for having the control and durability to be a starter.

He uses his solid average slider a lot, throwing it with good three-quarter angle with curveball-like depth to it. His low 80s changeup gives him a third Major League average offering, and he sells it well with good arm speed.

When he was one of the dozen prospects declared a free agent by Major League Baseball as a result of Atlanta's international signing violations, the Royals swept in and signed him for $650,000. After a bit of a slow start to his first season in the organization, Del Rosario finished strong, capping off the year with six shutout innings in a playoff start.  It's taken some time for Del Rosario to build up to handling a starting pitcher's workload. The Braves had kept him to very tight pitch counts and he began his full-season debut in 2018 not ready to pitch deep into games every fifth day. He started to adapt to his new surroundings and gained an understanding of preparing between starts as the season progressed, going at least six innings in five of his six final regular season starts. His stuff was all there as well, with a live fastball coming from a fast arm that touches 97 mph and has the chance for more consistent velocity as he continues to add strength. His breaking ball is a bit of a hybrid between a curve and slider, but it's sharp and hard and misses bats.

But he also didn't pitch much last year while dealing with elbow issues that recurred this spring and he may be difficult to sign away from a South Carolina commitment. On talent alone he could fit in the first two rounds, though medical and signability concerns cloud his Draft status.    On his best days, Thomas can sit at 91-94 mph for innings at a time and touch 96 with his fastball. He uses his 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot to create downhill angle on his heater and 12-6 break on his curveball, which can be a low-80s hammer at its sharpest. The quality of his fastball and curve varies, however, and his changeup is much more of a work in progress than his other two offerings.    Thomas pitches exclusively out of the stretch and provides plenty of strikes with his simple delivery.

He spread out too much in his stance, slowing his bat and creating holes in his swing.

Kochanowicz has an 89-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 with riding life up in the strike zone.

More polished than the average teenager, the Venezuela native has already shown the ability to hit well in games. A compact swing and solid approach allow Alvarez to hit to all fields, and he has plenty of raw power to continue to tap into. He's a below-average runner, but also isn't a base-clogger. Alvarez's defensive game is behind his bat, but club officials have zero doubt that he can stay behind the plate long term. He has a strong arm and some solid actions behind the plate, but he'll have to improve his overall receiving.   That Alvarez has a thicker build and is already very strong for his age does lead to some concerns about his body, and he likely will have to watch his conditioning. The Mets don't believe that will be an issue, though, as Alvarez earns high marks for his willingness to learn and make adjustments.

Not only was Johnny O younger than most of his high school prospect peers, but potential shortstops with plus bat speed aren't often available past the draft's first few picks. Though his swing -- both the bat path and his footwork -- may need tweaks in pro ball, Ornelas is capable of clearing his hips and unloading on pitches on the inner half. He struggles to make impact contact on pitches in other parts of the strike zone, but his hands have promising explosion and could yield all-fields doubles power with refinement. On defense, Ornelas has plus infield actions, he's a 55 runner with sufficient middle infield range, and he has a chance to be a 50 glove at shortstop.

He earned some Javy Baez comparisons for his power and flashiness before signing with the Rangers for $622,800 in the third round. In his pro debut, he batted .302 with 17 extra-base hits and 15 steals in 48 games in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Ornelas generates power with bat speed and a big leg kick and already has gotten stronger since turning pro, showing the potential for 20-homer power once he's physically mature. His hand-eye coordination allows him to make consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate and he also shows some patience as well. He's a fringy runner with good instincts on the bases.   Ornelas has a good first step and an internal clock that helps him make plays at shortstop, but he'll profile better at third base once he matures physically. He saw more time at the hot corner than at short in his first taste of pro ball while also getting some brief action at second base, where he spent most of his time at the start of 2019.

He matriculated to Oregon State, where his abilities sufficed to push phenom Nick Madrigal over to second base. Indeed Grenier is the rare college player who scouts saw as capable of playing shortstop. He's a plus-plus runner with a plus arm, and infield-worthy footwork and actions. Neither acrobatic nor sexy in any way, Grenier's look as a defender, and his overall profile, has been compared to J.J. Hardy's. Like Hardy, Grenier also has some power but his college swing likely needs to be altered for him to get to it in games. With player development now firmly ensconced in the era of swing changes, it seems reasonable to anticipate that Grenier will make some adjustments. The track record for college shortstops is not great, but Grenier has everyday tools.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2018, CBA (37) - BAL\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  A product of prep baseball powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, Grenier honored his commitment to Oregon State rather than sign with the Cardinals as their 21st-round pick in the 2015 Draft. He was a three-year starter for the Beavers and helped lead the program to a College World Series title in 2018, when he won the Brooks Wallace Award as college baseball's top shortstop. The Orioles made Grenier the No. 37 overall pick that June, signed him for $1.8 million and then sent him straight to Class A Delmarva for his professional debut.   Grenier is a gifted defender at shortstop, with the range, actions and arm strength, as well as the soft hands and outstanding internal clock, needed to stay at the position long-term. There are questions about Grenier's bat, though, and he didn't assuage any concerns by hitting .216 with an elevated strikeout rate in his pro debut. That said, he does have bat speed and a little pop to his pull side, with solid understanding of the strike zone.   The Orioles believe Grenier's emphasis on making contact early in the count instilled an element of panic in his swing, and they worked with him in during hitter mini camps in the fall on developing a better foundation to hit. At worst, Grenier has a career as a defensive-minded utilityman ahead of him, with the upside of being a glove-first regular at shortstop.

Even before he scuffled in Triple-A, Stephens has been destined more for a middle-relief role than a rotation spot in the big leagues.

Then the brakes got hit hard when a bulging disc in his back kept him out for all of 2017. He did return healthy to pitch across both levels of A ball in 2018.  While Bowden has the raw stuff to start, and he did get a handful of chances to do so during his junior year at Vandy, his demeanor really fits well in the back end of a bullpen. He'll aggressively go right after hitters with his three-pitch mix with an ability to challenge in all areas of the strike zone.

Gordon, the son of former big league pitcher Tom, and Dee's brother, was taken No. 5 overall in the 2014 Draft and in many ways has been chasing the status attached with his name and position in the Draft. While he hasn't been the elite-level player some hoped he would be, he did perform extremely well in Double-A and reached Triple-A at age 22, though he struggled mightily upon his arrival.  Things started off well enough in 2018 for Gordon, who was having a bit of a breakout offensively when he hit .333 with a .906 OPS in the Southern League and earned a bump up a level in late May. After hitting well initially, the wheels came off and his struggles snowballed. One of the biggest causes for the fade, something that also happened in 2017, was a lack of strength that led to questions of durability. To his credit, Gordon learned a lesson last year and worked hard this offseason to add strength. When he's doing well, he has an excellent line-drive approach that leads to good contact, and he showed early on last year that there is some extra-base authority in his left-handed swing.  An average runner, Gordon won't wow anyone on the basepaths or in the field, but his plus instincts help him steal bases and be more than capable on both sides of second base and still have the chance to be a solid big-league regular.

His hands are very powerful, explosive, and work in a tight, lift-friendly loop much like Carter Kieboom's, but Arias doesn't track pitches well, and makes poor choices about what he's swinging at. He needs to refine his approach so more of that power plays in games, because he'll likely always have a bit of a whiff problem due to his swing being so geared for power.

At age 17, he was promoted to Class A Fort Wayne and held his own, hitting .276 in the Midwest League playoffs before turning in a strong showing in the Australian Baseball League. Arias remained with Fort Wayne for the entirety of the '18 season, and he slumped to a .654 OPS. But he remained an expert defensively, and he came on strong offensively toward the end of the season.   Arias has all the tools to become a plus defender at short, where he has very good hands, footwork and control of his body. His arm strength and range make it clear he's cut out for the position long-term. He has strides to make at the plate, however. A right-handed hitter, Arias' swing can get long and his plate approach needs a bit of work.  If he can refine his swing, Arias is expected to generate some power as he develops physically. He already hits the ball hard, gap-to-gap.

As an amateur prospect, he was on the radar pretty early; the Canadian Junior National Team plays a strong schedule that includes a spring training tilt against the Blue Jays, so they typically travel with their top underclassmen. Hall was a middle-round prospect for most scouts, who saw him as more of a second baseman and questioned his ability to hit, but still liked the plus speed and average raw power. Enthusiasts rounded up on the hitting skills because of his cold weather background. Baltimore popped Hall in the second round in 2017, but he didn't play an extended run of regular season professional games until the summer of 2018.   Sources tell us he was excellent in the lightly-scouted extended spring training camp early in 2018, then struggled early in the New York-Penn League season as he had a red light on stealing bases in hitter's counts. Later in that season, we're told that Hall ignored that directive; he swiped 15 bases in August alone, then had a strong instructional league showing. Other clubs noticed and hoped they could snatch him in a minor trade during Baltimore's regime change. He now looks more like a viable shortstop. He's bigger and stronger, with a better sense of the strike zone and what kind of swing and approach works for him. We've moved him up pretty aggressively as there's a story to his improvement that makes sense and he's from a demographic that's usually later to peak.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2017, 2nd (60) - BAL\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  After strong performances with the Canadian junior national team had pushed him up Draft boards in 2017, Hall landed an above-slot $1.3 million signing bonus from the Orioles after they took him the second round. An oblique injury limited him to just two games that summer, and Hall struggled at the outset of 2018, hitting .212 with a .524 OPS during his first month in the New York-Penn League. He broke out in the second half, raking at a .358 clip (.913 OPS) over his final 36 contests, and authored a 19-game hit streak along the way.   Hall has natural feel to hit, demonstrating good bat speed and the ability to hit to all fields from the right side of the plate, albeit with below-average power. He does have some pop to the gaps, however, and should be a consistent source of doubles and triples as he adds strength to his athletic frame. Plus speed might be Hall's best tool, and club officials rave about his baserunning instincts. Hall's defense and arm have improved considerably in the professional ranks to the point where scouts now view him as an above-average defender who can stick at shortstop.   With his slow start and torrid finish, Hall arguably was Baltimore's most improved prospect in 2018. Club officials are quick to praise infield coordinator Dave Anderson and hitting coordinator Jeff Manto for their role in his development, as they each spent a lot of time working with Hall and made him a more confident player overall. He doesn't have a very high ceiling, but the tools and skills are all there for Hall to develop into an everyday player.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"A\"","13","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (BAL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"49.1\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","50","60","45","55","50","40","50","60","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","60","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["700","697","558","669","399","\"43.8\"","\"44.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.9\"","\"45.5\"","\"50.3\"","\"|\"","\"Brandon\"","\"Williamson\"","2019","\"21.2\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"78\"","\"210\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2464","","\"williamson_brandon\"","","","\"|\"","","\"TCU\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","40","","\"Williamson has a fringy fastball but knows how to pitch and figures to improve on his offers out of an Iowa JC last summer.\"","\"Williamson has a fringy fastball but knows how to pitch and figures to improve on his offers out of an Iowa JC last summer.\"","\"|\"","\"Texas Christian\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-williamson-lhp?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45    Williamson burst onto the prospect scene last spring at North Iowa Area CC, and he might have gone in the first three rounds of the 2018 Draft if his asking price hadn't pushed him to Texas Christian. A 36th-round choice by the Brewers last June, he didn't pitch in the fall while recovering from surgery to repair the labrum in both of his hips, then performed well at two heavily scouted tournaments at the beginning of this season. He hasn't been as consistent since but still offers enough upside to factor in the top three rounds.    When he's at his best, Williamson can operate at 91-94 mph and reach 96 with his fastball, which plays up with late life and downhill plane, and backs it up with a mid-80s slider. At other times, he'll work around 90 mph with his heater and lose velocity and sharpness on his slider. He can achieve good depth on his curveball and some tumble on his changeup, though the latter offering can get too firm.    Williamson has the athleticism and easy arm action to throw strikes but sometimes battles his control and command. His 6-foot-5 frame not only creates difficult angle but also has projection remaining.

What he appears to lack at this point is barrel control and a bat path that enables the power. Those are important components and may not be easy to fix, especially the bat control issue. But Patino's ball/strike and breaking ball recognition could help mitigate those issues, and his ceiling (a high OBP center fielder with power) is lofty if they're overcome.

The Venezuela native is extremely athletic with a projectable body and the potential to have plus tools across the board. He showed an advanced approach during his pro debut, and he's poised to start impacting the ball more consistently as he adds strength and gains experience. A decent runner, Patino has the potential to be a base-stealer and profiles well in center field, where he has impressed scouts with his defensive actions and range. He has plenty of arm strength for the position and could probably play all three outfield positions if needed.  The D-backs have been very impressed with Patino's athleticism and by how quickly he's added size and strength since entering their system.

Jenista is a late-count, power-focused hitter, so his approach will come with some swing-and-miss and some walks. He'll need a slight adjustment to his swing plane, as it's a little too flat for this type of player (he hits more doubles when he makes hard contact than you'd like), and he may age more quickly than player with a slighter build would.

Bohm went No. 3 overall in the 2018 Draft, but because Jenista wasn't able to carry over his Cape Cod League MVP performance and turned in a bit of an uneven junior season, he ended up being available for the Braves to select in the second round. He did hit his way up to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in his pro debut.  Big and physical at 6-foot-4, Jenista is surprisingly athletic and shows more tools than you might think upon first glance. In college and during most of his pro debut, Jenista showed the ability to consistently barrel up the baseball with a largely line-drive-oriented approach and swing path, while limiting strikeouts and drawing some walks. There's a lot of raw power in his left-handed swing that he hasn't always tapped into, and it could be plus when all is said and done if he can hit enough to get to it.  Jenista played first and right field at Wichita State and showed he could do a capable job in center field in the Cape.

That nearly unprecedented velocity for his age obviously garnered a lot of attention in the scouting community, though he was, as you'd guess, still very raw and often had 20 control when he was scraping triple digits. Gaston also isn't classically projectable in that his velocity is already at the top of the scale and he has a maturely-built frame at 6-foot, but he did some arm slot and arm action tinkering over the last few years that has affected his control and command. So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot (more mid-90s velocity), where his arm action is also more naturally online than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Victor Victor Mesa workout in Marlins Park where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience. His best off-speed pitch is a solid average curveball and he also has a changeup that flashes average, so the full stuff package, beyond just the fastball, is also top of the scale elite, but Gaston is also hard to project given the varied looks he's given scouts over the last year.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","","50","\"2018 J2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"40.0\"","\"51.7\"","","\"|\"","1.5000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","30","60","45","45","","","","45","70","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["706","703","787","1047","667","\"43.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"48.4\"","\"47.8\"","\"48.4\"","\"|\"","\"Tyrone\"","\"Taylor\"","2019","\"25.4\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","154","621438","","","\"sa657979\"","\"|\"","","\"Torrance HS (CA)\"","1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"y2EErqiSPmY\"","","\"Taylor's performance tapered off in 2014 and he spent several years slugging about .330, then spent much of 2017 injured.

High, Taylor was selected by the Brewers in the second round of the 2012 Draft and signed for $750,000. He made his full-season debut the following year and paced the Florida State League with 36 doubles while stealing 22 bases as a 20-year-old in '14. The move up to Double-A proved a challenge for Taylor, and he regressed further in his return to the Southern League in '16. He re-tooled his swing that offseason and looked like a different hitter in '17 when he returned from a hamstring injury in June. Advancing to Triple-A last season, Taylor put himself back on the big league radar with a breakout offensive performance that earned him a spot on Milwaukee's 40-man roster in November.   Taylor is both athletic and toolsy, with an overall feel for the game that has long impressed evaluators given his multi-sport background. While he's always shown solid hitting ability thanks to a combination of bat speed and advanced bat-to-ball skills, leading to solid batting averages, Taylor had never hit double-digit home runs in a single season until 2018, when he delivered 20 bombs in his first Triple-A campaign. The significant uptick in power was a product of Taylor's revamped swing, as he attacked the ball at a better angle and hit the ball in the air more consistently than at any other point in his career.   Taylor is an above-average runner but doesn't steal as many bases as he once did. His speed still serves him well across all three outfield spots, however, and he's long been praised by club officials for his instincts and range.

He was a 40th rounder from high school who went undrafted his first year at a junior college, then was a 7th rounder in his second year. Nick has done nothing but perform since entering pro ball and scouts have noticed, hanging average or better grades on four of his tools, with power still lagging behind a bit. The likely upside here is a good utility player, but the gap between that and a low-end regular is usually a good swing or approach adjustment.

Older brother Phil was a 20th-round pick of the Padres in 2015 and has spent the last two years pitching out of their big league bullpen. Nick was a 40th-round pick out of high school in the same Draft as his brother and after a year at Eastern Illinois, transferred to Lincoln Land Community College. A huge season there landed him in the seventh round of the 2017 Draft and he had a solid, albeit unspectacular, first full season in 2018 that included a South Atlantic League All-Star nod.  Maton has the chance to have four at least average tools. As a legitimate 6-foot-2 infielder, the easy thing to say is he won't be able to stay at shortstop long-term, but the Phillies haven't seen any reason why he can't, with his hands, arm, accuracy and footwork all working well from the premium position. He has a solid approach at the plate, with the ability to work counts, and while there isn't a ton of over-the-fence-power, he can drive the ball from the left side of the plate.  If Maton can continue to develop offensively and gets to be a Major League average hitter, he's at least a solid utility type in the big leagues, and he did play a few games at second in 2018.

He might suddenly start hitting for more game power with a small change in that regard. Though just 19, Abreu has already added a lot of good weight since signing.

Having added strength to his projectable frame since signing, Abreu now looks like a player who might be able to hit for both average and power from the right side of the plate. Though he's considered to be an aggressive hitter, Abreu has impressed Brewers club officials with his feel for the strike zone and willingness to work deep at-bats. The same can be said about his ability to hit to all fields while flashing raw power.   On defense, Abreu has a solid arm and the defensive actions to stay in center field.

He's so young that he wasn't even eligible to sign on July 2nd because he was still 15. Were he a domestic high schooler, he wouldn't be draft eligible until 2020, when he'd be just shy of 18.

The teenager was considered one of the premier defenders on the market, and those tools are projected to improve as Garcia matures and his body develops. He'll also eventually be an average runner. At the plate, Garcia is not considered a \"big power guy,\" but the belief is that he will build on his doubles and gap power. Scouts also like his hitting mechanics -- the way his hands and lower half work in during his swing -- and his approach at the plate.  There's a belief that Garcia will hit 10-12 home runs in the big leagues one day, but it will be his glove more than his bat that will propel him through the Minor Leagues and make him an everyday player.

At his best, Hansen will sit 94-97 early in starts and both his breaking balls will be plus. Last year his velo was down, sometimes into the upper-80s.

After signing for $1.2 million and making some simple mechanical adjustments, he dominated in his first two pro seasons and led the Minors in strikeouts (191 in 141 1/3 innings) while reaching Double-A in his first full year. His 2018 was a disaster, however, as he missed the first two months with forearm soreness and wasn't the same pitcher when he returned.  When he's right, Hansen has a 94-99 mph fastball with running action and downhill plane, as well as a pair of power breaking balls in a curveball with 12-to-6 break and a slider with late tilt. Last year, his mechanics deteriorated and he dipped into the upper-80s at times with his fastball while losing sharpness with his curve and slider. He still showed glimpses of an average changeup, though it's clearly his fourth pitch and requires more refinement.  Hansen's walk rate more than tripled from 3.3 per nine innings in his first two years as a pro to 10.3 in 2018. Though Chicago has somewhat cleaned up his delivery, he still throws with effort and struggles to keep all the moving parts in his 6-foot-7 frame in sync.

His full-season debut came the next year, and while he pitched well overall, the D-backs had him repeat the Class A level in '17. The additional time developing in the low Minors paid off for Vargas in 2018, when he reached Double-A in August after leading the California League in ERA (2.50) and strikeouts (140).  Vargas' fastball works in the 90-94 mph range, but the pitch has a higher effective velocity due to a high spin rate that helps him miss bats within the zone. His slider and changeup continue to improve and are regarded as at least average pitches. The latter is currently ahead of the former, but he has feel for mixing both offerings. Overall, Vargas proved tougher to hit (.229 BAA), struck out batters at a career-best clip (10.6 K/9) and lowered his walk rate (3.1 BB/9) across two levels in 2018.

The toolsy outfielder went back there in 2017 and played his way to the Appalachian League in a big step forward, then after struggling out of the gate during his full-season debut in 2018, played very well down the stretch in the Midwest League.  More than anything, it seems that Baddoo took a while to adjust to the cold climate in Cedar Rapids at the start of the 2018 season and his bat warmed up as the weather did. He continued to show elite-level walk rates, he finished fourth in the league in free passes last year, and though his strikeout rate also jumped up, he made much more consistent contact in the second half. His extra-base authority continues to show up more and he could approach average power when all is said and done. He also has outstanding speed, which allows him to steal bases, not to mention leg out the league-leading 11 triples he had in '18.

France spent three seasons there before he was selected in the 34th round of the 2015 Draft and signed for $100,000 to play with the Padres. His bat worked at San Diego State, and his bat worked instantly in the Minor Leagues as well.   France made the leap from Class A Fort Wayne to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore during his first full professional season in 2016. He impressed with his ability to reach base - at a .387 clip that year - but he did so without much power. The same held true in '17 when he made the jump to Double-A. But in '18, France's home-run potential - which was always there, given his muscular build and his quick bat - finally took shape. He tied for the system lead with 22 home runs between Double-A and Triple-A.   The 6-foot third baseman is unlikely to wow with his glove (and with Manny Machado in San Diego, he might need to find a different spot or two on the diamond). But France's compact right-handed swing and his savvy at the plate make him an enticing hitter with big league potential.

While Garcia isn't as high profile as Gerrit Cole or Griffin Canning, he has built off an All-Star turn in the Cape Cod League last summer to post a very strong showing as the ace of a staff for one of the best college teams in the nation.  With four solid pitches at his disposal, Garcia fits the profile as a future starting pitcher. While his fastball sits in the 90-93 mph range, he gets swings and misses on the pitch thanks to good deception and riding life with solid spin rates. His slider will flash plus, a power breaking ball he throws 83-86 mph with good two-plane break. He also has feel for an excellent changeup, and while his curve is clearly his fourth pitch right now, it is distinct from his slider and he'll throw it with good depth at times. Garcia fills up the strike zone and could have future plus command.  While he's not the biggest guy in the world, there is a history for guys throwing a bit harder once they leave UCLA and enter the pro game. Even without that velocity jump, Garcia's arsenal, feel for pitching and clean arm action all point to a future as a No. 4 type starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TEX\"","","27","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (TEX)\"","\"|\"","122","50","\"TEX\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"43.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"|\"","0.0000","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","50","40","45","50","","","50","50","45","50","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","55","50","55","","","","55","","",""],["717","714","594","664","350","\"43.7\"","\"43.9\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jhailyn\"","\"Ortiz\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1076","665560","","","\"sa920180\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","\"HQy76_5oRQc\"","","\"Ortiz is a prospect of extremes: he signed for $4 million at age 16, and had 70 raw power as a 15-year-old (some scouts call it an 80 now) when he weighed around 250 lbs.

He made his pro debut in the United States, holding his own in the Gulf Coast League in '16, then broke out with an All-Star campaign in the Short-Season New York-Penn League the following summer. A move to full-season ball in '18 did not go as well, as his approach regressed especially in the second half.  Ortiz's calling card, his raw power, is still very much there, and it can get at least a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. The question has become whether he'll hit enough to tap into that power consistently enough. At times in 2018, it all clicks and he doesn't swing at pitches out of the zone. At others, he appears to have no plan at all at the plate. He continues to show he's athletic enough to play an outfield corner, showing a plus arm at times.  Ortiz's true value lies in his bat and how it develops. If he can find a level of consistency and come close to being an average hitter, then his power will show up in games on a regular basis, giving him the chance to be an every day run producer in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","\"A+\"","19","\"2015 J2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","11","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"39.1\"","\"51.8\"","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","70","30","40","60","45","60","80","20","45","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","60","40","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SD\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["718","715","578","665","521","\"43.7\"","\"44.0\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.2\"","\"47.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","\"Christopher,Chris\"","\"Shaw\"","2019","\"25.6\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"226\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1536","622046","","17738","\"sa658778\"","\"|\"","","\"Boston College\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","","","\"Shaw is one of many whiff-heavy corner bats with huge power who floats around the upper levels of the minors, putting up big power numbers while struggling to find a big league role if their parent club has someone at 1B/DH. The Giants have tried Shaw in the outfield but scouts don't think he's playable out there. Shaw has the advantage of hitting left-handed, but unless the Giants make a concerted effort to give him reps soon (they demoted him to Double-A to start 2019, so not a great sign) he'll probably bounce around on waivers until a team with 40-man space -- and the time to see whether or not Shaw can hit big league pitching -- gives him a chance.

He has lived up to his reputation since signing for $1.5 million as the 31st overall choice, topping the short-season Northwest League with 12 homers in his pro debut and the entire organization (Majors and Minors) with 24 blasts in 2017 and 25 last season. His first big league homer traveled 468 feet off Seung Hwan Oh in September.   Shaw has plenty of strength and leverage in his massive 6-foot-3 frame, giving him huge natural power to all fields. He could hit home runs without trying but sells out too much for power, letting his left-handed swing get too long and chasing pitches out of the strike zone. His whiff rate has jumped from 20 percent in Double-A to 32 percent in Triple-A to 37 percent in his first taste of the Majors, and he's unlikely to hit for much of an average unless he forces pitchers to challenge him more.  Mostly a right fielder at Boston College, Shaw broke into pro ball as a first baseman and made himself into an average defender. With Brandon Belt ensconced there in San Francisco, the Giants shifted Shaw to left field in early 2017.

After a nondescript pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, the Venezuela native moved stateside in 2018 and promptly raked to the tune of .413/.455/.652 in the Gulf Coast League, earning a promotion to the Appalachian League after his first 23 games.   Moreno's knack for making hard contact is a product of his outstanding hand-eye coordination and his preternatural feel for getting the barrel to the ball. He's cognizant of those strengths to a fault at times, as he'll often attack pitches outside of the zone simply because he can reach them. At the same time, Moreno neither strikes out nor walks all that often. There's enough juice in his bat to safely project double-digit home run totals, though his profile likely will be hit-over-power.   Defensively, Moreno impresses club officials with his athleticism and energy behind the plate, and they believe he has a chance to stay there long term. His arm strength is average but plays up because he has solid catch-and-throw skills which culminate with a quick release. Like any young catcher, he has a ways to go with his blocking and receiving, but all the ingredients are there for Moreno to develop into a big league backup, perhaps even a regular.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"A\"","17","\"2016 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"34.1\"","\"48.2\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","30","45","45","40","55","50","45","50","40","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","40","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["720","717","812","650","751","\"43.6\"","\"42.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"47.9\"","\"34.2\"","\"49.2\"","\"|\"","\"Ji-Hwan\"","\"Bae\"","2019","\"19.8\"","\"SS\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2352","678225","","","\"sa3006895\"","\"|\"","","\"South Korea\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","","","\"Bae originally agreed to terms with the Braves, but that contract was never approved as the deal was voided as part of the sanctions for Atlanta's international indiscretions.

Scouts in the Pacific rim likened Bae's skills to those of Hak-Ju Lee, as Lee was also a speedy, contact-oriented shortstop at this age. Bae posts 60 and sometimes 70- grade run times from home to first and has advanced contact skills, with a swing familiar to many in Japan's NPB. There isn't much strength or power to his offensive game. An interesting aspect of Bae's development will be his transition from largely turf infields in Korea to grass and dirt in America. His arm appears to be below-average at times due to a quick-flip throwing motion. It was fine for first basemen in Korea to field balls on a clean hop of the turf, but it's not ideal for pro ball here in the States.

The Pirates had some extra international bonus money, courtesy of the Andrew McCutchen trade, and were able to bring Bae into the fold for $1.2 million in December. He had a strong professional debut in the Gulf Coast League, but that was clouded when, in October, he was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend in Korea.  Bae has the chance to have a very good hit tool thanks to excellent hand-eye coordination. That's a blessing and a curse, because while he rarely strikes out, he showed a propensity to swing at everything to make contact. The Pirates are having the left-handed-hitting shortstop focus on zoning better, so he can find better pitches to drive and so he won't get exposed by better breaking stuff as he moves up the ladder. There is some impact to unlock with his swing, he uses his body well, so there should be some power in the future. At least a plus runner, Bae should have the ability to steal bases as well.  Defensively, Bae has the makings of a solid shortstop, with good hands and enough arm. He gets out of control fundamentally at times, leading to more errors than necessary.

Three decades later, his son Jonathan went to his alma mater and pitched his way into the second round of the Draft, the last of five college arms the Royals took in 2018. He made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Pioneer League, but was shut down a bit early because of fatigue following a long college season.  Bowlan didn't get the chance to show the true version of who he was during his pro debut and the Royals are excited to see what the 6-foot-6, 260-plus pound right-hander can bring to the table. At his best, Bowlan pitches well off of his heavy 92-95 mph fastball and can touch a tick or two higher with the pitch. He throws it with sink to get ground-ball outs. His low-80s slider will flash plus with good sharp break to it, though he still needs to work on the consistency of the pitch. He does have some feel for his changeup, giving him the chance for a third Major League offering.   Despite his size, Bowlan has a repeatable delivery and has shown an ability to throw strikes consistently. If he can continue to do that and refine his changeup, he has the chance to be a workhorse-type starter in the big leagues.

History is repeating itself this year, and while he may not go quite as high as Cody Reed did, Fowler has a better breaking ball at the same stage. He has backed out of a commitment to Mississippi, so he'll return to the Rangers for his sophomore season if he doesn't turn pro.  Fowler had a low-80s fastball as a Tennessee high school junior in 2017 and improved to the mid-80s as a senior before jumping to 90-93 mph at times as a junior college freshman. There were games when he operated more in the upper 80s, but he's still growing into his lanky 6-foot-5 frame and could sit in the mid-90s with sink once he's fully developed. He also shows an affinity for spinning a curveball, though he sometimes has trouble staying on top of it because he employs a lower-three-quarters arm slot.  Fowler also displays some feel for a changeup, giving him the potential for a nice three-pitch mix. He's still figuring out how to keep his long arms and legs in sync in his delivery, and he has trouble finding the strike zone when he can't. He needs a lot of polish but has more upside than most left-handers in this Draft.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","","23","\"2019 Draft Rnd 27 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","126","808","\"NYM\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Freshman\"","","\"|\"","","","","\"41.7\"","\"50.8\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.2500","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","45","40","","45","","","50","55","50","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","","","","","45","","",""],["729","726","629","652","625","\"43.6\"","\"43.7\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.5\"","\"48.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jake\"","\"Fraley\"","2019","\"24.0\"","\"LF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1748","641584","\"fraley_jake\"","","\"sa857756\"","\"|\"","","\"LSU\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2020","40","\"m2FL7vAG7w0\"","","\"Fraley went 77th overall in 2016, in the comp round after the second round. That's right around the range in the draft where the college hitters come with some warts and project more as role players than potential regulars. Fraley was a plus runner who projected in center field as an amateur but he has lost a step in pro ball and profiles as more of a tweener now, with offensive skills that don't overwhelm, so the outcome is most likely bench outfielder of some stripe. There's a shot he can stay healthy, add some loft to his swing, maintain some contact skills, and end up as a Ben Gamel-esque soft 50 FV for a couple seasons, but he's more likely to fall in the Jake Cave or Billy McKinney region where a swing change ensures a big league role.   Seattle acquired Fraley from the Rays, their best friend from trade camp, in the Mike Zunino/Mallex Smith swap this winter. Needs lined up, as Seattle was looking for cheap potential MLB contributors in the next season or two, and Tampa has a never-ending 40-man crunch to manage.\"","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2016, CBB (77) - TB\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 65 | Arm: 40 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  After three productive years at LSU, where he looked very much like a future center fielder and leadoff type hitter, Fraley was a Competitive Balance Round B pick of the Rays in 2016. As good as he was in college, he was tough to see as a pro, missing nearly all of the 2017 season and half of 2018 with injuries, though he did make up for some lost time with a dominant turn in the Australian Baseball League after the '17 season. The Mariners, who loved his speed and defense in LSU, loved what they did see when he was on the field and were sure to get him as part of the deal that sent Mike Zunino to Tampa Bay this past offseason.  One question facing Fraley when he entered pro ball was whether he would be physical enough at the plate. While he only got 225 at-bats in 2018, he showed the ability to drive the ball with extra-base authority, especially to his pull side. His legs and his glove are still his carrying tools and he has more than enough ability to stick in center field long term, albeit with a below-average arm. He has basestealing ability as well and should get back to wreaking more havoc when 100 percent healthy.  Controlling the strike zone and getting on base are still the keys for Fraley to profile as a top-of-the-order catalyst. If he can continue to impact the ball like he has at times, there's still time for him to develop into a big league regular.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SEA\"","\"AA\"","16","\"2016 Draft Rnd 2 (TBR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","35","45","55","50","40","50","45","45","55","55","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","65","40","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["730","727","630","435","1061","\"43.6\"","\"43.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"45.4\"","\"43.2\"","\"45.6\"","\"|\"","\"Connor\"","\"Wong\"","2019","\"23.0\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"181\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2027","657136","\"wong_connor\"","","\"sa873978\"","\"|\"","","\"Houston\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","42","","\" \"","\"An athletic, multi-positional player who spent his early college career at shortstop, Wong now sees time behind the plate, as he did throughout most of college, and at second and third base.

That, along with a few defensive flaws that may still be corrected with time, especially as he learns to handle upper-level stuff in the dirt, probably limit Wong to a unique kind of utility role or a backup catcher and infielder role similar to Austin Barnes', which is a bit better than just a flat 40 FV prospect.\"","\"|\"","","\"LA\"","\"2017, 3rd (100) - LAD\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  The Dodgers emphasize athleticism when they look for catchers, so Wong was an obvious target for them in the 2017 Draft. He started at shortstop as a Houston freshman before shifting behind the plate for his final two years before Los Angeles selected him in the third round. After hitting 11 homers in his first two college seasons, he hit 12 in his third and then 19 in high Class A during his first full year as a pro.  Wong displayed some wiry strength but used more of a controlled approach at Houston before turning his right-handed swing loose in pro ball. He aggressively looks to drive the ball now and does to all fields, though he'll need to make some adjustments after striking out at a 32 percent clip in 2018. He spent this offseason working to learn which bat path will give him the best production.  Wong has solid speed and is faster than most catchers, which will remain true even if he slows down due to the rigors of catching. He's agile and quick behind the plate, though he's still polishing his receiving and throwing because he's relatively new to the position.

He's long been projected as a reliever but continues to start in the minors, and he's had some dominant outings in addition to the low walk rates, and his spin rate has ticked up pretty significantly each of the last two seasons, which is rare.

At least in our longest stretch of in-person evaluation of Gutierrez, he has looked just okay at third base, and saw time at first.   The bat-to-ball skills are real. He's a career .286 hitter in the minors and has reached base at a .346 clip. A lack of game power probably means Gutierrez fits better in a multi-positional reserve role than as a regular at third or first base.

Gutierrez is the highest ranked of the trio, and the only one on the 40-man roster. Signed a bit older than most international amateurs at age 18, he's very close to knocking on the big league door.  Gutierrez has always hit from the right side of the plate, showing a knack for making hard contact to all fields. What hasn't shown up consistently yet is his power, but the Royals think there's more in there. Much of it has to do with his hitting philosophy. Because of his advanced bat-to-ball skills, Gutierrez would often catch the ball too deep in the zone and not get his bat head enough. There could be more over-the-fence power if he can find a better point of contact.  An uptick in power would let him profile well at third because there is no question he can defend there. He's more agile than you'd think given his size and he could be a plus defender with a plus arm.

Stoudt hopes to be the next, though an up-and-down junior season has made it a little tougher to pinpoint when he might get taken.  A three-year starter for Lehigh, Stoudt has four pitches that could work for him at the next level. He tends to sit around 92-93 mph and can reach back for a tick or two more at times, though his fastball flattened out a bit this year and was more hittable. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells well and throws with run and sink at times. At its best, it has downward rotation and fade to it and he can throw it to both sides of the plate. His slider is solid-average and he can land it for strikes, getting swings and misses with it against Patriot League hitters. In the past, his curveball has been a better weapon for him than it has been this year, though he has shown the ability to throw all four offerings for strikes.  The main concern about Stoudt is his size. The 6-foot-1 right-hander isn't extremely physical and while he does have some strength in his lower half, he does need to add more strength to offset worries about his durability over the course of a long pro season.

After a nondescript freshman year, spent almost entirely in relief, Marsh took a nice step forward as a sophomore with the Sun Devils. He then threw well during a brief stint in the Cape Cod League last summer and that has carried over to his junior season, where he has raised his profile as ASU's Friday night starter.  Marsh has four pitches, all of which he can throw for strikes. While he'll typically sit around 92 mph, he can get his fastball up to 96 mph consistently and throws his heater with solid cut and sink. His slider, thrown 78-83 mph, is better than his curve, thrown with more power and with the ability to land it in the strike zone and then out of the zone to get hitters to chase. He has feel for a changeup as well.  In addition to having four pitches which could all be Major League average when all is said and done, scouts love the way Marsh competes on the mound.

He was the only high school pitcher selected by the Astros in the first 34 rounds last year, and he joins Lance McCullers Jr., Austin Nicely and Forrest Whitley as the only prep arms signed from the top 10 rounds in Jeff Luhnow's first seven Drafts as Houston GM. The Astros limited Schroeder to 18 innings in his debut, having him focus more on getting acclimated to their organization and to pro ball.  Schroeder's fastball and curveball both have the potential to become plus pitches. He works at 91-95 mph and reaches 97 mph with heavy sink on his heater, and he shows advanced feel for spinning his mid-70s curve. He also flashes a sharp low-80s slider on occasion and has begun refining a changeup he rarely used as an amateur.  Schroeder has a sound delivery and repeats it well, which allows him to locate his pitches better than most teenagers. His 6-foot-2 frame is fairly mature so he doesn't have much projection remaining, but his present stuff and polish already give him the makings of a mid-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"A\"","28","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"40.8\"","\"51.7\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2200","2400","35","50","40","50","","","","50","55","50","55","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","50","","","","50","","",""],["736","733","536","436","721","\"43.6\"","\"44.3\"","\"42.9\"","\"48.1\"","\"41.2\"","\"48.8\"","\"|\"","\"Bryan\"","\"Mata\"","2019","\"20.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","250","6","\"|\"","2250","667356","","","\"sa917784\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","-1","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","\"WbkmD6xsGX4\"","","\"Mata's conditioning, velocity, and control all fluctuated wildly throughout 2018, and he ended up walking 58 hitters in 72 innings before his season ended in late July due to back tightness. That's not to say the industry expected Mata to perform. When he began his season at Hi-A, he was only 18 and the youngest pitcher in the league by a wide margin. He was sent to the Futures Game in July despite these struggles because his stuff is quite good. Mata worked more with a two-seamer in 2018 and his ground ball rate rose to 57%. His low, three-quarters slot creates movement on his changeup that pairs well with the two-seamer and also gives right-handed hitters a tougher look at his loopy curveball. He could have four above-average pitches at peak if you count the four- and two-seamers as two separate offerings, but none of it will matter if Mata's 2018 strike-throwing is the norm going forward. The consensus is that he has feel for creating effective movement on his pitches but not for locating them yet. Proponents think due to his age that Mata will improve and become a No. 4 starter. Detractors are skeptical of his athleticism, his ability to repeat and throw strikes, or both.\"","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","","\"Jan. 27, 2016 - BOS\"","2020","50","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50  Mata expected to sign with the Brewers at the start of the 2015 international signing period that July, but a groin injury squashed that deal and he wound up joining the Red Sox for $25,000 six months later. He won a championship as the youngest player (age 18) in the Class A South Atlantic League in 2017 and was the youngest pitcher in the Class A Advanced Carolina League last year. He was also the youngest pitcher in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game last July, though his 2018 season ended shortly afterward because of a sore back.  While Mata is still very much a work in progress, he has the potential for three solid or better offerings. He throws both two- and four-seam fastballs, ranging from 92-97 mph, and the late sink on his two-seamer helped him generate a 2.0 groundout/airout ratio last year. He sells his fading changeup with deceptive arm speed and scouts prefer it to his curveball, though he was significantly more effective against right-handers (.475 OPS) than left-handers (.860) in 2018.   At least 50 pounds heavier than his listed weight of 160, Mata still is learning how to adapt to his bigger body. After displaying advanced pitchability in the past, he saw his walk rate jump from 3.0 per nine innings in 2017 to 7.3 last year.

While there are questions about his defense, Burger was one of the top college bats in the 2017 class. He has quick, explosive hands that generate big bat speed, and he has unusual bat control for someone who swings as hard as he does.

Signed for $3.7 million as the 13th overall choice, he missed all of last season after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while running out a grounder in February and tearing it again while rehabbing in May. The injuries cost him a year of development but shouldn't affect his long-term projection.  Burger has the strength and solid bat speed to provide 25 or more homers on an annual basis, and he was working on making adjustments to hit more balls in the air after a ground ball-heavy debut. As a stocky right-handed slugger with some arm bar in his stroke, he has drawn comparisons to former Chicago third baseman Todd Frazier. He has a patient approach and a penchant for making contact, so he should be a better hitter than Frazier.  While Burger can look more awkward than graceful, he's a deceptive athlete who gets the job done in all phases of the game.

His changeup will flash plus and he can vary his breaking ball shape with a slider and relatively new cutter to give hitters different looks. All of these components allow Bailey to strike out lots of batters without big velocity, but his approach to pitching is not conducive to efficient strike-throwing.

He struck out in at least 30% of his at-bats every year since the Padres acquired him from Boston as part of the Craig Kimbrel deal. While his defensive actions remained enticing (they were, especially around the bag, some of the smoothest and quickest some scouts had ever seen), Guerra also became error-prone. He seemed a mess, a potential DFA candidate.   This spring, Guerra has moved to the mound. His first bullpen session, which took place in front of a very small contingent of Padres front office folks, was electric. The first fastball was clocked by Rapsodo at 97 mph, and a few fastballs later, Guerra touched 100.4 mph. He has been working, an inning at a time, twice a week in Extended Spring Training. Eric saw him shortly before publication, and he was 95-98 with natural cut at times (in the linked video you can see how his fastball's spin axis is somewhat slidery) and had pretty impressive slider feel for someone who has only been pitching for a few weeks. He'll likely head out to an affiliate in the next week or so (probably Lake Elsinore). Guerra seems comfortable and confident on the mound, and he's going right at hitters with that fastball. He'll move as quickly as his strike-throwing and slider allow him to, and San Diego has incentive to move him along because Guerra is on the 40-man.

His changeup was a work in progress, but as a short reliever, it's possible he can be just a two-pitch pitcher, though that would limit his value.

He was considered by teams in the 8-15 range because lefties this size who throw this hard are very rare, but there was trepidation regarding his age (he was well over 19 on draft day) and whether or not he could actually spin a breaking ball. The Marlins took the same route with Rogers as they had the year before with Braxton Garrett; Rogers didn't throw a single pro pitch in his draft year and instead was sent to Low-A the following May after a few weeks in extended. By that time, Rogers was already 20. He struck out a lot of hitters at Greensboro but was also relatively hittable, and pro scouts have the same issue with his breaking ball as some on the amateur side of the industry did, though it plays okay against lefties because of his lower arm slot. We think the changeup will eventually be Rogers' best pitch and it might have to be since right-handed hitters get a nice, long look at the fastballs coming out of his hand. We tend to think he winds up in relief or that he'll be undermined by several seemingly small issues if he starts, which combined will limit his effectiveness.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2017, 1st (13) - MIA\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  After spending the 13th overall pick and $3.4 million to sign Rogers out of a New Mexico high school in 2017, Miami opted to have him rest his arm that summer and didn't have him make his pro debut until late last May, when he had already turned 20.

Rogers has an imposing presence at 6-foot-6 and a better fastball than most left-handed starters, working at 92-94 mph and touching 96 with deception and command. His advanced age for a high schooler and his lack of feel to spin a breaking ball concerned some clubs in the 2017 Draft, and the latter remains an issue because he has trouble staying on top of his curveball and it tends to blend together with his slider. His tumbling changeup also lacks consistency but could be his best secondary pitch in the long run.  Rogers has plenty of raw talent but is only scratching the surface of his potential.

His arm slot and spotty college fastball command made bullpen projection popular, but because Heuer is a big-framed, cold weather (Colorado) high schooler who threw limited innings for two years in college, we're a little more optimistic about him improving. He had a strong fall instructional league during which his mid-90s sinker worked as an effective precursor for a good changeup. He doesn't have great breaking ball spin but at times his fastballs cut on him, and there might be a viable third pitch here that simply isn't a traditional breaking ball. He's likely a two-pitch reliever but in our estimation, there's room for growth because of the background. He could be a workhorse backend starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHW\"","\"A+\"","26","\"2018 Draft Rnd 6 (CHW)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.1\"","\"53.6\"","","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2100","45","55","50","","40","50","","55","55","55","","45","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["746","743","628","647","536","\"43.5\"","\"43.7\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.1\"","\"42.6\"","\"49.7\"","\"|\"","\"Dominic\"","\"Fletcher\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"RF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"69\"","\"188\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2888","","\"fletcher_dominic\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Arkansas\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2023","40","","\"Squatty, instinctive corner OF with power, some swing and miss issues.\"","\"Squatty, instinctive corner OF with power, some swing and miss issues.

A three-year starter in center for the Razorbacks, he was their best hitter at the 2018 College World Series, where they lost to Oregon State in the finals. As with his older brother David, an infielder with the Angels, his skills still stand out more than his pure physical ability, but those skills and his track record of production could get him drafted in the top three rounds.   Fletcher's best attribute is his play in center field. Though he's a fringy runner out of the batter's box, he's quicker once he gets going and has tremendous instincts that allow him to track down balls from gap to gap. He has displayed plus arm strength in the past, though it has played closer to average in 2019.  Fletcher has a power-based approach at the plate, and his strength and aggressive, pull-conscious mentality could produce 15-20 homers per season. He doesn't have the smoothest left-handed swing and he's a streaky hitter, but he makes consistent contact and should hit for a decent average. He has shown improved discipline at the plate this spring, though his offensive package may fit better for a fourth outfielder than an everyday player.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","","20","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","57","75","\"ARI\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.9\"","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","55","40","45","50","55","50","55","50","40","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["747","744","606","648","308","\"43.5\"","\"43.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"50.6\"","\"38.1\"","\"51.8\"","\"|\"","\"Daniel\"","\"Brito\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"2B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1851","660684","","","\"sa872732\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","-1","","\"High\"","2021","40","\"7t6ZJ3pwPzg\"","","\"So unpolished is Brito that the Phillies omitted him from 40-man protection in November and he went unpicked in the Rule 5 draft. The quality of his at-bats remains inconsistent and he has yet to have a strong full-season statistical campaign. But he's an above-average athlete with middle infield actions, a good frame, and very attractive left-handed swing. Solely on hand talent and defensive profile, we think Brito has considerable upside, but there's a chance he's just always a frustrating guess hitter. Brito will be the age of most college juniors next year and he's already had a taste of Hi-A. Were he a junior at an SEC school, he'd be the kind of talent that goes in the second round if he turns a corner during the spring and performs, and in the fourth round if he doesn't.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","","\"July 17, 2014 - PHI\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  The Phillies gave Brito their second-highest bonus of the 2014-15 international signing period, giving the infielder $650,000 to sign in July 2014. Pushed aggressively to full-season ball in 2017, Brito struggled there and had to repeat the level a year ago. After a brutal April, Brito looked much more like the hitter the Phillies hoped they were signing, earning a promotion up to Clearwater in August.  Brito hit .171 in April last year and spent much of the rest of 2018 digging his way out. The good news is he managed to do so, showing a hit tool that can be above-average and an ability to spray line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate. When he struggled, he got lungy at the plate and he needs to continue to work on being more patient and having more quality at-bats. He's never going to be a big power guy, but he is starting to add a little strength, which should allow him to have some extra-base authority.  While perhaps just an average runner, Brito is an excellent athlete and has good baserunning instincts. His athleticism, range and hands all point to him being a very good defender at second base.

His hitting hands are explosive but still pretty uncoordinated, especially from the left side of the plate.

After debuting in the Dominican Summer League in 2016, he made his United States debut in the Gulf Coast League the following summer. The Pirates aggressively jumped him to full-season ball in 2018, with less than optimal results. So in 2019 they sent Castro back to the South Atlantic League, where he's shown he's made some adjustments and started tapping into his power while handling multiple infield positions.    Castro's bat is his carrying tool. A switch-hitter, Castro has shown the ability to impact the baseball on a much more consistent basis from both sides of the plate. It's definitely hit over power right now and while he has been developing some strike zone discipline, he still has much work to do in seeing pitches, drawing walks and cutting down his strikeout rate. If he can do that, he has the chance to continue to show excellent extra-base pop, especially for his position. While he still sees time at shortstop, he's played three infield spots, with second and third base his best defensively.    The infielder will have to continue to show he can make adjustments and develop a better overall approach in order to hit enough to tap into that raw power, especially as he moves up the ladder.

He now sits 94-98 and has touched 100. He can alter the shape of his fastball to either ride or sink, and he will flash an above-average slider on occasion. He also has a well-below average changeup.

The Pirates noticed his size and his arm strength, despite his lackluster numbers, and took a flyer on him in the 29th round of the 2016 Draft. Moving to the bullpen upon turning pro, he's been able to pitch his way up the organizational ladder, beginning the 2019 season a phone call away in Triple-A.  While Harlieb is still learning how to pitch, he's also showing the ability to get upper-level hitters to swing and miss with a power two-pitch mix. His fastball sits in the upper-90s typically, and he's hit triple-digits at times, throwing it from a lower slot that makes it hard for hitters to pick up. With good life and sink on it, Hartlieb not only misses bats, but he also gets a lot of groundball outs as a result, with a GO/AO rate over 2.00 entering the 2019 season. He complements his premium fastball with a hard mid-80s slider that will flash above-average at times and will likely settle into the Major League average range when all is said and done.  Command does continue to be an issue for Hartlieb, and he will have to throw more strikes in order to be used in high leverage situations. Given his athleticism and relative inexperience on the mound, there's hope his control will improve the more time he spends there.

The redshirt junior has served as Elon's closer while also doubling as its starting right fielder this spring.    Adcock deals at 93-97 mph with riding life on his four-seam fastball, and scouts believe he could push triple digits once he focuses solely on pitching in pro ball. He backs up his heat with a low-80s slider that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. Some scouts have seen him flash a changeup but he rarely uses it in games.    The effort in Adcock's high-three-quarters delivery limits him to coming out of the bullpen. His control has improved in his second season of pitching, yet it's still below average and he'll have to throw more strikes to succeed against more advanced hitters.

We're skeptical of his ability to play shortstop due to below-average hands and actions, and think he probably fits best in center field due to his speed, but Cleveland played him exclusively at short last year. The lack of power likely means he maxes out as a utility man, so it makes sense to hand Clement a ton of reps at shortstop to see if he can improve, since ideally he'd be able to play there on occasion. He spent a lot of time with the big league club during 2019 spring training and made characteristically high rates of contact.

He reached Double-A 14 months after signing as a fourth-round pick.  Clement's simple approach and excellent hand-eye coordination allow him to put the bat on the ball almost at will. His compact, flat right-handed swing isn't designed for power and he focuses on getting on base rather than worrying about home runs. He has shown more patience as a pro than he did in college and has the plus speed to be a basestealer if he can improve his reads and jumps.

After a year-plus of letting him start to get innings and work on his stuff, the relief switch was flipped and Rainey took off, pitching his way to Double-A and earning a non-roster invite to big league Spring Training. And while he opened the 2018 season in Triple-A, Rainey was up in the Major Leagues making his debut less than a week later. After the season, Rainey was traded to the Nationals for Tanner Roark.  Rainey has always had elite-level power stuff and it really played up once he was pitching in shorter stints. Going right after hitters suits him, and his fastball-slider combination led to a ridiculous 15.1 K/9 rate in 2017. His fastball registers in the 98-100 mph range out of the bullpen, and his hard slider is a big-time swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup will never be fantastic, but he does use it against left-handed hitters on occasion.  The biggest thing holding Rainey back is his command. He's walked 5.3 per nine in his career, and issued 12 walks over seven innings in eight outings with the Reds. He has closer stuff and the mentality to handle the job, but he'll need to find the strike zone a bit more consistently to get a chance to do it in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"MLB\"","12","\"2015 Draft Rnd 2 (CIN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","18","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.2\"","\"48.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","1.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2400","2600","35","65","40","","55","","","40","70","40","","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","40","","60","","","","40","","",""],["755","752","721","1029","428","\"43.4\"","\"43.2\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.7\"","\"46.2\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Josh\"","\"Green\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2753","681401","","","\"sa3006701\"","\"|\"","","\"Southeastern Louisiana\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","40","\"ga8iyYVUctQ\"","","\"Green was a 14th round senior sign last year and like most senior signs, had 45/50 stuff in college.

The Dbacks may have found something here, though there's no way to be sure if the velo uptick will hold water or not.

He took well to the new role, showing improved pitchability and control, so much so that the D-backs made Green their 14th-round pick that June before signing him for $5,000. He garnered All-Star honors as a reliever in the Pioneer League in his pro debut, posting a 1.09 ERA over 25 appearances, then opened his first full season as a member of Class A Advanced Visalia's starting rotation.   Green stands out most for his ability to execute a low- to mid-90s sinker that he used to induce groundballs at near 68-percent clip in his pro debut. That combination of velocity and heavy life makes him difficult to barrel, let alone take deep. While scouts tend to prefer his curveball to his slider, they also generally agree that the latter has room to improve. Green rounds out his four-pitch mix with a fading changeup in the mid-80s that he throws to both sides of the plate.   As a physically durable right-hander who generates a lot of weak grounders and is generally around the zone, Green has many of the components needed to stick as a starter. That he's still relatively new to starting gives him untapped potential in the role, too, and the hope is that he'll begin to miss more bats as he refines his secondary pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"A+\"","23","\"2018 Draft Rnd 14 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"46.4\"","\"51.4\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2050","2500","45","50","45","45","50","","","50","50","55","50","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","55","45","","","","50","","",""],["756","753","648","642","720","\"43.4\"","\"43.6\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.1\"","\"45.6\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Lane\"","\"Thomas\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1187","657041","","16939","\"sa828962\"","\"|\"","","\"Bearden HS (TN)\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","\"qMOaTp9R6lk\"","","\"In 2017, the Cardinals traded away some of their International pool space for minor leaguers, including Thomas, who had a breakout 2018 at the plate.

He played some second base, third base and outfield for the Jays before moving off the dirt entirely in 2017. Thomas has struggled intermittently to stay healthy and to hit.

He responded by having a breakout year, playing across two levels of the upper Minors en route to a spot on St. Louis' 40-man roster.  Thomas has long had solid all-around tools with plus instincts that allow them to play up. He has a simple approach at the plate and tapped into the raw power he'd shown since high school by standing a little more upright and making his feet a little more narrow in his setup. He finished with a system-best 27 home runs, blowing well past the cumulative total (18) from his first four seasons. Thomas has plus speed and excellent instincts on the basepaths, though he has to learn to be more efficient when stealing bases. His speed and instincts help him in the outfield, where he's above-average in center field and has more than enough arm to handle a corner spot if needed.  Staying healthy was the key component in Thomas' leap forward in 2018, as he played a full season for the first time in his career. If things keep moving in the right direction, Thomas has the upside to be a 15 homer-15 steal-type of offensive performer.

He had a breakout 20/20 season at Hi-A last year, albeit as a 23-year-old. He has big raw power but there are questions about how readily he'll be able to get to it in games, and teams have varying opinions about whether or not he can stay in center field. Theres low-end everyday upside if things continue to come together at the plate the way they did in 2018. More likely, Thompson-Williams is a useful platoon at multiple outfield spots, or as a player who can provide some thump and speed off the bench.

The Mariners had always liked his tools and acquired him in the package for James Paxton last November.  DTW's power-speed combination has always been intriguing, but it's possible he tried to rely too much on his natural gifts in his first year-plus of pro ball. But he put in the work leading up to the offseason, which led to him producing 22 homers and 20 steals. He has serious raw pop from the left side of the plate, and he can drive the ball to all fields. If he can learn to control the strike zone a bit more consistently, he could make enough contact to have plus game power.

By that fall's instructional league, the Braves realized they had a prospect on their hands and acted accordingly, pushing Encarnacion to Low-A at age 20 where he put up a 118 wRC+ as an age-appropriate prospect in a full-season league, just two years after he signed for almost nothing. The change was simple: Encarnacion's projection and actions turned into tools with physical development. He now shows 60 raw power in BP, above average arm strength and bat control, and average speed. Encarnacion still has some skills that require growth, as his plate approach is too aggressive to work at the upper levels. And while he has the physical tools to play third base, he's error-prone. The raw tool package and quick-developing statistical performance are a rare combo, so Encarnacion and Cumberland headlined the Orioles' return in the Kevin Gausman trade with Atlanta last summer. It's not a stretch to say Encarnacion has the best tools of any Latin prospect in the Orioles' lower minors, but that's mostly because the Orioles have had a near non-existent international program and their three best international signees (Yusniel Diaz, Encarnacion, Jean Carmona) were all acquired last summer.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","","\"May 10, 2016 - ATL\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45    Signed for $10,000 out of the Dominican Republic, Encarnacion, at age 18, was slightly older than the typical international prospect when the Braves inked him in May 2016. Making his United States debut the next year, Encarnacion impressed in both the Gulf Coast and Appalachian Leagues, putting him much more firmly on the prospect radar, and he made a nice transition to full-season ball in '18. His performance and progress caught the Orioles' attention, and the club acquired him along with Brett Cumberland, Evan Phillips and Bruce Zimmermann for Kevin Gausman at the Trade Deadline.  A tall, lean and athletic player, Encarnacion oozes projection and upside. He's shown that he can impact the baseball to all fields from the right side, with impressive hand-eye coordination that allows him to find the barrel consistently. But after striking out nearly 28 percent of the time in 2018, with a sub-4 percent walk rate, he'll have to improve his plate discipline and pitch recognition to continue hitting for average. Progress on that front should also help him tap into his plus raw power, which is sure to show up even more as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame.   Encarnacion initially played some shortstop after signing, but he spent all of 2018 at third base. He's a raw and inconsistent defender at the hot corner right now, with arm strength and actions that give him a chance to stay there long-term. If that doesn't work out, a move down the defensive spectrum to first base is a possibility.

Scouts have him projected to third base and think he'll grow into significant power, but the hit tool projections are tepid. Teenage switch-hitters often have raw feel to hit since they have two swings to develop, so it's prudent to be patient with Antuna in this regard. He had Tommy John in early-August and is going to miss important reps. Non-pitchers only comprise 3% of UCL reconstructions and there isn't great feel in the industry for hitters' typical recovery times.

The Nationals landed the then-16-year-old with a $3.9 million bonus, setting a franchise record for an international amateur. Antuna looked every bit worthy of the high price tag during his pro debut, but struggled with a jump up to full-season ball in 2018 at age 18 before requiring season-ending Tommy John surgery in August.  The switch-hitting Antuna stands out for his impact potential at the plate. He does most of his damage from the left side, from where he exhibits preternatural barrel ability and a leveraged swing that produces hard contact. Scouts believe Antuna, who shows present pop to the gaps in games and good raw power in batting practice, could develop average over-the-fence power to go along with solid hitting ability. Antuna's plate discipline as well as his overall approach, however, will need to improve for him to achieve his offensive ceiling. Presently an above-average runner, he is likely to lose a step as he physically matures.  Antuna has the soft hands and body control needed for shortstop, but he's also prone to committing defensive lapses there, especially with regards to his throwing accuracy.

A move back to the bullpen allowed Jewell to focus on his fastball-slider combination. His hard, sinking two-seamer leads to a ton of ground-ball outs and he can also change a hitter's look with a four-seamer up in the zone that can touch 97 mph. His slider flashes plus and has cutter action to it. He had a changeup he was working on as a starter, but it's not as important in short relief.

Taylor's wiry frame is loaded with quick-twitch athleticism. It translates to good bat speed and better-than-expected power at the plate, with Taylor showing he can consistently impact the baseball. Those qualities, along with his feel for controlling the zone, give him a chance to be at least an average hitter, with power that should play in games more often as he becomes more physical and improves his pitch recognition and selectivity. A plus runner, Taylor's 44 steals in 2018 were good for a share of third place in the Midwest League, but he will need to improve his reads and jumps after he was thrown out 16 times, the second-highest total in the circuit.

Lange's changeup usage increased dramatically in 2018 and the pitch improved. His curevball doesn't have big raw spin but it's still really effective and remains his best pitch. His delivery is deceptive and enables his fastball to play despite below-average velocity. It appears there's a starter's arsenal here and Lange threw plenty of strikes in 2018.

As he reached the upper levels, that swing became untenable and needed to change. It did in 2017, when Williams opened his stance, utilized a big leg kick instead of an odd, double toe tap and began to lift the ball more. His ground ball rate dropped from 60% to 52% (which is still high) and he had a monster 2017 before regressing in 2018. Williams doesn't close all the way when he strides and he's become very pull-heavy and easier to pitch to. Other than the power, the rest of Williams' toolset is pretty generic, so he's going to have to hit a ton to profile. St. Louis has had success tweaking the swings of similar players in the past and Williams' groundball rate dropped to 42% after the Cardinals acquired him in the Tommy Pham trade, though that was only in a 76 PA sample. There's also an approach issue here as Williams really likes to swing. With Williams' power and pedigree, we'll continue to monitor him in case anything changes or improves, and if it does he could be a valuable role-playing corner outfielder. If not, he doesn't have the diverse skillset required to play a bench-only role.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2013, 2nd (52) - ARI\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 45 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  A second-round pick by Arizona in the 2013 Draft, Williams spent parts of two seasons in the D-backs' system before they dealt him to Tampa Bay in the November 2014 Jeremy Hellickson trade. Things started to click for Williams in 2017 at Double-A, as the then 21-year-old impressed with his feel to hit and power potential, but he was unable to build upon that success last year in Triple-A. He did, however, make his big league debut in July, logging one at-bat with the Rays, who traded him to the Cardinals 10 days later in the Tommy Pham deal.   Williams has always intrigued scouts with his natural hitting ability and projectable power, but it hasn't come together for him as quickly as it seemed it might earlier in his career. He has an aggressive approach and good bat-to-ball skills from the left side of the plate, and there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into. Right now, though, Williams makes way too much ground-ball contact -- he's posted ground-ball rates north of 50 percent in every pro season -- so a mechanical adjustment may be necessary to unlock his potential at the plate.  The D-backs moved Williams from shortstop, his high school position, to the outfield at the start of his career. He's become an average defender out there, spending most of his time in left, with average arm strength that enabled him to record 17 outfield assists in 2018.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","18","\"2013 Draft Rnd 2 (ARZ)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","13","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"45.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"45.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","40","60","40","50","50","45","50","60","40","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","45","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["771","768","662","637","719","\"43.3\"","\"43.5\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.1\"","\"43.7\"","\"48.5\"","\"|\"","\"Will\"","\"Toffey\"","2019","\"24.4\"","\"3B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2059","657780","\"toffey_will\"","","\"sa829401\"","\"|\"","","\"Vanderbilt\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2020","40","\"XL3eRFTCj3k\"","","\"Toffey was scouted heavily as a senior in high school as his teammate, RHP Austin DeCarr, went in the third round to the Yankees and signed for $1 million; Toffey was a Yankees' 23rd round pick, but he ended up going to Vanderbilt.

That changed in 2017, when Toffey's OPS jumped 424 points. He went from 0 homers to 12 and cut his strikeout rate by over 5%, all while continuing to show above average defense at third base. Since he was 22 years old during that breakout season and has only average raw power, some scouts weren't sold on Toffey's everyday potential, so he lasted until the fourth round where Oakland took him. Toffey was traded to the Mets this summer in the Jeurys Familia trade. He needed to perform and move quickly through the minors to stay on schedule to reach his everyday upside and he's mostly done that. Toffey will open in Double-A at age 24 and could get a big league look in late 2019 if he keeps hitting this way, but if he shows more corner platoon upside, as scouts expect him to, he'll work through some growing pains in the upper levels this year.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2017, 4th (111) - OAK\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Toffey was a standout in both baseball and hockey at Salisbury (Conn.)

Toffey controls the strike zone very well and shows power potential in his left-handed swing. He improved his walk and strikeout rates each year at Vandy and hit for more power than ever in 2017. He's been an on-base machine, but hasn't shown that pop as a pro, though the Mets believe he'll develop more game power by incorporating better use of his lower half in his swing. While his power plays best to his pull side, Toffey hit his most impressive home runs to left-center field last season -- an encouraging sign for a player whose big league profile at the hot corner depends on his power output. Though he's a fringy runner, Toffey provides above-average defense and plus arm strength at third base.  Toffey receives comparisons to Colin Moran as a left-handed-hitting third baseman who plays quality defense, gets on base consistently and has untapped potential with the bat. There is some question about whether he will hit for the average and power demanded of third basemen at higher levels, but even those who question his tools give him credit for his ability to process the game, his makeup and his competitiveness.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"AA\"","14","\"2017 Draft Rnd 4 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"42.7\"","\"49.1\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","30","50","50","50","70","50","40","50","50","55","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","50","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["772","769","647","638","553","\"43.3\"","\"43.6\"","\"41.4\"","\"49.0\"","\"40.8\"","\"49.8\"","\"|\"","\"Edward\"","\"Olivares\"","2019","\"23.2\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"186\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","2298","658668","","","\"sa832015\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","\" \"","\"Olivares was acquired from the Blue Jays in the Yangervis Solarte deal and has loud tools, with all but the hit tool grading above average.

The Padres' took note of a solid 2017 campaign, in which Olivares finally tapped into his power and launched 17 home runs between Class A and Class A Advanced. They acquired him in a trade for Yangervis Solarte the following January.   Olivares' upward trend continued, as he notched a solid season with Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore before an outstanding showing in the Venezuelan Winter League. He batted .340/.404/.479 for Aragua, and when the Padres needed to protect Olivares from the Rule 5 Draft in November, they did so without hesitation, placing him on the 40-man roster.  Wiry and athletic, Olivares stands out as much for his remaining physical projection as he does for his present athleticism and tools. He combines bat speed with a short right-handed swing to produce lots of hard contact, generating good extension through the ball and driving it to all fields. Scouts believe there'll be more power to come as he continues to add strength to his lean frame. But he could use a bit more plate discipline. Olivares boasts well above-average speed on the basepaths as well as in the outfield, where he possesses the necessary range for all three positions and a strong enough arm to play right.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SDP\"","\"AA\"","36","\"2014 J2 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","20","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.6\"","\"50.5\"","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","55","55","50","60","45","50","55","55","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","60","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["773","770","918","621","1133","\"43.2\"","\"42.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"44.3\"","\"39.4\"","\"44.7\"","\"|\"","\"Conor\"","\"Grammes\"","2019","\"21.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2979","","\"grammes_conor\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Xavier\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","\"Converted infielder is up to 99 mph at times with a plus-flashing slider, but an arm action and feel likely more suited to relief.\"","\"Converted infielder is up to 99 mph at times with a plus-flashing slider, but an arm action and feel likely more suited to relief.\"","\"|\"","\"Xavier\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/draft-2019-conor-grammes-rhp?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 40 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45    More of a power hitter than a pitcher in high school, Grammes won nearly as many Virginia state wrestling titles (two) as he pitched innings (three), and he received a walk-on opportunity at Xavier only after emailing the program. While he has posted much gaudier numbers at the plate than on the mound with the Musketeers, he'll definitely become a full-time pitcher as a pro. He turned down the Orioles as a 35th-rounder last year as a sophomore and should go about 30 rounds higher this June.    Grammes offers some of the best fastball velocity in the Draft, working at 95-99 mph as a reliever in the past and at 93-95 as a starter this spring. It doesn't feature a lot of life and he struggles to command it, so his heater can get hit when he leaves it over the plate. Similarly, he can throw some sharp low-80s sliders and also get into trouble when his breaking ball flattens out.    Grammes has shown little feel for a changeup while trying to incorporate a third pitch as a starter this year, and he'll probably scrap it as a reliever at the next level. Though he throws with some effort, he has made some progress cleaning up his delivery and has the athleticism to continue to improve.

His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and his slider is solid average, perhaps a tick above. But Mekkes is a gargantuan 6-foot-7, takes a large stride toward the plate, and releases the ball much closer to home than the average pitcher, creating a Doug Fister-like effect that allows his stuff to play up. He has a 1.16 career ERA in pro ball and has K'd more than a batter per inning. Like most XXL pitchers in their early 20s, Mekkes struggles with control, but hitters inability to adjust to his delivery in short stints has limited their overall ability to reach base. As a result, he has a 1.05 career WHIP despite an 12% career walk rate. Its hard to say how this rare type of deception will play in the big leagues, assuming upper-level hitters are still flummoxed by it as Mekkes moves on.

Since signing for $275,000 as a 10th-rounder that June, he has continued to put up crazy numbers in pro ball. He recorded a 1.16 ERA, .170 opponent average and 190 strikeouts in 147 innings while climbing to Triple-A during his first three seasons.  Mekkes has uncommon size (6-foot-7, 250 pounds) and a delivery to match. He hides the ball behind his body and then launches himself at the plate, giving him great extension before he slings the ball from a low-three-quarters slot. His fastball has average velocity at 92-93 mph but top-of-the-scale deception, and the net effect is that it plays as a well-above-average pitch.  Because his tricky fastball is his lone weapon, Mekkes is purely a reliever, though he can mix in a decent slider and changeup to give hitters different looks. While he has proven himself at every level but the Majors, he also has walked 4.5 batters per nine innings in full-season ball.

He signed for $550,000, forgoing his commitment to St. Mary's, then made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Bello makes consistent contact with a simple swing that enables him to use the whole field and leads scouts to project him as an average hitter. Adding strength should help bring out some of the extra-base potential in Bello's swing, but his game power likely will always be below-average. He has the kind of speed to steal bases and cover a lot of ground in the outfield, with the chance to be an above-average defender eventually, and a plus arm to boot.  Bello's bat and above-average speed could one day have him hitting atop a lineup.

His changeup has power sinking movement and should miss bats when Beede locates it competitively, but he's more consistently able to do that with his curveball. Fastball control likely keeps Beede in the bullpen even though he did have stretches this spring where he looked like a mid-rotation starter. He's 26, but looks like a strong three-pitch reliever.

He ranked as San Francisco's best prospect in 2017 and their top pitching prospect entering last year, then got knocked around in a couple of big league spot starts in April and went downhill from there. He pitched so poorly after returning to Triple-A that he moved to the bullpen in July in an attempt to simplify things.  Beede has experimented with a number of pitches throughout his pro career, going more with a low-90s sinker at the lower levels before favoring a four-seamer that clocks at 94-97 mph. He never has shown consistent feel for spinning a breaking ball and plans on focusing on his curveball and scrapping his cutter/slider going forward. His fading changeup is his most reliable secondary offering and can be a well above average pitch at its best.  Beede has the pure stuff to be a mid-rotation starter and outside of a groin injury that ended his 2017 season six weeks early, he has been durable throughout his pro career.

The Tigers took him at the start of the third round that June, signed him for $600,000, then watched as Clemens hit his way up to Class A Advanced Lakeland during his pro debut.

He worked to get stronger and to turn on and pull more pitches, increasing his game power without sacrificing his ability to control the strike zone and grind out quality at-bats. The power output is new, as Clemens totaled just 10 home runs in his first two years at Texas before erupting as a junior, though scouts do believe he could be a .260 hitter who hits 20 homers annually when all is said and done.

But Mariners scout Ben Collman liked his size and stuff, leading to his selection in the eighth round of the 2018 Draft. If his summer debut, which included reaching full-season ball, saving eight games and striking out 15.1 per nine, is any indication, the Mariners might have gotten a steal.  Gerber goes right after hitters with a two-pitch mix and an intimidating mound presence, thanks in part to his strong 6-foot-4 frame. His fastball was up to 96 mph at Illinois and he's now up to 95-97 mph as a pro with premium spin rate, with some thinking he could end up with a legitimate 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He backs up the fastball with a slider that flashes plus and he gets swings and misses with both pitches. Gerber's funky delivery creates deception, but it also leads to command problems. He'll have to continue to work on keeping his walk rate down in order to pitch late in games in the big leagues.  In addition to the stuff and physicality, the Mariners knew Gerber's plus makeup -- he graduated in three years with a degree in accounting -- would serve him well.

Sears. Signed for $77,500 out of the Dominican Republic in 2016, Then has successfully navigated two years of Rookie ball thanks to advanced pitchability. In his first season with his new organization, he led the Gulf Coast League in WHIP (0.98) and finished third in opponent average (.210).  Then doesn't miss a lot of bats with his 90-95 mph fastball because it's fairly straight, though that allows him to command it better than most teenagers can. He also throws strikes with a changeup that's advanced for his age. He has promising depth on his curveball, which ranks as his third-best pitch yet has solid potential.  Then isn't very physical, but he could make it as a No. 4 or 5 starter because he keeps his pitch counts down and limits his mistakes. He has a high floor and given the Yankees' success in increasing the velocity and spin rates of their pitchers, it's possible that he could develop a plus pitch or two as he matures.

This is the Cardinals' archetypical draftee -- a power-first prospect with questionable mobility. Collect enough of these and, through a combination of luck and good player development, some of them will turn into passable defenders and become solid big leaguers or tradable assets like Young, who was sent to Arizona in the Paul Goldschmidt deal.   Though he does most of his damage on pitches on the inner half, Young has enough barrel control to spoil pitches away from him until he gets something he can square up. When Young connects, he does so with power. Buff and square-shouldered, Young's physicality is a driving component of his power but it's also why he's somewhat limited defensively. Young has seen time at shortstop, third base, and left field as a pro but was mostly kept at second base in 2018. He should be a passable defender there, but his lack of defensive versatility could be a barrier to a call-up unless he hits enough to be an everyday player.

After two solid seasons there, he signed as a senior with the Cardinals for $3,000 in the 37th round of the 2016 Draft. He went from organizational filler to interesting prospect by hitting 17 homers across two levels of A ball in his first full season, then reaching Double-A in his second and hitting 21 more home runs. After impressing in the Arizona Fall League, he was sent to the D-backs as part of the package received for Paul Goldschmidt.  The stocky infielder is mostly all bat, but it's a good one. He's shown the ability to make consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate with at least solid average power. Young hits a ton of fly balls and showed his power by smashing a dozen home runs in Palm Beach in 2018, an extreme pitcher's park. While he doesn't walk a ton, he did cut his strikeout rate down considerably in 2018 and showed a much better overall approach in the AFL.  Young has seen time defensively at three infield positions and a little time in the outfield corners.

A switch-hitter, Pompey has shown the ability to do damage from both sides of the plate. His hitting ability stands out a little more than his pop, and he has a quick swing, strong frame and patient approach. Though he has solid-to-plus speed once he gets going, he's not always that quick out of the batter's box and has had just middling success as a basestealer.  Pompey's speed also doesn't play as well as hoped on defense.

After a modest freshman season at Creighton, he made a run at the Big East Conference triple crown in 2018 and continued to produce in the Cape Cod League during the summer. He has been streakier at the plate this spring, costing him a chance to join Chad McConnell (No. 13 overall in 1992) as the only Blue Jays position players ever selected in the first round.  Omaha's TD Ameritrade Park is one of the toughest places to hit a home run in college baseball, yet it hasn't been able to contain Robertson, whose short, quick left-handed stroke and strength give him some of the best power in the 2019 college crop. He lets his home runs come naturally rather than swinging for the fences, making repeated contact that could allow him to hit for average as well. To do so, scouts believe he'll need to get more upright in his stance like he was in the past before getting too spread out as a junior.  Robertson has below-average speed out of the batter's box but is closer to average once he gets going. He needs to improve his defensive instincts and his arm is merely average, so he could shift from right field at Creighton to left field in pro ball.

After a solid first season as the starting shortstop for the Cavaliers, Morris' All-Star turn in the Cape Cod League raised his profile, and he's continued to hit extremely well as a Draft-eligible sophomore.  Morris has a very good track record for hitting and most scouts believe he'll continue to hit for average at the next level. The left-handed hitter sends a lot of line drives the other way and controls the strike zone extremely well. Virginia's home park is not conducive to power, nor is Morris' current approach, but as he continues to learn how to turn on pitches on the inner half of the plate as well as fills out his 6-foot-2 frame, there could be more pop coming in the future. There's less belief in Morris' ability to play shortstop than there is in his bat. While he has decent hands and enough arm, he's not a runner, with most thinking he'll profile better at second base as a pro.

The Jays scooped him up as another legacy prospect in the system, but he was popped for PED's (ritalinic acid, a stimulant) in November and will serve a 50-game suspension to start 2019. At his best, Conine has 60 or 65-grade raw power from the left side, a plus arm that helps him fit in right field, and good enough contact skills for a 45 or 50-grade bat to allow him to get to his power.

Conine's power transferred immediately in his pro debut, as he homered seven times in 57 games in the Class A Short Season Northwest League after signing with Toronto for $1.35 million as the club's second-round pick. However, Conine's development will be on hold for the first 50 games of 2019 after he tested positive in November for Ritalin.  Conine had a rough first half as a junior but rallied later in the spring to cement his status as one of the better power hitters his class. He's capable of driving the ball out of the park to all fields by using a combination of bat speed, physical strength and loft he generates with his left-handed swing. Concerns about Conine's propensity to swing and miss in college were only exacerbated during his pro debut, as he showed very little selectivity while trying to hit the ball out of the park with every swing.

The likelihood of this is bolstered by the polished nature of Apostel's bat. His feel for the strike zone and his timing are both impressive for his age, and he is adept at attacking early-count pitches he can drive, while taking tough strikes. It helps him run deep counts and walk as well as hit for power. These traits are conducive to quick development, which means Apostel has a better chance of reaching the majors while he's still limber enough to play third for much of his first six big league seasons.

He's a left-handed hitter whose strength and aggressive, pull-oriented mindset give him plenty of pop to right field.

His swing has gotten a little more contact-oriented in pro ball, as was evident in his one home run and 12% strikeout rate across 175 pro games.

Jeremy was a solid prep prospect, but not the type who gets a big bonus and signs out of high school, so he ended up at Missouri State and had a breakout sophomore year. He was often seen by high-level decision makers during that breakout because he was playing alongside first round third baseman Jake Burger, and he had 2018 first round buzz by the end of the college postseason because scouts thought he could be a passable shortstop with all-fields power, and analytics folks liked his huge sophomore season and higher-than-you'd-expect exit velos.   Then Eierman had an inconsistent summer with Team USA and his draft spring was a bit of a letdown. He plateaued, arguably had a worse statistical season, and suddenly there were doubts about his approach and ultimate defensive home. He fell to Oakland at 70th overall last summer. Oakland has been a bit more open to non-traditional fits at shortstop recently and they clearly think that with more reps there, Eierman can stick. He may be a 45 hitter who gets to his raw power in games and passes at short, along the lines of currently projected mid-first-round 2019 draft prospect Logan Davidson at Clemson. Pro scouts think he moves to third base, at least, which makes the hit tool look a little flimsy on paper.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2018, CBB (70) - OAK\"","","2021","50","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 65 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  In 2017, Jake Burger became the first Missouri State hitter to be taken in the first round. After a 20-homer, 15-steal season as a sophomore that year, Eierman seemed sure to follow in his infield-mate's footsteps a year later. While Eierman hit 10 homers and stole 21 bases as a junior, his overall performance was more inconsistent, which meant he was around for the A's to select with the 70th overall selection in '18. He showed glimpses of his power-speed combination during his pro debut in the New York-Penn League.  There's little question Eierman has legitimate raw power from the right side of the plate, with both bat speed and strength. He got into bad habits as a junior when he tried to sell out for power too much, changing his impact as an all-around hitter. While he homered eight times in his pro debut, he also struck out more than 26 percent of the time with a low walk rate, and will have to improve his pitch recognition so he can tap into that power more consistently. While not a burner, he's an effective basestealer.   Eierman has every chance to stay at shortstop thanks to his plus arm, really good hands and quick feet. If he were to move to second or third, where he did see a little time during his debut, he could be a plus defender in either spot.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","\"A+\"","11","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","30","35","60","50","40","60","45","50","60","45","45","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","55","65","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["791","788","873","1013","469","\"43.1\"","\"42.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.5\"","\"43.6\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Dylan\"","\"Coleman\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","2458","","\"coleman_dylan\"","","\"sa3006957\"","\"|\"","","\"Missouri State\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","\"jA1AHBlXsqg\"","\" \"","\"Coleman is a muscular 6-foot-6 righty who body comps to NBA wing players like Andre Iguodala more closely than he does others in baseball.

Brito has enough range for the middle infield and magician's hands around the bag at second base, and while he lacks the max-effort arm strength for shortstop, he throws darts from second to first with a flick of the wrist. His ball/strike recognition is mature for his age and Brito has above-average bat control and hand-eye coordination, but the way his body develops is going to dictate much of what he's capable of doing offensively. He needs to get stronger to be more than a utility option at best. He's a switch-hitting middle infield fit with feel for contact, and that alone makes him one of the more interesting prospects in this system, but there's a sizable gap between where his physicality is now and where it reasonably needs to be for him to punish big league pitching in a meaningful way.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - OAK\"","2021","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  One of the top prospects in the 2016-17 international amateur class, Brito got $1.1 million to sign with the A's in July 2016.

It hasn't shown up on the stat line just yet, but Brito has the chance to hit from both sides of the plate, though he's a touch better swinging the bat left-handed. He's added some strength as he's matured and while he's never going to be a power guy, there should be the ability to impact the ball with some extra-base authority to all fields. Brito initially spent time bouncing between second and third, but it's looking more and more likely that second base is his long-term defensive home with an arm that's a little short for the left side of the infield. He could eventually be a plus defender, though right now he mixes in making the spectacular play with losing concentration and making needless errors on routine plays.  Brito will play all of the 2019 season at age 19, so there's plenty of time for his production to catch up to his potential.

He improved at the in each season and swung the bat particularly well as a junior in 2017, when the Pirates took him in the 13th round. He signed for $125,000, then turned in a solid pro debut on both sides of the ball in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. The Rays took notice and acquired him during the offseason in the Corey Dickerson trade, then sent him straight to the Class A Advanced Florida League for his first full season.   Gray has projection remaining to his athletic and lanky frame, and evaluators believe he's going to hit for power as he adds strength and fills outs. He flashed his power potential with a loftier swing at Charlotte in his first taste of full-season ball, totaling 53 extra-base hits including 13 homers and 38 doubles from the left side of the plate in the pitcher-friendly circuit. The uptick in power did detract from his feel to hit, however, as Gray crossed the finish line with a .238 average and a strikeout rate just shy of 23 percent. The Rays expect improvement from Gray on that front going forward, though, noting that he still fared well overall in the face of a difficult assignment.   The Pirates deployed Gray at the keystone to begin his pro debut, but by the end he was playing shortstop on an almost regular basis. He continued to see time at both middle-infield spots in 2018, and the Rays increased his versatility by working him in at third base. He's a reliable, if unspectacular defender wherever he plays, with good hands and actions as well as an accurate arm.

Rivera, a 19th-rounder in 2015, hopes to be the third. While he started his pro career slowly with the Royals, he took a strong winter league performance in Puerto Rico in 2016-17 into a very good full-season debut. He showed some more of the same in 2018, though he was slowed by a right thumb injury.  Rivera has shown that he has excellent hitting skills, drawing some walks and limiting his strikeouts. The one question is what kind of power Rivera will have. It started to show up some in 2017, but not a year later as he tends to open up on his swing, leading to softer contact the other way because his barrel isn't on point consistently enough to drive the ball. When he does make hard contact, it's to his pull side, and that's where his homers went in 2018. With better mechanics, he should be able to drive the ball to right-center and become a better all-around hitter.  With good hands, range and a strong arm, Rivera has all the tools to play third base long-term, and he improved his consistency there. If he can find his way to more extra-base pop, he could develop into a big league regular at the hot corner.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","\"AA\"","19","\"2015 Draft Rnd 19 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"39.5\"","\"48.6\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","30","50","45","45","55","50","45","50","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","45","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["799","796","702","616","690","\"43.1\"","\"43.3\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"49.1\"","\"|\"","\"Chris\"","\"Newell\"","2019","\"18.1\"","\"RF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"190\"","\"draft\"","160","4","\"|\"","2892","","\"newell_chris\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Malvern Prep HS\"","0","0","","","","40","","\"Northern prep bat has loud bat speed and power, had some contact issues over the summer.\"","","\"|\"","\"Malvern Prep (Pa.)\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/draft-report-chris-newell-of?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  There is a relative bumper crop of high school talent in Pennsylvania this spring, with as many as three prepsters from the Keystone State having the potential to go in the top three rounds of the Draft. While Jack Kochanowicz is the top pitcher in the state, Newell and Sammy Siani have battled it out as the top outfielders in the area. While Siani rates higher and has more polish, Newell might beat him in terms of raw tools.  At 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, the left-handed Newell certainly looks the part of an athletic outfielder and has shown glimpses of the tools to match. While unrefined, he does have good raw power with a swing that should allow him to continue to drive the ball. He will need to work on his overall approach and improve his feel for hitting in order to tap into that pop consistently. Newell has good speed that many feel could allow him to stay in center field, with some scouts thinking he has a better shot to stick there than Siani does, though others see a move to left eventually.  Newell hasn't always shown the ability to use his raw tools consistently on the field, and there have been some questions about his effort level this spring.

He has been a revelation after joining the Wolverines as a junior, exciting scouts with his combination of tools and performance while winning the Big Ten Conference player of the year award.    If he realizes his upside, Brewer will have at least solid tools across the board. He has well above-average speed and plus raw power, giving him 20-20 potential. He doesn't try to do too much at the plate, using his combination of a quick right-handed swing and strength to deliver hard contact to all fields.    A center fielder at Lincoln Trail, Brewer has played mostly right field and first base this spring because Michigan had greater needs there.

Johnson's special bat speed and ability to rotate are both evident to the naked eye, and he also has remarkable bat control for a player who takes such high-effort swings. But everything about his game is very raw and he'll likely require years of polish before he's ready for the majors. This is especially evident in his footwork in the box, where Johnson's stride length and direction are both highly variable. At times, this enables Johnson to turn on pitches on the inner half; at others it wrecks his swing's balance and composition entirely. There's also a wide range of potential defensive outcomes for Johnson. He may end up on the middle infield or in center, depending on how his body and infield actions develop, or possibly in an outfield corner. The good news is that Johnson was one of the youngest players available in the 2018 draft and he didn't turn 18 the middle of October. There's a lot of time for both him and the Marlins to figure this stuff out, and he has some unteachable talents (the bat speed and bat control) that could drive an offensive profile befitting any position if he transforms into a hitter instead of a swinger.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2018, 2nd (53) - MIA\"","","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Johnson comes from a baseball family, as his father Marcel played three years of pro ball and he's a cousin of Jimmy Rollins and Tony Tarasco. He works out with Rollins, who helped prepare him for the mental challenges of pro ball after the Marlins signed him for $1.35 million in the second round last June. One of the youngest players in the Draft, Johnson was still just 17 when Miami promoted him to low Class A for the final month of his debut. He's expected to miss the 2019 season after having surgery to repair a tibial stress fracture in his right leg in late March.  Bat speed and natural talent stand out with Johnson, who has the makings of being a 20-home-run player. He regularly produced exit velocities greater than 100 mph in his pro debut, though he also struck out in 28 percent of his at-bats and needs to hone his approach. He has average speed and the savvy to be a threat for double-digit steals.  The question will be how long Johnson remains at shortstop. He has a quick first step and enough arm to make plays there now, but his sturdy frame may eventually dictate a move to second base or perhaps the hot corner.

But his tools are arguably just as exciting, though more riskier. He's 6-foot-5 or 6-foot-6 depending on whom you ask and is only listed at 205 pounds, but is north of that and will get bigger. If he doesn't have 80 raw power now, he will in the next few years, and he's actually an average runner underway, though his first step isn't great and he'll lose a step or two with maturity. Garcia has the arm to profile in right field, but down the road, he'll likely be an average glove there at best. There's obvious leverage to his swing and he hit 10 homers in 44 games in the GCL as a 17-year-old, so it's not like he's sushi raw at tapping into his best tool. Dermis Garcia had similar tools at this stage, so that's one way this can go. Another would be former Tigers prospect Steven Moya, who played last year in Japan. There are also two massive corner outfielders with 80 raw power currently in the big leagues for the Yankees, so you know what Garcia looks like if everything goes perfectly, but a 42% strikeout rate in Rookie ball isn't the best starting place from which to get there.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"July 2, 2017 - NYY\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  At 6-foot-5 and 204 pounds, Garcia was one of the most physically imposing players on the 2017 international market when he signed for $500,000 as a 16-year-old Dominican that July. His body and reputation grew in his first year in pro ball, as he added 25 pounds and topped the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with 10 homers last summer.  A switch-hitter, Garcia is more effective left-handed but his gargantuan raw power is obvious from either side of the plate. He has an extremely aggressive approach and a naturally long swing, which resulted in a 41 percent strikeout rate during his pro debut. While it's easy to dream on his bat speed and strength, he's going to have to make much more contact to deliver on his power potential.   Though Garcia moves surprisingly well for his size, he already has lost a step since signing and could slow further if he continues to get bigger. He could become an average defender on either outfield corner if he works diligently on his defense and maintains his current athleticism.

The Brewers acquired him during the offseason in the January 2015 trade involving Yovani Gallardo, and he was moving quickly through Minors, pitching well at each stop, before regressing in his return to Class A Advanced in 2017. While the results weren't all that much better for Diplan in 2018, he still managed to reach Double-A at age 21   An undersized right-hander with a quick arm, Diplan will sit in the mid-90s when he's at his best, but his velocity tends to fluctuate from outing to outing, depending on how well he's repeating his delivery and whether he's staying on line to the plate. Those same mechanical issues also affect his slider, which can flush plus with devastating action but usually plays closer to average. His changeup has progressed enough that it's now viewed as his better secondary offering, receiving above-average grades from evaluators. Diplan has well-below-average control that has regressed with each season, and he posted the worst walk rate of his career (5.6 walks-per-nine) with a career-high walk total (74) in 2018.   Despite his inconsistent performance during the regular season, Diplan finished on a high note by striking out 10 and issuing two walks over six one-hit innings to lead Biloxi into the Southern League Championship Series. While it was the type of performance that offers hope that Diplan might still develop into a mid-rotation starter, the growing consensus among evaluators is that the right-hander will end up in the bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AA\"","18","\"2013 J2 (TEX)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"47.5\"","\"51.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2525","40","60","55","","50","","","45","60","60","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","","55","","","","35","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["804","801","548","379","1118","\"43.1\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.3\"","\"44.6\"","\"41.4\"","\"44.9\"","\"|\"","\"Zack\"","\"Collins\"","2019","\"24.3\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","258","6","\"|\"","358","641470","\"collins_zack\"","","\"sa738390\"","\"|\"","","\"Miami\"","-1","1","","\"High\"","2019","42","\"fK2DsmC5BT0\"","","\"We suppose Collins could catch on occasion, but he probably shouldn't be back there every day due to issues with receiving and mobility.

His 19% walk rate was among the best in the minors last year, and just 33% of Collins' balls in play are on the ground.

The White Sox loved his combination of power and on-base ability, and they bet the 10th overall pick in 2016 and a $3,380,600 bonus that they could refine his defense behind the plate. After three pro seasons, his strengths and weaknesses are quite similar to what they were when he turned pro.  On the positive side, Collins' combination of bat speed, strength and launch angle with his left-handed swing gives him prodigious power to all fields. He's willing to wait for a pitch he can drive and parlayed his patience into a Double-A Southern League-best 101 walks in 2018. He has significantly improved his game-calling since entering pro ball.  Collins' inclination to work counts and take hittable pitches also leads to strikeouts, as does his tendency to get long with his swing and become pull-conscious, resulting in a .234 batting average and a 30 percent whiff rate in his first three pro seasons. While he doesn't have to hit for a high average to be productive, it still remains to be seen if he can make it as a catcher.

While an inconsistent junior campaign caused Mendoza to last until the 11th round of the 2017 Draft, he rebounded to win the New York-Penn League batting title (.370 average) in his pro debut and then spent much of his first full season in Double-A, earning a promotion to the Texas League in mid-May after a red-hot start in the Florida State League.   Mendoza has a knack for barreling the baseball from the right side of the plate, where he employs a line-drive approach and demonstrates excellent bat control. He consistently hits to all fields, albeit without over-the-fence power, as he is much more focused on contact. Mendoza does have good strength, though, and the hope is it will show in games more consistently with experience. Mendoza has the chance to be a plus defender at the hot corner, with good hands, footwork and a strong arm, and he has enough range to play shortstop in a pinch. The Cardinals continued to increase Mendoza's versatility in early 2019, deploying him primarily at first base during Spring Training.

More patience has been needed as the talented left-hander needed Tommy John surgery after just three starts back in the South Atlantic League in 2018.  When healthy, Eusebio stands out for his feel for pitching and was much more advanced than most young pitchers just coming to the U.S. His above-average fastball and curve combination have promise, with his heater topping out at 95-96 mph with good sink and his breaking ball showing power and depth at times. His changeup should be at least average in the future. He has a very good feel for changing speeds and eye levels for hitters and isn't afraid to come inside.  Eusebio's rehab has gone well and he was progressing on schedule.

The Pirates had some bonus pool money left over and a good feel for what Kranick wanted to do, enabling them to go over the $100,000 pick value for a post-10th round pick and giving him $300K to sign in the 11th round. While his first full season was limited by some shoulder fatigue early, he did advance to full-season ball in 2018 and finished strong there.  Strong and physical, Kranick has the chance to have three usable pitches he can throw for strikes. He was up to 96 mph with his fastball in 2018, sitting mostly in the 92-93 mph range, using both a four- and two-seamer. What he profiles as in the future will be about how his secondary stuff continues to develop. The 6-foot-3 right-hander entered pro ball with a bit of a hybrid power breaking ball that's become more of a firm slider that flashes above-average. His changeup is still a work in progress.  The Pirates have managed Kranick's workload carefully, not sending him to full-season ball in 2018 until late May.

Indigenous to shortstop, Sosa began getting reps at second and third base during the 2017 Arizona Fall League, and he continued to see time there (66% SS, 18% 2B, 18% 3B) in 2018.  He hit .269/.314/.419 split between Double and Triple-A, a line that includes more in-game power than in '16 and '17.  At some point in 2017, Sosa added a leg kick that drove this improvement, but it didn't pay off in games until 2018, either because he added it too late or because the after-effects of a broken hamate were making his power. Additional evidence that this uptick in power is real is the change in Sosa'a ground ball rate, which has dropped from 50% in '16 and '17 to 38% in '18. Because he's such a free-swinger, Sosa will probably run pretty low OBPs as a big leaguer, but he has barrell control and his hands have life, so he's going to hit some. In the last year he's improved from a viable shortstop who might hit an empty .260 to a versatile infield defender with some pop, and he looks poised to play an integral big league role pretty soon. He's the best defensive infielder on St. Louis' 40-man.  \"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","","\"July 2, 2012 - STL\"","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 35 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  The Cardinals signed Sosa for $425,000 out of Panama in 2012 as part of a talented international class that included Alex Reyes and Magneuris Sierra. All three players have since reached the Major Leagues, with Sosa being the last of the group to arrive when he made his debut at age 22 in September 2018. The promotion tied a bow on what was a breakout offensive campaign for Sosa, whose development had been slowed the previous two years due to injury.   While Sosa always has shown an ability to make consistent contact and hit to all fields, power was largely absent from his game until 2018, when he implemented a leg kick and proceeded to establish career highs with 12 homers and 30 doubles. Sosa's knack for putting the ball in play helps keep his strikeout totals in check but also nets him few walks, giving him fringy on-base skills overall. He has average speed but is well-below-average as a basestealer, evidenced by his 64 percent success rate in the Minors.  Sosa does have defensive value, however, with the hands and enough arm to play shortstop on a regular basis. He improved his positional versatility by adding second and third base to his resume in the Arizona Fall League, and he saw nearly equal time at the hot corner and keystone in 2018 in addition to his primary work at shortstop. While it all seemingly points to a career as a utility infielder for Sosa, an everyday role isn't totally out of the question, especially if he can build upon the progress he made in '18.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AAA\"","8","\"2012 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","10","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"48.2\"","\"43.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","30","45","50","55","50","50","40","45","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","35","50","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["811","808","715","607","736","\"43.0\"","\"43.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.0\"","\"40.2\"","\"48.7\"","\"|\"","\"Drew\"","\"Millas\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2915","","\"millas_drew\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Missouri State\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","\"Milas is a catch-and-throw type backstop that made an offensive breakthrough this year, with some scouts seeing even more offensive growth.\"","\"Milas is a catch-and-throw type backstop that made an offensive breakthrough this year, with some scouts seeing even more offensive growth.\"","\"|\"","\"Missouri State\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-drew-millas-c?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>    Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 45 | Run: 45 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45    Missouri State is known for producing pitchers -- a dozen big leaguers selected in the last 18 years -- but also has had a position player selected in the top five rounds of three of the previous four Drafts. Millas should extend that streak this June, following Tate Matheny (Red Sox, fourth round, 2015), Jake Burger (White Sox, first, 2017) and Jeremy Eierman (Athletics, second, 2018). He rivals Baylor's Shea Langeliers as the best defensive catcher in college baseball.    Millas is extremely athletic for his position, flashing above-average run times and moving around behind the plate like an infielder. He has soft hands and excels at blocking and receiving. He also has a strong and accurate arm, the leadership skills desired in a catcher and calls his own game -- a rarity in college.    Millas offers some raw power, but he has gotten too wrapped up in trying to lift and drive the ball during a rough junior season offensively. He's a switch-hitter who's significantly better from the left side, and some evaluators wonder if he'd be better off giving up batting right-handed. Besides his swing-and-miss issues, there's also some concern that he's often nicked up with mild injuries, including a hamstring strain this spring and hip and shoulder woes in the past.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"OAK\"","","24","\"2019 Draft Rnd 7 (OAK)\"","\"|\"","65","224","\"OAK\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","\"39.1\"","\"50.5\"","\"43.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","50","40","55","50","45","60","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","45","45","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["812","809","716","608","702","\"43.0\"","\"43.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.2\"","\"38.8\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Josh\"","\"Smith\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"2B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"175\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2876","","\"smith_josh\"","","","\"|\"","","\"LSU\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2023","40","","\"Max-effort player with lift-friendly swing.

Those plans went awry, however, as a stress reaction in a lumbar vertebra limited him to just six games and forced him to miss summer ball as well. He has returned this season and been the Tigers' best hitter, playing his way into the top three rounds of the Draft.    Smith makes repeated contact from the left side of the plate, using the entire field and controlling the strike zone. He has solid raw power and drives the ball consistently enough to provide 15 or more homers per season. He has solid to plus speed and the savvy to use it well on the bases.    Smith also shows good instincts in the field, giving him a chance to stay at shortstop even if many scouts project him to shift to second base at the big league level.

He's too pull-heavy at times, or at least tries to pull pitches he shouldn't, ones he should just take.

The best of that group is Toribio, a Dominican who ranked third in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League with 10 homers in his 2018 pro debut.  Despite that slugging display, Toribio's hitting ability and approach may be better than his power. He shows good feel for the barrel from the left side of the plate and walked in 19 percent of his plate appearances in the DSL. He has nice loft in his swing, drives the ball in the air and could have 20-homer pop once he adds more strength.  Though Toribio is a below-average runner, San Francisco believes he'll be able to remain at third base and may give him a chance to show what he can do at second base.

The Red Sox found after signing him that he had an issue with his contacts, giving him particular trouble in day games (which all of the games at NHSI were), and got him squared away before his pro career began. Howlett hit six homers in 43 pro games with a manageable strikeout rate that surprised many amateur scouts who had discounted his hitting ability earlier that year.

After signing him away from a Florida State commitment for $185,000 in the 21st round, the Red Sox helped him find contact lenses that worked and watched him hit like the old Howlett in his pro debut.  Because he could see the ball better, Howlett made better contact as a pro than he did as a senior, and he also surprised Boston with a more advanced approach than expected. He does a nice job of keeping his right-handed swing compact and balanced rather than selling out for home runs. With his bat speed, and strength and loft in his stroke, his power comes naturally.

Milwaukee made the then-16-year-old Dominican outfielder its top priority, inking him with a $1.8 million bonus on July 2. He showed a high-risk/high-reward profile during his pro debut, hitting for power but also striking out at a high rate in the Dominican Summer League before heading stateside and finishing in the Arizona League.   The switch-hitting Ernesto has an aggressive approach from both sides of the plate that he will need to tone down in order to make consistent contact at higher levels. He's a superior hitter as a left-handed hitter and slashed .282/.328/.491 from that side in his pro debut, compared to .150/.227/.150 as a righty. Scouts generally think he has a chance to hit for power, at least from the left side of the plate, as he develops physically. An average-or-better runner, Ernesto shows raw speed on the bases and could eventually become a basestealer.  On defense, Ernesto has the speed and instincts to play center field, but like most prospects his age, he will have to work on improving his routes and angles to fly balls.

Mostly due to his huge raw power, he signed for what was then a franchise IFA-record $1.6 million, a mark that has since been shattered by Luis Robert. Adolfo's early career was mired in strikeouts and injury. He struck out at a 43% clip in his first season, missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, and then broke his hamate a month into 2016 and hit for no power after he returned.   While he continues to strike out at a somewhat troubling rate (30% combined over the last two seasons), Adolfo has performed each of the last two years despite playing through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018. He's grown into the power expected of him as an amateur and has slugged just shy of .460 as an age-appropriate regular at Low- and Hi-A. Back from Tommy John during the Spring of 2019, Adolfo looked buff, but stiff. The power is still there, but so too is the risk he ends up as a DH. One has to wonder if, through no fault of his own, the large swaths of inactivity throughout his career have led to an early tumble down the defensive spectrum. We still really like that power potential and are encouraged by the last two years of output.

MLB Pipeline's No. 2-rated international prospect that summer behind current organization mate Eloy Jimenez, he has seen his progress slowed by injuries. Ankle and hamate issues truncated his first two full pro seasons, he missed the last two months of 2018 following Tommy John surgery and played just 23 games this year before requiring arthroscopic elbow surgery that ended his 2019 season.   When healthy, Adolfo has made encouraging progress at the plate during the last two seasons. He's showing more patience and making more consistent contact, allowing him to make better use of his well above-average raw power. He's recognizing pitches better, using the entire field and understanding that home runs will come naturally thanks to his bat speed, strength, loft and leverage in his right-handed stroke.    Adolfo has the best outfield arm in the organization and had one of the best in the Minors before he got hurt, and it should bounce back after his elbow reconstruction. He moves well for his size and projects as an average runner and defender in right field.

Soto got a $1 million bonus the first time around, then another $850,000 from Los Angeles, signing along with fellow former-Brave and Venezuelan Kevin Maitan. It's a cliche in scouting to call a player a 'Venezuelan-style shortstop,' but Soto fits that to a T: smaller, without big tools, but with an advanced feel to play, and a gritty, high-effort style. He had about 30-grade raw power when he signed, and his exit velos were topping out in the mid-90s in the GCL for Atlanta, but he's now hitting a quarter of his balls in play in the 90s and looks like he'll be able to avoid being so weak that pitchers can knock the bat out of his hands. Soto is a roughly average runner with a roughly average arm, but both tools play up due to his instincts and strong internal clock, so he's a potential above average shortstop. He also has advanced feel to hit, with above average bat control and a self-aware approach at the plate. There's a road to a Jose Iglesias-type regular here, but it's more likely Soto lands in the utility range, with maybe a season or two where he's starting quality.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","","\"Dec. 16, 2017 - LAA\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Kevin Maitan might have been the marquee name the Angels picked up from the pool of former Braves prospects who became free agents when Atlanta was penalized for international signing violations, but it would be wrong to sleep on Soto. The infielder, who initially signed for $1 million with Atlanta in July 2016, got $850,000 in December 2017 to join the Angels, then went out and surprised many with a very productive organizational debut in the Rookie-level Pioneer League.  Soto showed an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, from the get-go in his pro debut with the Braves in 2017. He rarely struck out and drew plenty of walks, but didn't have much to show for it production-wise because of a lack of strength. By the time he reached the Pioneer League with the Angels, he had gotten much more physical, and while he's never going to be a home run hitter, the added strength allowed him to impact the ball more consistently to the point where some feel he could be an above-average hitter if he continues to commit to that part of his development.  While he played on both sides of second base in 2018, there's no question he can handle shortstop with a strong arm and terrific hands.

Elledge has a strong, durable frame and three pitches. He has a quick arm that consistently produces 93-95 mph fastballs with heavy sink that he can command to either side of the plate. Elledge usually throws his low-80s slider for strikes, and at times it can play like a cutter, with short, glove-slide slice. He shows some feel for a changeup but doesn't need it much in a relief role.

When he kept on hitting in the Arizona Fall League last fall, the Rockies added him to the 40-man roster.  Fuentes' offensive transformation began three years ago, in 2016, when he had to go back and repeat the South Atlantic League after a pedestrian 2015 season there. He made some adjustments and hasn't stopped doing so since, showing an innate ability to make hard contact. He's mixed in a leg kick that helps him stay back, allowing him to add more leverage and power. While he doesn't walk much, he also keeps his strikeouts low.  A very natural and easy defender, Fuentes is like his cousin with his terrific instincts at the hot corner.

As a Virginia junior in 2017, Smith walked three times more than he struck out en route to a .342/.427/.570 line. He also homered more than he struck out and finished sixth all-time on the Cavaliers' career home run list and second on their RBI list. After the D-backs took him with the No. 7 overall pick in June, he posted the Northwest League's third-best average (.318) but didn't show any over-the-fence power.   The power wasn't there for Smith in his first full season either, as he finished with 11 homers in 120 games in the hitter-friendly California League. He did, however, swing the bat better as the summer unfolded, hitting .297/.362/.432 over his final 51 contests. At his best, Smith rarely swings and misses and drives the ball to all fields well from the left side of the plate. But he got away from those strengths and become too pull-heavy in 2018, trying to force his power rather than let it happen naturally, as a product of his all-around improvements.   Going forward, the D-backs want Smith to focus simply on being a good hitter. But as a below-average runner who is limited to first base defensively, Smith's power will have to start showing up in games for him to profile as anything more than a bench bat.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"AA\"","28","\"2017 Draft Rnd 1 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"47.3\"","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","35","55","40","40","45","50","40","55","40","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","35","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIN\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["823","820","759","601","902","\"42.9\"","\"43.0\"","\"41.4\"","\"46.8\"","\"42.5\"","\"47.2\"","\"|\"","\"Owen\"","\"Miller\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","3079","680911","","","\"sa3006673\"","\"|\"","","\"Illinois State\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2021","40","","\" \"","\"The wave of teenage talent currently at Hi-A drove San Diego to push Miller straight to Double-A to start his first full season, and he's risen to the occasion, off to a pretty strong start, at least from bat-to-ball standpoint.

It's not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it's a pretty interesting skillset.

He also boasts a strong feel for the strike zone, even if he probably won't offer much power in the long-term.  Miller is an above-average runner but has gains to make as a base-stealer, where he needs to improve his reads and jumps. At shortstop, Miller boasts solid range and solid hands.

But Toro struggles to make throws from athletically challenging platforms, which leads some onlookers to question whether he's actually a good fit there, and his one-note, pull-heavy approach to contact may be less successful in the big leagues than it has in the lower levels of the minors.

He set career highs in most categories last season and continued to open eyes by ranking third in the Arizona Fall League in on-base percentage (.463), slugging (.561) and OPS (1.023).

Toro has a plus arm and reliable hands at third base, though he lacks quickness and has fringy range.

While McKay's two-way potential led to him being selected by the Rays with the No. 4 pick, Ellis, who had led the club in average, home runs and RBIs during the spring, remained on the board until the second round. The D-backs sent Ellis straight to the California League for his first full season, hoping that his advanced bat might not make him long for the level. It looked like that might be the case when Ellis got off to a strong start in the first half, but he tailed off the rest of the way, slashing .213/.306/.377 over his final 50 contests.   A physically strong right-handed hitter, Ellis has easy raw power to all fields and has shown some feel to hit from a solid approach. That he doesn't always utilize his lower-half led to too many inconsistent swings and weakly-hit fly balls in 2018, but the D-backs believe his swing is in better shape now after he addressed those inefficiencies. Ellis manages his strikeouts and draws his share of walks, though he does have a tendency to press and get away from his approach, especially as his struggles deepen.   Concerns about Ellis' defense out of the Draft had some thinking he'd eventually move to first. Instead, he's improved the most in that area as a pro, so much so that he's now regarded as an above-average defender at the hot corner, where his plus arm strength is a fit.

Celestino finished the rest of the summer in the Appalachian League and the coaching staff in Elizabethton felt he was one of the best defenders they've seen at that level. He has tremendous instincts in center field with an above-average arm, allowing him to play a plus center field despite not being a burner speed-wise. The bigger question is whether his bat can catch up to his glove. He has shown plenty of ability to make contact, but it's a more line-drive to the gaps oriented approach right now. Some of that is because of his swing path and some of that stems from his need to add strength.  Just 20 for all of the 2019 season, there's plenty of time for Celestino to grow into some power, and he has the bat speed to get there. If that part of his game develops, he could be a dynamic regular playing up the middle.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIN\"","\"A\"","21","\"2015 J2 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"34.5\"","\"49.1\"","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","20","35","60","45","60","55","30","40","60","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","40","55","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"TAM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["827","824","737","605","735","\"42.9\"","\"43.1\"","\"41.4\"","\"48.0\"","\"38.0\"","\"48.9\"","\"|\"","\"Hudson\"","\"Head\"","2019","\"18.1\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"175\"","\"draft\"","320","8","\"|\"","2917","","\"head_hudson\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Churchill HS (TX)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","\"Popup athlete has gap power and plus speed, with scouts racing in to get looks.\"","\"Popup athlete is now widely known and has gap power, some loft and plus speed.\"","\"|\"","\"Churchill (Texas) HS\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-hudson-head-of?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>    Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45    Because Head wasn't a regular on the showcase circuit last summer and didn't stand out at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in the fall, he barely registered on the radar of scouts.

Head has some arm bar in his left-handed swing, though he overcomes it with advanced feel for hitting. Wiry strong with good snap in his wrists, he has above-average bat speed and raw power. While his offensive potential is impressive, he has little track record against quality competition.    If Head continues to develop and improve, he could wind up with solid or better tools across the board. The Oklahoma recruit has plus speed and should be able to stick in center field once he improves his reads and routes.

In high school, he was your standard high risk, high reward corner power projection bat. A monstrous and athletic 6-foot-5 (there's a rumor Coach K offered him a hoops walk-on opportunity in an effort to get him to campus), Benson drew body and swing comps to Jason Heyward.   But as he has accumulated statistics in pro ball, he looks much more unique than his profile's bird's eye view would indicate. He strikes out 30% of the time, which is fairly common for prospects like this. But he incredibly only slugged .370 last year while still managing to homer 22 times, and Benson's ground ball rate is a minuscule 28%. He walked at an encouraging 16% clip last year. Still just 20, Benson remains a tooled up project with a huge red flag, but now has several underlying statistical traits of interest. He'd be higher on most other teams' prospect lists; we just prefer the ultra-young, up-the-middle guys in this system to a profile like Benson's, and Cleveland has lots of those.\"","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","\"2016, 1st (14) - CLE\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  Benson excited scouts with his size and power/speed combination leading up to the 2016 Draft, earning comparisons to Jason Heyward as an Atlanta-area high schooler with a similar build and athleticism. After signing for an under-slot $2.5 million as the 14th overall pick that June, he hit just .201/.329/.409 in his first three pro seasons. He led the Class A Midwest League with 22 homers and ranked third with 82 walks in 2018, but his .180 batting average was the second-lowest among full-season batting qualifiers in the Minors.  Benson offers massive raw power, the product of a quick bat, prodigious strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-5 frame. He's also extremely selective at the plate, able to recognize offspeed pitches and refrain from chasing them out of the strike zone. But there are mechanical and timing issues with his left-handed swing, resulting in way too many swings and misses at hittable strikes.  If Benson can solve his hitting issues, he would have some of the highest upside in the system. He's very athletic for his size, displaying solid speed and a plus arm.

He did more pitching as a freshman and junior, more hitting as a sophomore and senior. Now it appears he may do a little bit of both in the big leagues, as last year he stepped on a pro mound for the first time, touching 93 with his fastball, and showing an average curveball on occasion. He also had a breakout offensive season, though 13 of his 29 home runs came in the Cal League, which, especially at age 24, should cause some skepticism as to how much it reflects true talent. Walsh does have some power and he lifts the baseball consistently, so while he doesn't have a hit/power combination fit for profiling at any of the defensive spots he's capable of playing, he could run into some bombs in a pinch-hitting role. He's also a better runner and first base defender than is typical for his position and may contribute in those areas, as well. Walsh has an interesting, multi-faceted skillset and could be used as a Swiss Army Knife bench piece, if a bit of a blunt one, who allows flexibility on other parts of the roster.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2015, 39th (1,185) - LAA\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 50 | Run: 35 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Walsh had an up-and-down career as a two-way player at Georgia, serving at times as a lefty swingman and showing glimpses of offensive ability as a hitter. Taken with no expectations as a 39th-round senior sign, Walsh focused on his bat for much of his pro career. Playing mostly first base and a little outfield, he'd always hit well, then broke out across three levels and led the organization in RBIs and finished tied for the lead in home runs. At the same time, he started re-introducing pitching to his resume, showing some aptitude as a lefty reliever.  Walsh's raw power from the left side has always been intriguing and he started tapping into it consistently in 2018. There were plenty of strikeouts, but also a much higher walk rate, and that improved approach helped him get more pitches to drive. Defensively, he probably is a first baseman only, but it's the bat that gives him a chance to hit in the big leagues.  It's hard to evaluate what kind of pitcher Walsh is. Without any real instruction or program, he was touching 93 mph with his fastball and could spin an occasional plus breaking ball. After Walsh's offseason with a dedicated throwing program, the Angels are anxious to see if he can be a two-way player at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"AAA\"","36","\"2015 Draft Rnd 39 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","20","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"46.8\"","\"48.6\"","\"42.5\"","\"46.0\"","\"49.0\"","","\"|\"","0.0000","","","1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","40","45","55","45","55","60","40","50","55","45","60","60","\"|\"","","","","45","45","","50","","","","50","45","","50","","","","\"|\"","40","50","35","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["831","828","1009","996","1156","\"42.8\"","\"41.0\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.1\"","\"37.8\"","\"44.6\"","\"|\"","\"Leonardo\"","\"Rivas\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"2B\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"150\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","1932","660844","","","\"sa872542\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","1","","\"Med\"","2020","40","\"Tbf-2kCq_yI\"","","\"It's very possible that Rivas's elite feel for the strike zone won't translate to upper-level play. He owns a 16% career walk rate, but Rivas and his childlike, Lilliputian frame lack even a modicum of over-the-fence power, and advanced pitching may choose to attack him rather than nibble and let the speedy Rivas reach without putting the ball in play. Even if his walk rate comes down, Rivas does enough other stuff to contribute to a big league roster. He won't hit homers, but he stings high-quality line drive contact to all-fields and can slash doubles down the third base line. He has sufficient speed and range for the middle infield, and has experience at every position but first base and catcher, though he hasn't played the outfield since 2015. Rivas' most realistic path to everyday production involves him retaining something close to his current walk rate, but he's more likely to become a valuable utility man who can play all over the field, and is a fairly high-probability prospect in that regard.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","","\"July 11, 2014 - LAA\"","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 30 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40    Rivas signed with the Angels out of Venezuela for a modest $40,000 back in July 2014 and while he's moved slowly, he immediately stood out because of his advanced approach at the plate and unusual plate discipline. A very solid 2017 season that saw him reach full-season ball for the first time as a teenager had the organization excited for what might come next, but the middle infielder struggled to find his footing in a full Midwest League season in 2018.    One thing Rivas did not lose was his ability to see pitches and draw walks. In fact, he finished second in the Midwest League with 84 free passes, but with that came a huge strikeout spike. Given his lack of power, a 25 percent K rate isn't going to fly, with the switch-hitter perhaps being too selective at the plate at times and not choosing good pitches to hit. While he doesn't lack strength, he didn't impact the ball as successfully as he had previously. He does have the speed to steal some bases, but wasn't particularly efficient on the basepaths in 2018.    Rivas has split time between shortstop and second thus far in his career, though he saw more much more time on the left side of the infield in Burlington.

Oakland took Martin in the first round when he was a plus runner with average raw power, had a good chance to stick at shortstop, and demonstrated surging contact skills. The more pessimistic projections about Martin's bat ended up being more accurate -- the speed, defense, and raw tools have held steady while he has struggled against pro pitching. In 2018, he repeated Double-A at age 23 and finally hit well, but now will jump two levels to the big leagues as the top pick in the Rule 5 Draft. Offensive expectations are low, in part because Martin has never been able to tap into his raw power in games, but also because he has needed to repeat levels to find success.

At age 17, Jimenez was nearly three years younger than the circuit's average player. He held his own, though, hitting .250 with a near equal number of strikeouts (17) and walks (16) over 37 games.   Jimenez is a sum-of-all-parts player who stands out more for his all-around game than any specific tools. He makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, showing feel for hitting the ball back up the middle and the other way with a swing that's compact and direct to the ball. He'll never offer much, if anything, in the way of over-the-fence power, but Jimenez should tally his share of doubles and triples once he gets stronger and finds the gaps more consistently.  Defensively, Jimenez, an average runner, is a solid defender at both middle-infield positions. He is praised for his instincts, is fundamentally sound and can make all the routine plays.

There's still a long way to go, but currently Castillo has rare arm strength, good athleticism, and a good delivery without much else. When projecting someone this young, you can see off-speed pitches that flash average becoming crisper with maturity, and below average command turning into average command, and all of a sudden, you have an average or better MLB starter.

It starts with his plus fastball, which he throws in the 92-95 mph range, though he's been up to 97 mph at times, throwing it with solid life. His slider should be an above-average breaking ball and while his changeup is behind, there is some projection to it and it flashes average.

He can cut it, sink it, use variations in sequence together, and has feel for dumping in first-pitch curveballs for strikes. Gomez is still a lanky teenager who has problems repeating his delivery, so while he has obvious on-mound creativity, he doesn't always execute, and his ability to locate needs to develop. Aside from the fastball, Gomez's stuff is, or projects to be, close to average, and his likely long-term fit is at the back of a rotation. As soon as his command starts to improve, he'll be capable of carving up the lower levels by mixing in all these pitches, and if it happens in 2019, he could end the year with Low-A Charleston.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYY\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - NYY\"","2022","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Though Gomez oozed projection with a skinny 6-foot-3 frame and already ran his fastball into the low 90s as a 16-year-old, New York was able to sign him for just $50,000 out of Venezuela in 2016. He's a long-term project who probably won't be ready for full-season ball until 2020, but he added about 5 mph to his heater in his first two years of pro ball.   Gomez now operates at 91-94 mph and tops out at 96 with his fastball, which plays up because of its high spin rate and the downhill plane he creates with his size and high-three-quarters delivery. He also shows feel for spinning a curveball with some power and depth that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. He has some fade on his changeup and grasps the importance of using it.  While Gomez has a quick arm and a clean delivery, he's still young and figuring out how to keep his mechanics in sync. He has yet to provide consistent strikes but has the ingredients for average control. Given his upside, the Yankees are willing to be patient with his development.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"R\"","34","\"2016 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","27","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"42.1\"","\"50.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2500","2550","35","50","40","50","","50","","45","55","50","55","","55","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","55","","","","","45","","",""],["837","834","784","430","1120","\"42.8\"","\"42.9\"","\"42.9\"","\"44.5\"","\"35.4\"","\"45.3\"","\"|\"","\"Blaze\"","\"Alexander\"","2019","\"20.0\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","248","6","\"|\"","2489","677942","\"alexander_blaze\"","","\"sa3007742\"","\"|\"","","\"IMG Academy HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","42","","","\"Alexander fell out of the top 10 rounds of last year's draft due to questions about his signability, hit tool, and age relative to his peers. He was almost 19 on draft day, which, combined with the strikeout issues, moved him way down the boards of teams who care about those variables, especially together. He ended up signing for a very reasonable $500,000, then hit .362 against AZL pitching and was eventually promoted to the Pioneer League.   He's an advanced defender with an 80 arm (the teams most bearish on his bat in high school wanted to see him on the mound) and above-average raw power, which Alexander's pre-daft proponents insisted he'd get to despite the strikeouts. We don't know much about the plate discipline aspect of the profile yet.

The D-backs saw enough to take him in the 11th round and give him an above-pick-value bonus of $500,000 to sign him away from his South Carolina commitment. The signing is already looking like a steal for Arizona after Alexander slashed .329/.417/.538 across two levels in his pro debut.   There are plenty of tools to be excited about with Alexander. It starts with his near top-of-the-scale arm strength, though he'll need to work on accuracy with his throws across the diamond. He's an athletic shortstop with the hands and feel for the position, and there are mixed opinions as to whether he'll be able to remain there or have to move to second or third base.   Alexander showed enough swing-and-miss as a senior that some scouts worried about how his bat would translate at the next level. He quickly addressed those concerns by hitting to all fields with a clean right-handed swing in his pro debut, and there's reason to believe he'll unlock some more power as he adds strength to his lean, athletic frame.

A contact-oriented speedster in high school, Capel has become a pull-heavy hitter who can lift the ball. Though not aesthically pleasing, Capel's swing is effective. He sees the ball well against righties and connects with pitches all over the strike zone, sending them to the right side of the diamond. Capel projects to have a well-rounded statline -- 50 or 55 hit, 50 power -- against righties, but he's so vulnerable against lefties that he'd likely need a platoon partner in the big leagues.

After ranking among the Midwest League leaders with 22 home runs (third) and pacing all Indians farmhands with 73 runs scored in his first full season, Capel took a step back in 2018 and became Cardinals property in July when they acquired him and Jhon Torres for Oscar Mercado.   With his combination of strength, bat speed and an improved bat path, Capel showed in his first full season that he could hit the ball out to the deepest part of any ballpark, albeit at the cost of more swing-and-miss. In 2018, he made a concerted effort to make more contact and utilized a shorter, less-fluid swing that in turn zapped both his raw and game power, as he followed up his 22-homer campaign by tallying 34 extra-base hits over 118 games in Class A Advanced.   Capel's above-average speed and strong instincts are qualifiers for him on the basepaths and in center field, and he has the arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot.

While some of his 2018 swoon was a result of injury and the offensive environment in the Midwest League, some of his issues are also swing-related. He has to take big, long, full-armed hacks to generate that bat speed, and so he lacks elegant feel for the barrel. He's playing both outfield corners now, not center.

If the early returns are any indication, Diaz, who signed for $100,000 in September 2015 out of Venezuela, will be one of those bargain finds. He flashed big upside in 2017 over a full season in the Pioneer League, hitting .312/.357/.510 with seven homers in 57 games. His full-season debut didn't go as well, though, as Diaz struggled early before a groin injury in June wiped out his remaining season.   Gains in strength led to an uptick in power, and the D-backs think Diaz has a lot more growing to do. With increased power comes increased responsibility to understand the strike zone. Diaz's strikeout and walk rates moved in the wrong direction in each of the past two years -- especially at Class A Kane County before his injury -- because he's developed an overly aggressive, swing-early approach that makes him susceptible to spin and sequence. With better selectivity and a more controllable approach, Diaz quickly could rediscover the hitting ability and power potential he showed in 2017.   Diaz runs very well and can steal a base as well as cover ground in center field, where the D-backs think he could stay for a while.

Cortes has plus raw power and a good lefty swing with some bat control, but not as much as he used to have, and it's further undermined by his power-based approach. He was streaky at South Carolina, getting hot in the second half of his draft year. Scouts who see him when he's running well think he has elite offensive ability.

The Mets took him in the third round two years later as a Draft-eligible sophomore, after Cortes had hit 27 home runs with a .378 OBP in two seasons with the Gamecocks, and signed him for a little more than $1 million.   Few, if any, scouts, question Cortes' ability to hit. He has an innate knack for barreling the ball up from the left side and a long track record of doing it against quality competition. Cortes is listed at 5-foot-7, but he has above-average raw power and gets to it in games because his barrel control is exceptional. His frame is a bit thick, however, and Cortes has below-average speed.   After manning left field in college, Cortes spent his professional debut at second base, showing fringy range but solid hands and instincts, as well as adequate arm strength.

McCann's best tool is his plus raw left-handed power, and he uses the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-2 frame to drive the ball to all fields. There's some swing and miss in his game and he has yet to have much success with wood bats, so he probably won't hit for a high average. But he compensates by working deep counts and drawing plenty of walks to fuel healthy on-base percentages.  There are mixed reviews of McCann's defensive prowess, though a team that believes in his ability to catch and loves his lefty pop could take him as high as the second round.

He's struggled this spring to stay on the ball long enough, perhaps pressing to make up for lost time. A decent athlete who runs well underway, he should be a solid defender at the hot corner with enough arm to stay there in the long-term.

Though he had a low-90s fastball and a hard slider, teams valued his offensive potential even more. His bat might have landed him if the top three rounds if his commitment to Vanderbilt hadn't clouded his signability, and the Red Sox signed him for a well over-slot $565,000 after he slid to the 11th round.  Northcut's bat speed, strength and the loft in his right-handed swing generate impressive raw power. After showing a polished approach as an amateur, he got overly aggressive and struck out in 29 percent of his plate appearances in his pro debut. He's most effective when he uses the whole field and doesn't try to do too much at the plate.  Though he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner, Northcut is a surprisingly effective defender at the hot corner.

He was young for his grade, so he re-classified and repeated 11th grade upon reaching the military school. The move seems to have paid off in terms of his baseball tools, as he's moved firmly into Day 2 conversations.  Baylor shows flashes of all five tools, though he doesn't always consistently show them all at the same time. He didn't impact the ball that much on the summer showcase circuit, but scouts think his right-handed swing works and there should be average future power. It's a loose athletic swing with some bat speed, giving him the chance to hit, but there's some swing and miss and some work to be done on his approach. An excellent athlete, Baylor runs well and is aggressive on the basepaths. He's raw at shortstop, and he'll need to work on his angles and footwork, but might have the chance to stick there, thanks to decent hands, his athleticism and a strong arm that has been up to 92 mph on the mound.   Teams feel that Baylor, committed to Louisburg Junior College, is signable. He had some helium as the Draft approached, with teams pouring in to see him and considering taking him in the top five rounds.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","","16","\"2019 Draft Rnd 3 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","74","91","\"PHI\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","\"32.3\"","\"50.5\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","50","55","40","50","50","45","55","55","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","60","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["846","843","733","538","624","\"42.8\"","\"43.1\"","\"42.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"32.7\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Liover\"","\"Peguero\"","2019","\"18.4\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","168","4","\"|\"","3189","","","","\"sa3005582\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","42","\"kBYfk4hzOdY\"","","\"Teams with Extended Spring coverage in Arizona were split as to which of the two Dbacks shortstop prospects they preferred until Geraldo Perdomo separated himself with his summer performance. Some teams were early Peguero advocates, citing his age, superior athleticism, and a build comparable to a young Jean Segura's.   Like most of Arizona's teenage shortstop prospects, Peguero earned a late-summer promotion with early-season performance, slashing .309/.356/.457 in the DSL. His swing is shorter than a mid-inning station identification and Peguero takes good at-bats for someone his age, so there's big ceiling on the hit tool if his timing at the plate improves. He's also a rangy defender with a plus arm and at least average hands. He can go into the hole, backhand a ball, plant, and hose runners. The frame isn't favorable for power projection, but Peguero's hands are so quick that he might be able to pull and lift enough balls to actually produce some homers. His swing is not currently geared for that type of contact, though. Regardless, the bat and defensive ability is promising, as is the frame and athletic ability. He has everyday shortstop upside.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"R\"","12","\"2017 J2 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"32.7\"","\"50.0\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","45","60","45","55","50","40","50","60","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["847","844","711","1001","132","\"42.8\"","\"43.2\"","\"40.0\"","\"52.6\"","\"45.0\"","\"53.3\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Mercado\"","2019","\"20.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","2107","675650","\"mercado_michael\"","","\"sa3005024\"","\"|\"","","\"Westview HS (CA)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","","","\"As the 2017 draft approached, it seemed like there was a strong possibility that Mercado would matriculate to Stanford.

It turned out the Rays were that team, and Mercado signed for $2.1 million, about $400,000 over slot, as a second rounder. After a year and a half of pro ball, Mercado's stuff is basically the same.

Cut to 2018 and Grisham is a career .238 hitter. The low batting averages he has posted have been due less to his inability to put the bat on the ball and more to an approach that is passive in excess. Grisham watches a lot of driveable pitches go by. That approach is also part of why he's never run a season walk rate beneath 14%, and Grisham's ability to reach base is part of why he's still such an interesting prospect. There has also been an approach change here, one that may have impacted his plate coverage. In two years, he has transitioned from an all-fields doubles doubles approach to a pull-oriented hitter. In the 2018 Fall League he was fouling off pitches that he used to slice for doubles the opposite way. Still only 22, Grisham has physical talent (he once projected, for us, as an average regular) that may resurface with some approach changes, but this current iteration probably isn't a big leaguer.\"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2015, 1st (15) - MIL\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  One of the better prep hitters in the 2015 Draft class, Grisham, who went by Trent Clark at that time, signed for $2.7 million as the No. 15 overall pick. While he hit well that summer in his pro debut, finishing with a .309 average, Grisham has struggled at the plate during his three full-season campaigns, showing little in the way of average or power, albeit as a younger player at each level.   Grisham is still in search of his comfort zone as a hitter. He looked particularly lost at the plate in 2018, setting up so far off the plate with an open stance that his front foot was borderline out of the batter's box. Grisham's stance along with his naturally passive approach opened the door for pitchers to attack him, and he struggled to drive the baseball even when he got a hittable pitch. He still walks a lot and has reached base at a .358 clip for his career, so there still is some hope that Grisham will figure things out.  An average runner who earns high praise for his ability to read pitchers and steal bases, Grisham swiped a career-best 38 bases in 2017 but just 11 last year in Double-A. Defensively, Grisham primarily plays left field but has seen time at all three outfield positions throughout his career. After bottoming out at the plate, Grisham has plenty to prove in what could be a make-or-break 2019 campaign.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"AA\"","14","\"2015 Draft Rnd 1 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.2\"","\"44.5\"","\"41.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","1.0","\"|\"","30","30","50","50","45","45","40","40","50","50","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","40","50","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"SF\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["851","848","960","581","1117","\"42.7\"","\"41.8\"","\"41.4\"","\"44.6\"","\"33.9\"","\"45.6\"","\"|\"","\"Carlos\"","\"Rodriguez\"","2019","\"18.5\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"70\"","\"150\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","1965","677578","","","\"sa3005478\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","\"vcM5bfuL3e4\"","","\"Rodriguez is a plus-plus-running center field prospect with a slash-and-dash approach at the plate.

The Brewers agreed with that assessment, as they gave the 16-year-old outfielder $1.355 million at the outset of the July 2 signing period.   Rodriguez stands out for his plus speed and plus defense in center field, but he also shows the makings of becoming a good hitter. At the plate, Rodriguez has a short, compact stroke that he uses to slash line drives to all fields, albeit with well-below-average power. Rodriguez's wheels allow him to cover large swaths of grass in center field, where scouts believe he'll be a plus defender.   Rodriguez offered a glimpse of his potential last summer during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, where he hit .323 over 56 games before moving stateside for a five-game stint in the Arizona League.

He then went to Florida State, where he put up monstrous, well-rounded numbers, but had questionable speed and defensive ability, a squatty frame, and a squatter batting stance. Baltimore took him late in the first round in 2015 and he didn't perform as expected until a 2017 breakout and a successful big league cup of coffee late in 2018. Stewart has slowly come out of his signature crouch more and more, as nearly every scout projected he would need to as he faced better pitching. His arm strength has improved to be about average so he can play both corner outfield spots now, though he's a 40 runner with a 45 glove at each, so first base and DH -- or a platoon role -- aren't out of the question as he ages. The power and patience are still the calling cards here, with some question on the contact upside that makes him similar to Cumberland, ranked one spot higher on this list. The likely outcome for Stewart is a good multi-positional corner platoon bat, and he may get pushed to that role as soon as late 2019, with Yusniel Diaz, Ryan Mountcasle, and Austin Hays all lurking near the big leagues as better corner outfield fits with more offensive potential.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2015, 1st (25) - BAL\"","","2019","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 45 | Arm: 40 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  Stewart took home Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year honors as a Florida State sophomore in 2014 after he led the conference in all three triple-slash categories. He followed it up with a strong junior campaign, and the Orioles nabbed him with the first of their two first-round picks in June. After a sluggish start to his pro career, Stewart revamped his swing and began to put it all together in 2017, totaling 21 homers and 20 steals in Double-A. His production was less consistent last season in Triple-A, and he also missed some time with a hamstring injury, but the Orioles still gave him a look as a September callup, a challenge to which Stewart responded by hitting .250 with three homers in 17 games.   The open, over-exaggerated crouch that Stewart employed at FSU has evolved into a more upright and closed-off stance as a pro. It's enabled him to make better use of his hands and wrists, helping him catch up to velocity and tap into some power, though, overall, his swing lacks versatility. Stewart's patient approach and strong on-base skills have long been strengths, and he offers value on the basepaths with his average speed. A good athlete despite his stocky build, he's a fringy defender at both outfielder corners, but profiles better in left field due to his below-average arm strength.   After his first taste of the Majors last season, Stewart is positioned to see even more playing time in 2019 as the Orioles continue their rebuild.

While there aren't any high-profile first-rounders on the roster, there is plenty of talent teams are contemplating over the top five or six rounds. Kreidler, who has shown tremendous defense chops at shortstop and third base, is firmly in those conversations thanks to a more consistent bat.  A three-year starter for the Bruins, Kreidler hadn't swung the bat well over his first two seasons, but has taken a solid step forward in impacting the baseball as a junior. There's some power in his right-handed swing and he's starting to show he can get to it in games. Even with those improvements, it's his glovework that stands out. While he's big and strong at 6-foot-4, scouts think he can stick at shortstop with a Troy Tulowitzki-like defensive profile. He moves very well for his size with a cannon for an arm. Even if he had to move, he has the skills to be a Gold Glove-caliber third baseman.  Known for his natural leadership skills, Kreidler has a tendency to be on winning teams, including his Cape Cod League squad last summer. A team that thinks he'll hit enough to be a big league regular on the left side of the infield will be the one to take him on Day 2 of the Draft.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","","23","\"2019 Draft Rnd 4 (DET)\"","\"|\"","115","112","\"DET\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","\"39.1\"","\"46.8\"","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","55","50","45","55","40","50","55","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","50","65","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["857","854","777","995","623","\"42.7\"","\"42.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"48.6\"","\"46.8\"","\"48.8\"","\"|\"","\"Matt\"","\"Beaty\"","2019","\"26.1\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2031","607461","","17710","\"sa602895\"","\"|\"","","\"Belmont\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2019","40","\"IVWKrSI56Qo\"","\" \"","\"Coming off a strong 2017 during which he was named Texas League Player of the Year, Beaty only played 34 games in 2018 due to a torn thumb ligament that required surgery.

He broke out in 2017, winning the Texas League MVP award and leading the Double-A circuit in batting (.326) and OPS (.883). An intercostal strain and a torn thumb ligament ruined his encore, limiting him to just 34 games last year.  With a disciplined approach and quality hand-eye coordination, Beaty makes repeated line-drive contact to all fields. He made some adjustments to his left-handed swing in mid-2017 that allowed him to drive the ball more often for some pull power, but he still stands out more for his hitting and on-base ability than as a home run threat. He has struggled against left-handers in the upper Minors, so he'll have to adapt or risk being tagged as a platoon player.  A fringy runner with an average arm, Beaty has split most of his career between first base and third base. He's a decent defender at either corner and also has made brief appearances at second base, left field and right field as a pro.

Marte flashes plus speed, range, hands, and arm strength and while he needs to tighten up his strike zone, he has contact skills even though the strength deficit means pitchers can throw strikes without fear of an extra base hit.

Though both of Moss' swings are fairly inconsistent (which should be expected for a switch-hitter this age), he'll show you feel for both lift and contact at times, and he gets the most out of his little body without losing control of it. While there's a large developmental gap between where Moss is as a defender right now and where he'll need to be in order to stay on the infield, he's a very athletic, very young player with tons of time to improve those things, and his physical gifts are so prominent that we anticipate he will. Up the middle switch-hitters with some pop, even if it's just doubles power, are very valuable big leaguers, and not many prospects have a chance to become that kind of player.

But Olivares entered 2018 with a more open, upright stance that seemed to benefit his timing and enabled him to pull the ball more, so perhaps last year's power output isn't a complete mirage and there are some right-tail paths to everyday production.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A+\"","31","\"2014 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.2\"","\"49.1\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","20","40","60","50","55","50","40","45","60","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["866","863","950","983","517","\"42.6\"","\"41.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.2\"","\"35.5\"","\"50.5\"","\"|\"","\"Danny\"","\"Lantigua\"","2019","\"20.2\"","\"RF\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","3215","","","","\"sa3005239\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","","\"There are ways to nitpick Lantigua -- he's very likely to move out of center field entirely and he also strikes out a lot-- but, ultimately, he's a switch-hitter with plus power whose two swings are further along than is typical for most 19-year-old switch hitters.

Tinoco made a very strong first impression the rest of that season, struggled in 2016, then bounced back in 2017 to earn a spot on the 40-man roster. His move to Double-A in 2018 was up-and-down, though he did participate in the Futures Game.  The Rockies are still very much bullish on Tinoco's stuff and upside. He'll throw his plus fastball up to 97 mph, sitting in the 93-95 mph range and he backs it up with a pair of breaking balls. It's actually at its best when it's between a curve and slider, as he can cast the true curve at times and the slurvy version is a swing-and-miss pitch. He flashes a changeup that's average and his command could be Major League average as well.  Tinoco has improved his delivery, staying much more in control and in line with his follow through, with more leverage over the rubber. It's still unclear what his long-term role is, especially after he looked very comfortable pitching in relief in the Arizona Fall League in 2018.

The six-foot right-hander spent two summers in the Dominican Summer League before making his United States debut in '15 and it took until '18 for him to get to the Class A Advanced Carolina League. He made the most of it, earning the league's ERA title, though he was left unprotected for the second straight year in the Rule 5 Draft and wasn't selected.  Garabito's stuff is largely average across the board and when he's on, he mixes all three of his pitches well to keep hitters off balance. His fastball is a tick above average, especially when he's commanding it well, thrown with good movement and his upper 70s curveball has good depth to it. His changeup gives him a third average pitch he uses effectively.   The key for Garabito to make it as a back-end starter in the big leagues will be to continue improving his fastball command. He was particularly effective in the second half of the 2018 season and the Royals hope that carries over as he attacks the upper levels of the system, with an Arnaldo Hernandez-type breakout the best-case scenario.

Taking over at first base for consensus 2017 college player of the year Brendan McKay, the No. 4 overall pick in that year's Draft, Wyatt ranked in the top 20 in NCAA Division I in walks (69, third), on-base percentage (.490, 15th), RBIs (69, 17th) and doubles (22, 18th). He encored with a solid summer in the Cape Cod League, which he led with 29 walks in 40 games, and has matched his sophomore numbers this spring.  Wyatt is reminiscent of McKay as an offensive player. He's a left-handed hitter with plus raw power but focuses more on making consistent contact and getting on base. He has tremendous feel for hitting, manages the strike zone very well and could develop at least 20-homer power on an annual basis if he gets more aggressive and drives more balls in the air.

A switch-hitter with a simple swing and conservative approach to contact, Haggarty's best offensive skill is his eye for the strike zone, which has enabled him to walk at a 13% career clip. He is limited from both a power and bat-to-ball standpoint, so it's possible his patience will be irrelevant if big league pitching decides he's not a threat to do damage on his own and make it a point to let him put the ball in play. Through Double-A, though, this hasn't happened. The oft-injured Haggerty fell all the way to the 25th round of the 2015 draft because he dealt with an oblique injury during his draft year and underperformed.

He went straight to the GCL at age 17, then to a Penn League packed with 21-year-olds at age 18. Pineda works hard enough that scouts from opposing clubs have taken notice; his leadership qualities have been evident during two postseason runs (circumstances that are helping to drive the 'winning player' narrative here) in two pro seasons. He's a bat-first catcher with some pull power and an above-average arm. He's raw on defense and is already a sturdily built young man who may overthicken and become immobile, but based on the makeup reports it sounds like Pineda will do what is necessary to stay back there.

Among that group was Pineda, a Venezuelan catcher whom Washington signed for $450,000 on July 2. He was advanced enough to make the jump stateside to the Gulf Coast League for his pro debut the next year and garnered mid-season New York-Penn League All-Star honors in 2018 before undergoing season-ending surgery for a broken left hamate bone in late August.  Pineda controls the barrel well and keeps it in the zone for a long time, using his strong hands and wrists to generate hard contact and drive the ball across the whole field. His advanced feel for hitting at a young age leads scouts to believe that the right-handed hitter will eventually hit for some power to go along with a solid batting average.  Pineda has a strong arm behind the plate, and club officials have been pleased with his continued development as a receiver.

He's been playing above his tools and exceeding expectations since and while he struggled in his first taste of Triple-A in 2018, he was added to the 40-man roster this past offseason.  Wade's best skill is his approach at the plate, with a very strong walk rate and plate discipline that he's carried with him all the way up the ladder. Even after the bump he hit in Rochester in 2018, he has walked more than he has struck out heading into the 2019 season. While he did hit a career high 11 home runs last year, Wade has not learned to leverage his left-handed swing to generate more power. An average runner, Wade plays solid defense in the corners, but while he can fill in as a center fielder, he's below average defensively there.  For Wade to profile as anything more than a backup outfielder at the big league level, he's going to have to find a way to tap into his power more.

He dominated the Bulldogs in his first start in two years, striking out seven in 5 2/3 no-hit innings, prompting a Max Scherzer comparison from one scout, but pitched his way into the bullpen by late April.  Ashcraft has legitimate power stuff, beginning with a four-seam fastball that sits at 94-96 mph and reaches 98 when he's dialed in. His four-seamer is fairly straight, so he'll also mix in some two-seamers in the low 90s. When he can land them for strikes, his mid-80s slider is at least a plus pitch and his hard curveball is a solid offering.  Though Ashcraft also shows some feel for a changeup with some fade and sink, giving him four usable pitches, he's almost certainly a reliever. Though there are no glaring flaws with his delivery, he has no track record of throwing strikes, let alone commanding his arsenal.

He paced the Rookie-level Arizona League with eight homers in 2016 and encored by hitting a combined .366/.394/.556 at three levels (including the Class A Advanced California League playoffs). He returned to the Cal League in 2018 and slumped during the first half before finishing on a .356/.382/.624 tear with 10 homers in the final six weeks to top the circuit in homers (24) and RBIs (109), then won playoff MVP honors after leading Rancho Cucamonga to the championship.  Santana's electric bat speed and strength give him power to all fields, though there's some concern as to how it will translate at higher levels. He has settled his right-handed stroke down somewhat since turning pro, but he still has a hyper-aggressive approach and struggles against breaking pitches. He still overswings and chases balls out of the strike zone too often instead of just letting his natural pop take over.

Hernandez is a premium athlete with a strong frame who has a high-energy style on the field. An aggressive hitter, he has terrific bat speed and outstanding raw power from the right side of the plate. That pop shows up more on the pull side, but he can drive the ball to all fields and should tap into it more consistently as he refines his approach at the plate. Hernandez's plus speed should continue to help him on both sides of the ball.  Hernandez is a center fielder for the time being, but there's the chance he could grow and develop more into the prototypical athletic right-fielder mold down the road.

He uses his slider off of his cutting fastball well and it looks like his fastball but then keeps going and back-foots hitters, especially effective against left-handed hitters. He misses bats and gets ground-ball outs, with hitters having a hard time seeing the ball.  In addition to continuing to develop his changeup, Tillo's biggest issue is his control.

His power has yet to translate to pro ball, as he hit 10 homers and slugged .404 in his first two seasons.  When Sheets was an amateur, there were some questions about whether he had enough bat speed to punish quality fastballs. The White Sox believe the home runs will come if he starts incorporating his legs more in his left-handed swing and makes an adjustment to stop hooking balls foul down the right-field line. He has a smooth stroke and controls the strike zone well for a big man, so he should hit for average and draw a healthy amount of walks.  Sheets moves well for a 6-foot-4, 230-pounder, though his speed is still well below average. He has worked diligently to make himself into an average defender at first base.

The Rockies took note and took him in the 12th round of the 2015 Draft. He shook off a slow start to his career and an injury in 2017 to pitch well enough in the California League and the Arizona Fall League in 2018 to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.    Lawrence continues to throw harder as he progresses through the Rockies system, thanks to his throwing program and tweaks he's made to his delivery. He's now 97-100 mph with his fastball, routinely hitting triple digits during his AFL stint, coming from a very low three-quarters to sidearm slot. At times, there's some serious sink that elicits a ton of groundball outs. He's already a very uncomfortable at-bat for any right-handed hitter and he's working on tightening up his slider to be a better all-around reliever.     With his delivery and arm slot, it's tough for Lawrence to remain consistent in his mechanics, leading to some issues with command.

One of the things that attracted the Indians to Fermin in the first place was his mature approach, as he uses a simple right-handed swing and mastery of the strike zone to lace line drives to all fields. He won't ever be a huge power threat, but he'll need to continue to get stronger so he can hit the ball with authority against more advanced pitching. He has average speed with keen instincts as a runner and basestealer.  Fermin's smarts also help his tools play up on defense.

Like Vargas, he went from the Dominican Summer League to the Arizona League in his first summer of pro ball in 2017, then took a nice step forward in his return to the AZL the following summer.  The key to Diaz's progress offensively was an increased understanding of his approach, and the right-handed hitter stayed with it all summer.

Still more of a thrower than pitcher, Riley has two plus power pitches at his disposal. He'll touch 97 mph with his fastball, which has cutting action to it, and his mid-80s slider is a wipeout pitch that misses bats when he's at his best.

That distinction currently belongs to Kurt Hall, a Tigers eighth-rounder in 1977.    Fletcher offers a tantalizing combination of plus raw power, speed and arm strength. He also has run his fastball up to 93 mph and flashed a hard slider on the mound. He's a potential 20-20 center fielder if everything comes together, but he's also going to require a lot of time and patience with his development.    Though Fletcher makes loud contact when he connects at the plate, there are questions about his hitting ability and how well his raw power will translate into production. He has a big leg kick that he'll need to tone down and he may have to rework his right-handed swing.

Things didn't go quite as well in his draft spring, as those three tools continued to stand out, but Banfield's swing mechanics, feel to hit, and overall hitting projection tailed off a bit. The Marlins like the upside here, with a chance to have an above average defensive catcher who may just need consistent coaching to tease out average offensive upside.

Miami grabbed him with a supplemental second-round choice and paid him a $1.8 million bonus (nearly twice his slot value at No. 69) to sway him away from Vanderbilt.  Banfield's signature tool is his well-above-average arm strength, which he enhances with a quick release and accuracy on his throws. His receiving skills are advanced and smooth. A natural leader, he impressed teammates in his pro debut and has taken to learning Spanish so he can better communicate with all of his teammates, especially the pitchers.   Though he's considered a defense-first catcher and struck out in 29 percent of his plate appearances during his first taste of pro ball, Banfield offers some upside at the plate. He has good bat speed and impacts the baseball, but he tends to get overly aggressive and his right-handed swing gets long.

He probably needs to be a 60 bat or better to play every day, which is feasible considering that his attributes, dating back to high school, are lead by a short swing and barrel control.

They went in the same area of the Draft, with Phillips an Expos second-rounder in 1999 and Miller signing for an over-slot $1.1 million as a Giants third-rounder in 2015. While Phillips immediately produced at the plate in pro ball, Miller struggled offensively until he repeated high Class A in 2018.  Miller always had an efficient right-handed swing but didn't start making hard contact until he gained more muscle and experience. He has strong wrists and finished fifth in the California League with 51 extra-base hits last year after he started to turn on more pitches. His aggressive approach results in few walks, however, and may require an adjustment against more advanced pitchers.  A solid runner, Miller can steal an occasional base. Like Phillips, he was drafted as a shortstop but wound up at second base.

He's now an 80 runner but still doesn't quite have the hands or actions for the infield; he could work his way into being a passable second baseman, but we would guess center field is where he lands. His approach is solid but not great, in part because he has above average bat control and, obviously, the speed to outrun softly-hit balls. There's enough power to hit homers to the pull side when he gets ahold of a fastball in, but not much in way of home run potential. He's gotten a little too pull-heavy in pro ball and should use more of an all-fields approach to have a shot to develop the contact skills he needs to turn into a low-end regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"OAK\"","\"2017, CBA (33) - OAK\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 70 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Speed is a commodity that's hard to come by in prospects. When one combines it with an outstanding college season swinging the bat, he's likely to rise up Draft boards. That's what happened with Merrell, who hit .384 as a South Florida junior to land him at pick No. 33 in 2017. Though he was banged up, he had a strong pro debut in the New York-Penn League and was holding his own during his full-season debut in the California League until a sprained elbow shelved him in June.  Merrell should be able to use his legs to wreak havoc on the basepaths. He's still learning his left-handed swing and he had a tendency to hook balls on the ground early on. He's now working on getting some separation so he can impact the ball, and he's learning to slash the ball to the left side so he can use his legs to help him more. The combination of approach and speed could make him an above-average hitter, albeit one with little power, in time. It's unclear what Merrell's long-term defensive home will be. He's unorthodox defensively at short, with a fringy arm, but he does have impressive range. He impressed in big league camp during 2018 Spring Training, playing on both sides of second base. He also played some outfield in college.  It could be that Merrell ends up fitting a super-utility role at the big league level, with his speed playing at a number of positions, though it's too early to rule out an every day gig at second base.

His complete inability to hit could be fixable, as it may be largely swing-related. Currently, Ynfante bars his lead arm and loads his hands late, often making his barrel late into the zone. He also strides open, making him vulnerable to breaking stuff tiliting away from him. These issues are not immutable, and Ynfante's physical abilities -- his bat speed and ability to move the bat around the zone a bit -- are very promising. There's much work to be done here.

His development has been slower than expected so far in the pro ranks, as he spent three summers in the Dominican Summer League before heading stateside for a brief United States debut in 2016. Ynfante offered a glimpse of his potential by slashing .299/.374/.491 with seven homers in 43 games in the Rookie-level Appalachian League, only to regress across the board last season with an assignment to the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League.  When he first arrived in the States, Ynfante did show off some considerable tools, finishing in the top 10 in the Appy League in slugging percentage and OPS while also swiping 11 bases. Still maturing physically, Ynfante has shown that he is already capable of impacting the baseball, with most of his power coming to his pull side thus far. There is concern that Ynfante will not hit enough to tap into that power as he moves up, and his .213 average and 35 percent strikeout rate in 2018 won't inspire much confidence. However, the Cardinals feel he'll make the adjustments with his setup at the plate to improve his hit tool.  Ynfante's plus speed will continue to make him a basestealing threat and give him enough range to play center field.

Rosario is kind of like Lugo's mirror image, with outstanding glove work his carrying tool and some concerns about how much he'll hit.  Rosario is considered to be the top defensive shortstop on the island this spring. He has excellent hands and an above-average arm, not to mention solid range, footwork and instincts to stay at the position long-term. The biggest thing holding Rosario back offensively is his current lack of strength. He has good hand-eye coordination and makes a lot of contact, but isn't strong enough to impact the ball consistently. His right-handed swing gets long at times when he tries to muscle up and he definitely lengthens his swing to get leverage to show power in batting practice.  The Southern California commit should be able to shorten his swing when he adds some strength, with future gap power likely his ceiling in that category. The team that believes he will be able to do that and become an average hitter will be the one to take him early enough, seeing him as a glove-first every day player at a premium position.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SFG\"","","25","\"2019 Draft Rnd 6 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","95","176","\"SFG\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","\"32.7\"","\"48.6\"","\"45.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","50","60","40","55","45","45","55","55","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["908","905","837","535","976","\"42.4\"","\"42.6\"","\"42.0\"","\"46.2\"","\"34.5\"","\"47.3\"","\"|\"","\"Patrick\"","\"Hilson\"","2019","\"18.8\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","168","4","\"|\"","3188","","","","\"sa3007048\"","\"|\"","","\"Nettleton HS (AR)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","42","","","\"Of all the players we've written up on the team reports (there are about 1,000 on The Board and well over that if you count the Others of Note section of the lists) the gap between what Hilson is now and what he might be is perhaps the biggest.

He topped out at 92. In high school, Gowdy had No. 4 starter stuff. At his best, he'd sit 90-94 with pinpoint glove-side command of an above-average slider. He was in the 2016 draft's crowded late-first and early-second round prep pitching picture, a group that hasn't yet seen anyone emerge as several have required UCL reconstruction.

They've barely been able to get any return on the investment as he made four brief Gulf Coast League outings after being drafted, then needed Tommy John surgery in the summer of '17, knocking him out for all of the '18 season.  The good news is Gowdy did get on the mound and threw in the very last instructional league game last fall, heading into the offseason healthy and in good spirits. The Phillies are optimistic they can get the Gowdy they drafted back, or perhaps an even better version as he has added strength during the rehab process. Before the injury, the right-hander stood out for his advanced feel for pitching, especially given his age, showing the ability to throw three pitches for strikes consistently. His fastball was in the low 90s, with the chance to add velocity as he filled out his 6-foot-4 frame. His breaking ball was a bit of a hybrid slider that flashed above-average, and he showed good feel for a changeup.  The most important thing now is for Gowdy to get a full, healthy year of innings in so he can put his surgery firmly in the rear view mirror.

He struggled to throw strikes for two months leading up to the draft and fell to the fourth round. Hill does have good stuff. He'll sit 90-94 and his big, 6-foot-6 frame and lower arm slot combine to create a unique look for hitters. His slider breaks late and has good length when located to Hill's arm side, and Hill's changeup has good action because of his lower arm slot. His limited command probably relegates Hill to the bullpen eventually, but he has #4/5 starter stuff if he can develop better control in his mid-20s, which sometimes happens to pitchers this size. \"","\"|\"","","\"MIL\"","\"2018, 4th (110) - NYM\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  As a South Carolina junior in 2018, Hill flirted with no-hitters in back-to-back early-season starts against Charleston Southern and Clemson, striking out 14 in each outing. The performances sent his Draft stock soaring, though he wasn't nearly as dominant the rest of the way and missed time in March with shoulder tendinitis. After the Mets made him their fourth-round pick in June, Hill averaged 15.3 strikeouts-per-nine during his pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. Hill was dealt to the Brewers in the Keon Broxton trade in January 2019.  Hill's best pitch is his fastball, which sits around 91-93 mph and peaks at 95. He uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create good plane and extension, and has some crossfire in his delivery that imparts running life on his heater. His changeup has been more reliable than his slider this spring, with each showing signs of becoming a solid offering when at their best.  Hill is more physical than athletic, and he sometimes struggles to keep his delivery together and locate his pitches where he wants. If he can do a better job of maintaining his velocity into the later innings, improving the consistency of his secondary offerings and commanding his stuff, he could be a No. 3 starter. If not, he might be more of a sixth- or seventh-inning reliever because he lacks an overpowering fastball or a dynamic second pitch.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"A\"","22","\"2018 Draft Rnd 4 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","27","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.2\"","\"49.2\"","\"42.1\"","\"|\"","0.2500","0.0000","0.0000","-1.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2250","2250","40","45","50","","50","","","45","50","55","","55","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","55","55","","","","40","","",""],["912","909","888","959","484","\"42.3\"","\"42.3\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.4\"","\"42.5\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Cole\"","\"Sands\"","2019","\"21.9\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1284","","\"sands_cole\"","","\"sa3008611\"","\"|\"","","\"Florida State\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","\" \"","\"Sands' older brother Carson was a high pick by the Cubs, and prep teammate Cole Ragans was a high pick by Texas from a historically-strong prep pitching staff.

Hill remains fleet of foot and is a reputable defensive center fielder.

That's even true for someone like Hill, who grew up around the game with a father, Orsino, who played and is now a scout. But the Tigers' 2014 first-rounder has had trouble gaining any traction after injuries -- a quad injury in 2015 and Tommy John surgery in late 2016 -- kept him off the field early in his career. He finally had his first fully healthy pro campaign in 2018, spending the entire season at Class A Advanced Lakeland, and progressed to Double-A for the first time in '19.    Defensively, Hill could play in the big leagues right now. He's as good a center fielder as anyone in the organization and can flat-out get the ball wherever it's hit using his outstanding closing speed. What once was a plus arm now plays more toward average, but there is room for improvement as Hill distances himself from surgery. Hill's speed is a game-changer on the bases as well, and he's proved to be a prolific basestealer - he has two 35-steal campaigns in the last three years - when healthy.   With Hill, the question continues to be if he'll hit and get on base enough to truly utilize that speed. He became more fluid with his swing and began to make some progress late in the 2018 season that carried over into his Double-A campaign. Hill's ability to impact games in the outfield and on the basepaths gives him a solid floor, and he could still become a dynamic everyday up-the-middle player if his bat continues to develop.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"AA\"","24","\"2014 Draft Rnd 1 (DET)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"40.9\"","\"50.0\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","20","50","70","50","50","45","45","50","70","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","70","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"NYM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["915","912","855","562","1065","\"42.3\"","\"42.5\"","\"41.4\"","\"45.2\"","\"40.8\"","\"45.6\"","\"|\"","\"Reese\"","\"McGuire\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","240","6","\"|\"","118","624512","\"mcguire_reese\"","15674","\"sa737505\"","\"|\"","","\"Kentwood HS (WA)\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2019","40","\"R-7ft9EA2ac\"","","\"The Blue Jays have a terrific young catching tandem in Danny Jansen and McGuire, who we project to play a glove-centric second fiddle to Jansen's bat for the next half decade.

Three years later, he was in his first season at the Double-A level when the Pirates packaged him with Harold Ramirez and Francisco Liriano to the Blue Jays in a Trade Deadline deal. A left oblique injury sidelined McGuire during the first half in 2017, but McGuire performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and made up for lost time that offseason playing in the Dominican Winter League. And even though he underwhelmed with his production in 2018 at Triple-A, McGuire still earned his first big league callup in September and made the most of his opportunity, hitting .290 with a pair of homers and three doubles in 14 games.   Defense will always be the driving force behind McGuire's game. He's an excellent blocker and receiver, who's been praised for his game-calling and feel for managing a pitching staff at every stop in his career. His arm strength is above-average but plays up because he's technically sound, he has a quick release and consistently delivers accurate throws. He has some natural hitting ability from the left side of the plate, with a level, line-drive-producing swing and knowledge of the zone. The majority of McGuire's hits are singles, though he can run into one here and there, and occasionally he'll go on an uncharacteristic power-hitting streak.

He slammed 17 homers and broke the school's freshman RBI record held by Frank Thomas with 69 last spring. Though he's just a 20-year-old sophomore, MLB ruled him eligible for the 2019 Draft in March after deciding that his year at a Canadian secondary school was equivalent to a year in college.  Julien is geared to hit for power and offers more than most left-handed college hitters in this year's class. His considerable strength and a stroke that features plenty of bat speed and loft combine to give him the ability to drive the ball out of any part of the ballpark. He draws a lot of walks because opponents are reluctant to challenge him, though there's also a lot of swing and miss in his game because he's so aggressive and will expand his strike zone.

Offensively, there's much less to get excited about; there isn't much raw power, with even less in games (due in part to his contact-oriented mechanics), and his pitch selection comes and goes, as seen especially in a down 2018 season. Due to his glove, he was added to the 40-man roster and now there's less chance his offense will get time to breathe, as he'll be burning options and may be needed for emergency duty in the big leagues.

The Phillies signed him for $900,000 that July and have watched him shine defensively and show glimpses with the bat, though far from consistently. Despite the offensive issues, the Phillies thought enough of his toolset to add him to the 40-man roster following the 2018 season.  Though he has yet to show it for any extended period of time, Gamboa has provided flashes of being able to do everything well while playing a premium position. His defense is definitely still his calling card, and he'll show off his plus arm and above-average range at times, looking smooth and flashy at one moment, then out of sync at other times. He has average raw power from both sides of the plate but hasn't come close to tapping into it with a contact-first approach. He does have the bat speed to eventually develop into an average hitter.  Gamboa is one of the most enigmatic prospects in the system. Based on raw ability, he might be considered a top 10 prospect.

He dealt with a shoulder issue throughout 2017 but arrived to camp in 2018 healthy, stronger, and with much more raw power than he had the year before.   Hunt's swing remains somewhat unbalanced and he often dives in and loses posture that would enable him to pull the ball with power. His top hand doesn't drive contact as much as it probably could.

The Costa Mesa native passed up a Pepperdine commitment and signed with San Diego for $1.6 million -- nearly double the assigned value of his slot. He served as designated hitter in the Arizona Rookie League due to a shoulder injury. But he made the jump to short-season Class A in '18, where he caught more innings than anyone else in the Northwest League, while posting a .271 batting average with a .371 on-base percentage.  A strong 6-foot-4, Hunt's arm strength is his defining trait as a catcher. He's well below two seconds with his pop time -- often below 1.9. Despite his size, the Padres seem confident in his framing abilities, too. Offensively, Hunt's swing can get long, and it's got a few too many moving pieces. But he seems to understand the strike zone well enough, and he should develop a fair amount of power.  Hunt has big strides to make on offense and some tweaks on defense. As prospects go, he's risky, given that he remains so raw.

Since he signed as a 22-year-old and is a corner-based, power-over-hit bat, Deichmann needed to perform quickly but a broken hamate limited his 2018 and may keep him from getting to that power in games until later in 2019.

Deciding to go back to LSU for his junior year was a smart move, as he hit 19 more homers and catapulted into the second round of the 2017 Draft. A solid summer debut did not carry over to his first full season as a wrist injury allowed him to play just 58 games for all of 2018.  Even when Diechmann was on the field in 2018, he wasn't fully healthy as he tried to play through the issue. Initially misdiagnosed as tendinitis, it turned out to be an injury near his hamate and sapped him of his best tool when he was able to play. The A's liked what they saw in terms of his power potential in his first summer and at instructs that fall, and they are hoping to have that player back again in 2019. His approach has helped him get to his power consistently and while he will strike out, he'll also draw walks.  His strong arm and power profile are good fits in right field, his likely long-term home, and he should be an average defender there.

His arm angle and the shape of his fastball create a pitch that looks very similar to Zach Britton's sinker, but with much less zip. Though the Giants, who traded him to Tampa as part of the Evan Longoria deal, tried to develop Krook as a starter early in his career, a combination of injury concern (bad delivery, flunked physical coming out of high school, TJ in college) and lack of control made it likely that he'd eventually move to the bullpen, and that transition -- or at least to a role where Krook throws a number of innings typical of a reliever; he may be a candidate to 'open', but we don't know for sure -- is underway. Krook used to live in the low-to-mid-90s and his drop in velocity is perhaps a red flag, considering his medical history. But it plays even at this velocity, and so do his two breaking balls, which benefit from the deceptive ugliness of his delivery.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TBR\"","\"AA\"","37","\"2016 Draft Rnd 4 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.0\"","\"50.0\"","","\"|\"","0.0000","0.0000","0.0000","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2350","2650","45","50","","","40","","","50","50","","","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["924","921","852","956","367","\"42.2\"","\"42.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"50.1\"","\"42.5\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Roniel\"","\"Raudes\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"160\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1870","659267","","","\"sa872825\"","\"|\"","","\"Nicaragua\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2020","40","","","\"After pushing him very quickly at the onset of his pro career, in 2018 the Red Sox throttled down Raudes' development and had him repeat Hi-A.

His ground ball rate dropped from 46% to 30% and he slugged 53 extra-base hits last year. The increased lift also caused Craig's peripherals to shift slightly (the BB% down, the K% up) and his OBP tanked, but we like Craig's chances of hitting for enough power to profile at first base more now than we did a year ago.

A star at Wake Forest, Craig entered pro ball as a first-round pick who was an advanced college performer at the plate, one who could hit for average and get on-base and he fit that profile during his first full season. When he got to Double-A for year two, however, he tapped into his raw power consistently, but at the expense of his hit tool. He capped off a year that saw him lead the organization in home runs and RBIs with a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League.  Few doubted that the big, strong Craig had power to tap into as a professional, but they also knew that he wasn't focusing on that part of his game, instead relying on his ability to work counts and make contact. His decision to work on driving the ball did lead to run production, but also saw his strikeout rate go up and his walk rate diminish. The Pirates aren't overly upset that he's likely more power over hit now because, as an at least below-average runner, singles and walks aren't quite as effective.  As Craig changed his offensive profile for power, he was also working on his defense at first base, where it now looks like he'll be a solid defender with good hands and a strong arm. There's a chance Craig could find a balance between his old and new selves at the plate, but the Pirates would be happy to see that kind of power production from the infield corner spot moving forward.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PIT\"","\"AAA\"","18","\"2016 Draft Rnd 1 (PIT)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"44.5\"","\"48.2\"","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","-1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","45","55","30","40","60","50","55","55","30","40","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","35","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["927","924","994","1385","112","\"42.1\"","\"41.2\"","\"37.0\"","\"52.8\"","\"46.7\"","\"53.3\"","\"|\"","\"Jhonathan\"","\"Diaz\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","2256","646242","","","\"sa828483\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","1","","\"Med\"","2019","37","","","\"Diaz had a strong 2018 (153 innings, 147 K, 39 BB, 53% GB%) repeating Low-A as a 21-year-old.

He's a switch-hitting middle infielder with above-average bat control, so there are all sorts of exciting hit/power/defensive profile mixes in play, depending on how Arauz develops physically. He has filled out a bit since he first signed (he was acquired from Philly in the Ken Giles deal) but scouts had mixed feelings about his body composition last year, and largely have him projected to second base. If that's the case, ideally there will be more power than there is right now, and it's fair to project some based on Arauz's age.   For now, though, he has very little strength and at times appears to struggle to rip the barrel through the top of the zone and instead is adept at letting the bat do most of the work on pitches near his knees. The lift this creates is intriguing, but there needs to be more raw power if it's going to matter.

He drew a 50-game suspension in 2017 after testing positive for a stimulant, while his 2018 season was a tale of two halves. He posted a career-best .863 OPS in low Class A before slumping to a career-worst .511 OPS in his first taste of high Class A.  Arauz's .240/.316/.353 line in his first four pro seasons is more a reflection of being one of the youngest players in each of his leagues than an indictment of his offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter with a line-drive stroke, a good sense of the strike zone and the bat speed and deceptive strength for double-digit home run potential. His biggest problem is that he doesn't use his legs enough at the plate and makes too much weak contact.  Arauz has average speed but a quicker first step that gives him the range to stay at shortstop. He's an unusually reliable defender for his age, at both shortstop and second base. His solid arm also makes him a viable option at third base, where he has seen brief action, and enhances his value as a potential utilityman.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"A+\"","24","\"2014 J2 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.9\"","\"46.8\"","\"42.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","20","35","45","50","55","55","30","40","45","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","50","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["929","926","901","557","1064","\"42.1\"","\"42.2\"","\"41.4\"","\"45.2\"","\"36.4\"","\"46.0\"","\"|\"","\"Hayden\"","\"Dunhurst\"","2019","\"21.1\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"208\"","\"draft\"","160","4","\"|\"","2918","","\"dunhurst_hayden\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Pearl River Central HS\"","0","0","","","","40","","\"Prep catcher has a wide base of skills and has been steadily rising in class that isn't deep on backstops.\"","","\"|\"","\"Pearl River Central (Miss.)

He should go between the third and fifth round, which will be high enough to divert him from a Mississippi commitment.    Dunhurst has the potential to make an impact both offensively and defensively. He has cleaned up his work behind the plate and could become a solid receiver if he continues to improve. He loves to catch and has a strong arm to combat basestealers.    A left-handed hitter, Dunhurst generates plus raw power with a combination of bat speed and strength.

While Fitzgerald doesn't have loud tools, he's a steady performer in all facets of the game. He has improved offensively throughout his college career, making regular contact to all fields from the right side of the plate. He's not a slugger but he has a strong 6-foot-3 frame and has hit the ball harder this spring, so he could have 12-15 home run power if he continues to develop.

Valdes had stood out previously because of his defensive acumen, but some added strength has made him more of a legitimate prospect as the Draft approached, with his name creeping into Day 1 conversations.  There's no question Valdes' calling card is his defense. He'll be able to play shortstop long-term with good hands, a cannon for an arm and the ability to throw from all angles. Like with many young shortstops, he'll make the flashy plays and then lose focus on others at times, though no one doubts he'll gain consistency as he matures. The big question around Valdes is his bat. He's trying to switch-hit currently, with his left side behind his right, and though he's added good weight, a lack of strength concerns some as his bat tends to trail through the zone leading to an opposite-field based approach.  A lack of true defensive shortstops in this class has no doubt helped Valdes, who has reminded some of a Luis Guillorme type, shine by comparison. A team taking him early, and signing him away from his commitment to Florida State, will be one that sees enough future strength gains to allow his bat to catch enough for him to be a glove-first everyday shortstop at the big league level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CLE\"","","24","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (CLE)\"","\"|\"","85","63","\"CLE\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","\"32.3\"","\"47.7\"","\"43.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","20","20","40","55","50","60","45","40","45","55","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","50","65","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["933","930","870","954","483","\"42.1\"","\"42.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.4\"","\"36.0\"","\"50.6\"","\"|\"","\"Juan\"","\"Pie\"","2019","\"18.2\"","\"RF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2761","678607","","","\"sa3005531\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","40","\"rWlW72udRo4\"","","\"Until the late pickup of Ji-Hwan Bae, Pie was the top international signing for the Pirates, with a $500,000 bonus in the 2017 international signing period, the club's first after the dismissal of international director Rene Gayo. Pie was seen as a tools gamble, with classic everyday right field upside but crudeness typical for his age and build.   He quickly shed much of that crudeness in a loud pro debut this summer in the DSL. Pie showed a little bit of everything, and we think the upside is that of a 5 hit, 6 power, 5 run/defense type everday right fielder, but it's still early to be projecting a 5 bat with any certainty given that Pie hasn't played stateside yet. That said, there are prospects in the Top 100-- who went in the first round in 2018 -- who have this kind of upside, and Pie could be alongside them if he can repeat this kind of performance for the next few years.\"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","","\"July 3, 2017 - PIT\"","2023","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 45 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  The international amateur market is often considered a long-term lottery ticket. Often they don't pan out, but sometimes that ticket gets turned into a star. The Pirates gave Pie $500,000 in the 2017-18 signing period to sign in the hopes that his offensive tools will allow him to approach that latter development. His pro debut in the Dominican Summer League was a strong first step in that direction.  Pie's combination of athleticism and offensive potential give him the chance to be a dynamic outfielder if it all comes together. He's shown a solid approach at the plate, especially given his age, with a willingness to draw walks and manage his strikeout rate relatively well. His ground-ball rate was pretty low as well, and the 22 extra-base hits he collected might be the tip of the iceberg in terms of his ability to drive the ball. Pie runs well, though he has a lot to learn in terms of baserunning, and he saw time in all three outfield positions in the DSL.  The Pirates are excited to see what Pie can do as he comes stateside for the first time.

As a freshman at TCU, it appeared as though he might single-handedly drive national interest in college baseball as an Ohtani-like two-way force. His injury woes began the following year when he suffered a fracture of, and ligament and muscle tear in, his left arm. The following year he missed a few games after taking a bad hop to the face, and he'd later be shut down for the season when he fractured a fibula and tore an ankle ligament while sliding into second base. When on the field, the Kaiju-sized Baker has performed. He walked more than he struck out at TCU and tapped into much of his parking-lot-threatening power.

After one year pitching and hitting, an arm strain led to him focusing on his offensive skills. While productive, he's also had a string of scary injuries: a hairline fracture and ligament/muscle damage in his left arm in 2017, then a broken fibula and torn ankle ligaments in his left leg as a junior last spring. The Cardinals liked Baker's power potential enough to take him No. 75 overall, and he returned to health and reached full-season ball quickly during his pro debut.  Baker has tremendous strength and leverage thanks to his 6-foot-4, 265-pound frame. Coupled with good bat speed, he has legitimate power to all fields and finished his three-year college career with a .347 average, 28 home runs and 129 RBIs. There is some length in Baker's right-handed swing, but he has advanced barrel control and is comfortable hitting to all fields. His advanced approach led to more walks than strikeouts during his TCU career, and he demonstrated patience and managed the zone well even when he was pitched around.  A solid athlete for his size, Baker is nonetheless limited as a runner and defender. He does have a plus arm that once delivered low-90s fastballs, but he is decidedly a first baseman only.

His stuff was back last year. Wahl's fastball sits in the mid-90s and will touch 99. He has a four-pitch mix but works primarily with the fastball and a power, mid-80s breaking ball that has bat-missing vertical action. A firm cutter and changeup are also folded in on occasion.

He made his big league debut in 2017, though he again missed time with a right shoulder injury, ultimately undergoing surgery to address Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. He was back and strong in Triple-A in '18 and made it back up to the big leagues with the Mets after he was sent to New York in the Jeurys Familia trade. He pitched to mixed results but showcased impressive stuff during his brief time in New York, and the Brewers acquired him in the offseason Keon Broxton trade.   Finally healthy, Wahl sat at 95-96 mph and topped out at 98 with his high-spin heater while making seven appearances out of the Mets' bullpen. His power curveball in the mid-80s plays above average and is a true swing-and-miss pitch, though at times it varies in terms of shape and bite. Wahl also has feel for an average cutter that hovers around 89-90 mph and mixes in the occasional changeup, a distant fourth pitch. The effort in his delivery leads to below-average fastball command, but with elite velocity and spin, he also has a larger margin for error.

His arm action is a little rough, and Teng's lower slot makes it hard for him to get on top of his curveball consistently, but he's very well balanced over his blocking leg and otherwise has a smooth delivery. At this age and size, it's possible no more than the low-90s velo will come, but that might be enough if that curveball matures, because Teng's changeup is also very good. His timeline to the bigs has more to do with Minnesota's need to add him to the 40-man, which means we probably won't see him in the big leagues until Teng is comfortably in his mid-20s, even if he makes progress.

That has continued since he joined the Reds in the 2015 Trade Deadline deal for Mike Leake, though he did make his big-league debut in 2017. But in 2018, most of Mella's season was spent at Double-A before brief stints back in Triple-A and the Majors. His season ended a little early out of precaution because of a left oblique strain.  Mella has a plus fastball that is in the 91-97 mph range, but he can consistently reach for the bigger number when he needs it. He can supplement with an often better-than-average changeup and an average slider. Though he made strides in 2018 with a higher strikeout rate, he also saw his walk rate elevate and his command and control remain fringy.  At the moment, Mella seems projected for the back end of a rotation. However, his development time to returning to the big leagues longer term would be likely shortened by a move to the bullpen.

Fernandez runs well enough to steal an occasional base and cover ground in the outfield. He's seen almost all of his time defensively in the outfield corners, with enough arm for right.

Since college, Boldt's swing has evolved in a way that better incorporates his lower half. It has more scoop, more ability to catch pitches in, and he's better able to lift balls that are down. Supporting evidence can be found by observing Boldt's batted ball profile, as his groundball rate is now close to league average instead of well above it. Though he thickened quickly in college, Boldt is still an above-average runner once he gets underway. His slow first few steps prevent him from everyday viability in center field, and Boldt saw more time in the outfield corners last year than at any other time during his career.

While some teams preferred him on the mound (Breaux would touch 98 and his sawed off arm action and the cadence of his delivery are reminiscent of Jason Motte, himself a converted catcher) or were inclined to develop Breaux as a two-way prospect, the Yankees selected him to catch. Two-way duty in college means Breaux is currently raw as a receiver and a hitter, but he has a rare opportunity to become an impact bat behind the plate if he can start recognizing pro breaking stuff.

The consensus top junior college prospect after turning down the Astros as a 36th-rounder in 2017, he slammed 37 homers in two seasons at McLennan (Texas) CC. He also reached 100 mph with his fastball as a reliever for the Highlanders, though elbow issues limited him to four innings and prevented him for catching for a month as a sophomore.  Extremely aggressive at the plate, Breaux has well above-average bat speed, strength and raw power. While his approach has yet to result in excessive strikeouts, pro pitchers exploited it and held him homerless and to a lot of weak contact in his 30-game debut last summer. He had shown that his pop will play with wood bats and against better competition when he ranked fifth in the Cape Cod League with six homers in 2017.  Though Breaux improved significantly behind the plate from his freshman year to his sophomore year at McLennan, he still requires more polish to become a dependable receiver. Despite his pure arm strength, he threw out just nine percent of basestealers in his first taste of pro ball and won't be able to control the running game until he improves his throwing accuracy. Pitching is less of a fallback than it might seem because he has a violent delivery that would make it difficult to keep him healthy.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A\"","20","\"2018 Draft Rnd 2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","15","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"42.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","30","40","65","40","50","65","30","45","65","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","55","20","60","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["944","941","883","951","762","\"42.0\"","\"42.3\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.8\"","\"41.2\"","\"48.4\"","\"|\"","\"Brett\"","\"Cumberland\"","2019","\"23.9\"","\"C\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","1735","656340","\"cumberland_brett\"","","\"sa915611\"","\"|\"","","\"Cal\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2019","40","\"5G6gKGKiphs\"","","\"As an amateur at Cal, Cumberland was seen as an fringe-to-average bat with above average power, questionable catcher defense, and arm strength that may push him to first base. The Braves drafted him in the second compensation round for an overslot bonus, using the pick they bought from Baltimore in exchange for Brian Matusz's contract. Eventually, and ironically, Atlanta traded him to Baltimore as part of the multi-player return for Kevin Gausman and Darren' O'Day's contract. Since signing, Cumberland's defense and pop times have improved, due in part to a slimmed-down physique and in part to improved throwing mechanics that make the most of his average arm strength. We think he'll be able to catch part time and also have enough of a bat to contribute at first base, DH, or as a pinch hitter. He's moved down a bit for us since last season as his strong start and improved defense early in 2018 tailed off a bit later in the season, which is somewhat common for players who are dealing with physical change during the longest full-time catching spell of their lives. Some scouts questioned Cumberland's bat control and thus his hit tool and game power in late 2018 looks, so looks early in 2019 may tell us if this was a slight regression in tools, or just temporary fatigue he can get past. The likely outcome looks like a valuable switch-hitting backup catcher whose bat you want to get in the lineup most days, which we value the same we would a low-end regular.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2016, CBB (76) - ATL\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 40  A Draft-eligible sophomore out of California when the Braves took him in the Competitive Balance Round B in 2016, Cumberland cemented his profile as a bat-first backstop with a solid first full season that saw him play across two levels of A ball. After reaching Double-A for the first time, the Braves dealt him with Juan Carlos Encarnacion, Evan Phillips and Bruce Zimmermann to the Orioles for Kevin Gausman at the Trade Deadline.  Cumberland has shown that his power will play. That's especially true from the left side of the plate, where his pop is at least average and he's hit all but two of his home runs as a pro, though he has 45 power from the right side as well. There is some swing and miss, and he's never going to hit for more than average, but he's also willing to be selective in waiting for a pitch to drive, with the ultimate goal of lifting the ball in the air.  Cumberland is less advanced defensively, but he has made progress and worked hard behind the plate. After throwing out roughly 22 percent of attempted basestealers in his first full season, he pushed that number up to 40 percent in 2018. He'll never wow anyone back there, but there is confidence he'll be capable enough to stay there.

Verdugo's defensive ability was in place when he arrived for camp in the spring. By the start of the summer, he had already filled out a bit and started putting a serious charge into the baseball during BP and, occasionally, in games. That thump tapered off later in the year and Verdugo has some swing length issues that will likely make him strikeout prone, but it's possible he was just tired in August and that there's some pop here, too.

Despite below-average speed out of the batter's box, Verdugo has the athleticism and actions to stick at shortstop. His plus arm and quick hands are assets, and he possesses a precise internal clock that helps him make plays. He handled third base well last summer and theoretically could play second base if he wound up in a utility role.   Verdugo prioritizes power at the plate and shows pop to all fields.

When he came out of high school, he was still coming back from Tommy John surgery and concussions kept him off the field in Champaign for much of his first two seasons. A healthy and robust junior season in 2018 saw Spillane lead Division I hitters in slugging percentage and OPS, while hitting 23 homers. He was named 2018 Big Ten Player of the Year and became the highest-drafted position player in program history when the Reds took him in the third round and signed him at below-slot value.    In the Pioneer League, Spillane's plus raw power was on display. While he had a lengthy swing and 41 percent strikeout rate, he has some bat speed and there was a different sound and impact when he made contact with the baseball. His other offensive skills fall in the fringy-to-average range and he missed some time when he was banged up late in the season.    Spillane does somewhat offset his high strikeout rate with an ability to draw walks, and he's expected to likely be a power-over-hit offensive player. A first baseman in college, Spillane is athletic and received more playing time in right field than first base during his first pro summer in the Reds organization.

He returned for his junior year and came on strong, albeit not at full speed, as the 2018 Draft approached, landing in the fourth round.   Keirsey had a strong pro debut, hitting over .300 in the Appalachian League and showing a solid approach at the plate, one that had Twins scout Tim O'Neill, one of the best hitting evaluators in the organization, excited about picking him. Keirsey has excellent bat to ball skills and makes consistent contact. It's a line-drive approach, for the most part, but there is some extra-base authority to tap into from the left side of the plate. Now healthy, Keirsey can work to recapture the plus speed that was such a big part of his game before the injury. That speed, graded as a 70 on the 20-to-80 scale by some, could allow him to steal bases and cover plenty of ground in the outfield.  Keirsey has the skillset to play center field regularly, but with some outfield depth in the lower levels of the Minors, he's likely to play all three spots so he can get at-bats.

After hitting .491 with a .611 OBP and six home runs during his senior year at Hattiesburg (Miss.) High, Gray became the program's first player to be drafted since 2007, going to the Brewers in the second round. He passed on a University of Mississippi commitment to sign for slot value ($1,113,500), and then began his pro career in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Gray has two loud tools in his raw power and arm strength. With his lightning-fast bat and his physical strength, he can hammer balls out of the park to all fields from the right side of the plate. His arm strength was among the best among 2018 high school position players, having been clocked at 98 mph from the outfield at the Perfect Game National showcase after his junior year, though his accuracy sometimes leaves something to be desired. He has solid speed and takes good routes in center field, giving him a chance to play there in pro ball.  That Gray has swing-and-miss concerns and has been inconsistent against quality pitchers leads some scouts to question whether he'll ever hit enough to get to his power and unlock his full potential.

Kahle has been hitting with a lot of confidence all spring, giving scouts hope he'll hit for average at the next level. He's shown the ability to catch up to good fastballs with solid bat speed and recognizes breaking stuff well, which he's gotten a lot of as teams have pitched around him. He tends to show mostly gap power, but he does stay inside the ball well and shows some ability to turn on pitches for some home run power. Short and stocky, Kahle is a below-average runner and doesn't have that much agility behind the plate.

Maciel picked up baseball mostly because he had Japanese neighbors, so his fundamentals are understandably raw. Still, the D-backs saw enough potential in the outfielder to give him $90,000 to sign in October 2015 and the Twins liked him enough to acquire him close to last year's Trade Deadline in the Eduardo Escobar deal.  Maciel has shown off certain tools in the early stages of his career, most notably his speed and ability to defend. He does manage the strike zone fairly well, limiting his strikeouts and drawing some walks, which gives the switch-hitter the chance to hit for average as he progresses. He's fairly strong for his size, but he needs to add more to truly impact the ball consistently and he'd have to alter his swing path in order to have any real power, something that has not shown up yet. A very good defender in center field, Maciel uses his speed well to run down fly balls, and could be an even more effective base stealer in time.  The Twins are optimistic there's more growth to come from Maciel given his lack of experience before he entered pro ball.

On the one hand, he's a switch-hitting middle infielder who has made lots of contact -- Leyba is a .285 career hitter -- over six pro seasons. On the other, he has been hurt a lot -- shoulder surgery, most recently -- and may be painted into too small a defensive corner to be rosterable if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular. It's important to be mindful of prospect fatigue creeping in here, as Leyba really broke out during the summer of 2014 when as a teenager, he hit a combined .323 in the Penn and Midwest Leagues. He was sent to Arizona as part of the three-way, Didi Gregorius-headlined trade that offseason, had a bad 2015 in the Cal League, bounced back in 2016, and has basically been hurt since.   Because of Leyba's size and lack of power, he has to keep making high-end rates of contact to profile as an everyday player. If he lacks sufficient arm strength for shortstop coming out of the shoulder surgery, it puts even more pressure on the hit tool, because a bench role is less feasible for someone without defensive versatility.\"","\"|\"","","\"ARI\"","","\"July 2, 2012 - DET\"","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  Acquired as part of the three-team trade in the Dec. 2014 that sent him and Robbie Ray from Detroit to Arizona and made Didi Gregorius a Yankee, Leyba's stock was on the rise two years later when he hit .301 as a 20-year-old in Double-A as part of a breakout campaign that earned him a spot on the D-backs' 40-man roster. His development was stalled in 2017 as shoulder surgery cost him all but 23 games. He made a healthy return to Double-A last spring and ultimately garnered honors as the Southern League Championship Series MVP while leading Jackson to a title.   Leyba has plus bat-to-ball skills which enable him to make a lot of quality contact from both sides of the plate. His natural hitting ability has improved along with his plate discipline, and he's shown more of a willingness to take walks while striking out less. He may never be a huge power guy, but the improved approach has Leyba starting to tap into his raw power, albeit mostly from the left side. While he's played mostly shortstop, he's shown he can more than handle second base.

He had a tough pro debut with unlucky injuries, streaky hitting, and poor coaching, which he responded poorly to in turn, bristling at the criticism that came with not meeting expectations. Jackson was traded to the Braves, who moved him back behind the plate in an attempt to build some value since his bat no longer profiled as the 6 hit/6 power that was projected out of high school. He made great strides as a catcher in 2018 and now looks likely to be an average-or-close-to-it receiver with a plus arm and plus plus raw power. He's gotten much bigger since high school and isn't a runner, and his lessened twitch quickness also makes him more of a mistake hitter at the plate.

He had trouble gaining any traction, and following a 2016 season in the Midwest League, the Mariners sent him to the Braves in the trade for Max Povse and Rob Whalen. Atlanta moved Jackson back behind the plate, and while he hasn't hit consistently, he did make it to Triple-A in 2018 and was added to the 40-man roster in the offseason.  Since joining the Braves, Jackson's power has shown up on occasion, hitting 19 homers in 2017, then five more in the Arizona Fall League that offseason. That didn't carry over to 2018, where his approach regressed and his strikeout rate jumped over 30 percent, keeping him from tapping into his plus raw pop. On the positive side, Jackson's work behind the plate has improved markedly. He's always had a strong arm but had struggled with receiving. His blocking remains a work in progress, and given his size, he's not very agile. He has gotten better at framing after watching a lot of video of fellow Braves catcher Tyler Flowers, who is similarly built.  Jackson is still only 23 years old, but his ceiling is very limited.

There's no modern precedent for a pitcher like Young. 14-year veteran righty Chris Young has a similar build but was a superior athlete, and Kyle and Chris differ mechanically and stylistically so much that they're not really comparable past their frames.\"","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","\"2016, 22nd (647) - PHI\"","","2021","45","\"Scouting Grades: Fastball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 45  There's an assumption that a pitcher who stands nearly seven feet tall is going to be a flame-thrower, a la Randy Johnson. Young, who got an over-slot bonus of $225,000 to sign out of the Long Island, N.Y., high school ranks as a 22nd-rounder in 2016, bucks conventional wisdom by thriving thanks to his feel for pitching, not his pure stuff. Elbow inflammation limited him to just under 60 total innings in what was supposed to be his full-season debut in 2018, but he's been given a clean bill of health.  Young uses his long levers and his outstanding command to allow him to succeed despite not having eye-popping stuff. Velocity-wise, his fastball is below-average, thrown in the 86-91 mph range, but it's on the plate when he releases it, he throws it with excellent life to elicit ground-ball outs and commands it well, all of which makes it play up. He mixes in an average breaking ball and changeup as well, though he needs to continue to work on the consistency of his secondary stuff.  As Young continues to add strength to his enormous frame, there is the chance he could add a few ticks to his fastball. But it's really going to be his height, life, deception, command and feel to pitch that will carry him up the organizational ladder.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PHI\"","\"A+\"","26","\"2016 Draft Rnd 22 (PHI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","","50","","","","60","","",""],["958","955","982","934","834","\"41.7\"","\"41.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.3\"","\"35.8\"","\"48.3\"","\"|\"","\"Helcris\"","\"Olivarez\"","2019","\"18.8\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"192\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","3221","","","","\"sa3002965\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","\"107F9pqncng\"","","\"Olivarez has had trouble throwing strikes during at least a few of his Extended starts, but he has enviable stuff and physical projection for a teenage lefty.

Jones is still an elite athlete with a strong 6-foot-4 frame and plus-plus speed. He shows the potential to be a prolific basestealer, but only if he can get on base much more consistently. A right-handed hitter, he remains raw with his offensive approach, strikes out too frequently and makes too much weak contact when he does put the ball in play.  Jones also needs to refine his reads and routes in center field, though his quickness allows him to outrun many of his mistakes.

He furthered that reputation during his professional debut by hitting .335 en route to honors as a Dominican Summer League All-Star, then raked at a .348 clip in 2018 while making his United States debut in the Gulf Coast League. And when Double-A Springfield needed a fill-in catcher at the end of the Minor League season, it was 18-year-old Herrera who got the call, and he held his own in his lone Texas League start.   Herrera is an advanced hitter for his age, with a short, efficient swing and mature approach that has led evaluators to peg him as an average hitter. His swing is more conducive for driving balls into the gaps, though he could develop fringy over-the-fence pop as he adds strength and learns to leverage his swing a bit. He identifies pitches well, recognizing spin better than most teenagers, and generally does a good job controlling the strike zone.   As with many teenage catchers, Herrera's bat is currently ahead of his defense.

Three years later, his scouting reports read pretty much the same and he has the same upside in the Draft. He has a big arm that produces inconsistent results, as evidenced in early April when he gave up nine runs against Texas Tech and then struck out a career-high 14 against Oklahoma State in his next start.    Zeferjahn is capable of working with a 93-96 mph fastball as a starter and has climbed as high as 98, though there are games where he'll operate at 90-93. His heater is fairly straight considering he throws from a low-three-quarters slot, an angle that makes it tough for him to stay on top of his slider, which ranges anywhere from 80-87 mph and from a below-average slurve to a plus offering with hard bite. His changeup grades better than his slider at times, though it also lacks consistency.    Zeferjahn is athletic but tends to get under his pitches, costing him control and quality. He doesn't have a track record of throwing strikes, leading several scouts to project a move the bullpen, where he could regularly feature a double-plus fastball in shorter stints.

(Erceg pitched in college at Cal and then, after he transferred, closed at Menlo.) When Erceg is going at the plate, he's dropping the bat head and golfing out pitches down and in, or flaying pitches away from him down the third base line for a double. But as his career has drawn on, his swing is often ill-timed and its components don't seem to be cohesive. He's also not extending through contact as dramatically as he was in college.

He reached full-season ball in pro debut, then delivered 15 homers and 33 doubles while ranking among the high Class A Carolina League leaders with 81 RBIs (first) and 207 total bases (second) in his first full season. Advancing to Double-A in 2018, Erceg struggled to find the same consistency on both sides of the ball that he'd shown the previous year.  Erceg has the physical tools to be an impactful left-handed hitter, including natural feel to hit and plus raw power that generates booming home runs. He frequently expanded his zone and made too much weak, often popped-up contact in 2018, and the Brewers believe he'll get back to his strengths after lowering the launch angle of his swing. Otherwise, Erecg's bat-to-ball skills, plate coverage and easy power are still there. He doesn't strike out much but will need to tighten his approach and become more selective. Defensively, Erceg is generally considered to be an athletic third baseman, with hands, footwork and plus-plus arm strength -- one that fired 93-94 mph fastballs as Menlo's closer -- though he still has gains to make in his overall consistency.  After a physically taxing 2018 season, Erceg spent the offseason training at the Brewers' spring complex in Florida, with his eyes set on beginning 2019 in peak condition.

That's even more true when that catcher hailed from a cold-weather state. The Twins knew all of this when they took Rortvedt in the second round of the 2016 Draft out of the Wisconsin prep ranks. His defensive work has been exemplary and he took a step forward with the bat in 2018, playing across two levels of Class A.  There are few questions about Rortvedt's ability to defend at this point. He's an outstanding blocker and receiver, with some thinking he'll be a plus defender overall. His above-average arm plays up because of its accuracy and his ability to transfer quickly as well as throwing from his feet or his knees, as he's thrown out 32.6 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. There could be more in Rortvedt's left-handed bat as well. While he's big and strong, he employs a more conservative, contact-first swing. He did improve offensively in 2018, but the Twins would like to see him let loose a little more to unlock more of his raw power.

In retrospect that looks a little silly, as the 2015 class included Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis, Jr., Cristian Pache, and Andres Gimenez, but that opinion was the consensus amongst many top evaluators; those five superior prospects all received lower bonuses than Maitan for a reason.   Maitan signed with Atlanta as the clear top prospect in his class, and the clear top prospect to emerge in many years. Then things took a turn for him as a pro. Maitan added some natural strength and bulk soon after signing (which many scouts anticipated, projecting him to a corner), then started adding some bad weight, lost his swing mechanics, and started tinkering. Things snowballed from there, ending in a disappointing debut season with Atlanta. After that season, the Braves international scandal hit, and Maitan became a free agent. He kept his original $4.25 million bonus (widely reported to have been topped by multiple clubs late in the process, though he and his family chose to honor their word to Atlanta) and hit the open market, where he received $2.2 million amid some scouts' suggestions that he wasn't even the best of the Braves' prospects to be cut loose.   The same issues continued with Los Angeles in 2018, and Maitan had another disappointing season, with a worrisome physique and an evolving swing. The raw tools that originally got scouts interested -- raw power you can project to a 70, a 65-grade arm, infield hands, feel to hit -- still appear to be in there and Angels sources indicate Maitan spent the offseason getting in better shape, a process they anticipated would be slow from the onset, hopefully foreshadowing a breakout year. The organization is excited about what could happen in 2019, with Maitan as part of an exciting Low-A Burlington club that should include him, Jeremiah Jackson, and Livan Soto in the infield and Jordyn Adams, D'Shawn Knowles, and Trent Deveaux in the outfield. We have Maitan here on pedigree, as pro socuts outside the org who had no context for their eval barely considered him a prospect last year.\"","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","","\"Dec. 16, 2017 - LAA\"","2022","45","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 65 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45    As the No. 1 international prospect according to MLB Pipeline at the start of the 2016-17 prospect, one signed by the Braves for $4.25 million that July and immediately compared to the likes of Miguel Sano and Miguel Cabrera, Maitan came with huge expectations. There was more of a spotlight on him in November 2017 when he was declared a free agent as part of the penalty levied against the Braves for violating international signing rules. The Angels swooped in and gave Maitan $2.2 million to join the organization and sent him out as an 18-year-old in the Pioneer League.    While the overall numbers look pedestrian, the Angels were pleased with how Maitan competed against largely older players, notching 22 extra-base hits and a solid hard-hit percentage. They believe the power is for real and have seen the teenager continue to improve his athleticism and strength training. He also improved defensively, seeing time at both shortstop and third. While his lack of speed has most believing he has no shot at playing shortstop at higher levels, he'll continue to get reps and multiple positions so he can see the ball from different spots and angles on the infield.    Maitan hasn't lit the world on fire like some top international prospects have in recent years. But he's also just 19 years old and ready to attack full-season baseball, with the Angels eager to see how he handles the challenge of aggressive assignments.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","\"A\"","24","\"2016 J2 (ATL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.5\"","\"48.2\"","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","-1.0","\"|\"","25","30","55","40","40","60","45","45","60","40","50","65","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","40","65","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"PHI\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["971","968","1053","922","1172","\"41.5\"","\"40.6\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.8\"","\"35.5\"","\"44.5\"","\"|\"","\"Korry\"","\"Howell\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"CF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","3192","","","","\"sa3008238\"","\"|\"","","\"Kirkwood JC (IA)\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","\"G7MNiq2Aqso\"","","\"Howell was a pleasant, toolsy, post-draft surprise whose combination of speed and crude bat control was too much for AZL defenses to deal with.

Gomez is a mature-bodied prospect and a 30 runner presently, someone who appears 'unathletic' on the surface. We often talk about football and baseball athleticism as being two different things, and Gomez is not football athletic, but definitely is baseball athletic. Instead of timed speed or visible strength, he displays quick-twich movement, first step quickness, and overall explosion through strength in the forearms, wrists, and hands. Gomez is an ideal case study in the differences, as he's got soft hands and is mobile behind the plate, and has solid average raw power with similarly graded bat control. The Yankees may have a 5 defensive catcher with a 5 bat, 5 raw power, and an 8 arm here.

He's a below average runner, thrower and defender, but plays a passable second base for now. Dunn may get shifted to left field or just a general 'bat that you find a spot for' position, because he's one of the few college hitters in his draft class who drew near consensus 60 hit grades. He has average raw power that he doesn't tap into as often as you'd like, so there's some shot for a swing adjustment (think more aggressive mechanics and/or more lofted swing path) that could make him some version of Daniel Murphy. Or, if he continues on this path with only his hit tool rating above average, he could be more of a Tommy LaStella bench bat type. There's obviously plenty of space between those two ends of the spectrum and the Murphy outcome is obviously a longshot, but in today's game, we feel obliged to outline a best case scenario with so many advanced hitters finding game power we didn't foresee.\"","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2018, 5th (153) - STL\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 45 | Arm: 40 | Field: 45 | Overall: 40  A three-year starter at Maryland, Dunn stood out in the wood bat Cape Cod League, earning All-Star honors for two years in a row, and he had a strong junior campaign in 2018, hitting for average and more power than he had previously in his career. The Cardinals took Dunn in the fifth round that June, signed him for $310,000 and watched him reach Class A Peoria in his pro debut.  Dunn has a knack for making contact from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach and very good plate discipline that allowed him to walk more than he struck out in his college career. The infielder reached double-digits in home runs as a junior, nearly doubling his total over his first two years combined, but projects for more extra-base pop than true over-the-fence power as a pro. Dunn's below-average arm strength and fringy speed limits him to second base, where he has decent range and makes all the routine plays.  The Cardinals have a strong track record of turning bat-first college players into productive big leaguers.

A transfer from Bellevue Junior College the year prior, Shenton really struggled out of the gate, at least in part under the weight of his mother undergoing cancer treatments across the country, but he started to swing the bat better as the spring wore on.  Shenton does have a really good left-handed swing when he's at his best, using the whole field well, giving some the belief he'll hit for average at the next level. After he started slowly, he might have tried too hard to catch up and was jumping at the ball and wasn't on time with his swing during games, though he did reel off a long hitting streak to bring his average up. There's some pull power to tap into, though he's definitely a hit over power type of offensive player. With a thicker build, Shenton's range is a little limited, and a hamstring injury this spring didn't help, but he has the chance to be adequate at third with a solid arm. If third doesn't work, he could be an offensive-minded second baseman or perhaps handle left field.  Scouts who like Shenton and think the guy they saw in the Cape is who he is see a little Kyle Seager in him, though his slow start may have turned some teams off.

His 2018 started well with that March showing, but his stateside regular season debut was a disaster, with 4% walks, 28% strikeouts, and a 48 wRC+ in 53 games at Rookie-Advanced Pulaski.

His mechanics didn't break down and he's still a teenager with plenty of time to adjust, but now poor plate discipline is something to watch going forward, to see if those bad habits can change or end up limiting his offensive upside.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"A-\"","26","\"2016 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"33.6\"","\"50.5\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","25","20","50","50","40","45","50","50","55","45","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["979","976","797","929","395","\"41.5\"","\"42.8\"","\"40.0\"","\"49.9\"","\"49.1\"","\"50.0\"","\"|\"","\"Garrett\"","\"Cooper\"","2019","\"28.4\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","2669","","","15279","\"sa737833\"","\"|\"","","\"Auburn\"","-1","0","","\"Med\"","2019","40","","","\"A wrist injury jettisoned Cooper's 2018, when he might otherwise have had an extended big league opportunity due to Justin Bour's departure.

There's some power here, but Viloria has to sell out to get to it in games because his swing's not naturally geared for lift. Instead, he leans into a contact-oriented approach, and generates his power through strength in his hands.   On defense, Viloria has one hell of an arm, but the rest of his catching traits are only okay.

Because of his potential on both sides of the ball, some evaluators think Viloria has the chance to be an everyday catcher in the big leagues. He's shown an advanced approach from the left side of the plate and doesn't strike out much. While it hasn't shown up much in the stat line yet, there is some raw power for him to tap into. Viloria has a very strong arm behind the plate, one that has thrown out 35.7 percent of potential basestealers. He's a good blocker, but the rest of his receiving needs to get more consistent. At times, he'll be very good, then he'll do something like let a fastball tip off his glove.  Viloria's tendency to see himself as an offensive-minded catcher has kept him from developing all of his skills fully.

Not only is he coordinated and acrobatic, but his throws to first sizzle through the air, even with just a flick of his wrist. He has one of the best infield arms in the minors and should be an above-average defender at maturity. At the plate, he lacks even a modicum of strength and has near bottom-of-the-scale power from both sides of the plate. He's a competent slash and dash hitter, but that's becoming less common, even at shortstop. Tigers fans who visit this site are likely acquainted with Jose Iglesias' player page. Iglesias was a better defender than Alcantara (and, well, just about everybody) and had better feel for contact with similar power, and is someone we'd ideally have as a 45 or 50 on prospect lists based on his' WAR production. Logically, Alcantara needs to be beneath those tiers.

Martinez in July 2017. Of the trio, it is Alcantara who is the only sure-fire shortstop, having long impressed with his stellar glove and arm strength at the position. He made progress at the plate at Double-A in 2018, finishing with a .271 average in his first taste of the level, though the jury is still very much out if he'll ever hit enough to be an everyday player.   Alcantara is a model defender at shortstop with his cannon arm and slick glove. Though only an average runner, he has plenty of range because he has quick feet and an instinctual first step that consistently puts him in position to make plays. Offensively, the switch-hitter demonstrates a knack for making contact from both sides of the plate, with a more disciplined approach as a lefty. His feel for the barrel produces mostly line drives and ground balls, and it's unlikely that Alcantara will ever have enough strength to hit more than the occasional home run.  Since power will never be a part of his game, it's crucial that Alcantara continues developing as a hitter, with an emphasis on refining his approach and improving the quality of his contact on both sides of the plate. While unlocking Alcantara's potential with the bat could push him into consideration as an everyday player, his best fit long-term in the big leagues is as a defensive-minded utilityman who helps wins games with his glove.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","\"AA\"","17","\"2012 J2 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","14","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"35.5\"","\"46.4\"","\"36.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","35","20","30","50","50","70","55","30","30","50","60","70","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","20","50","70","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"NYM\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["983","980","964","918","820","\"41.4\"","\"41.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.4\"","\"38.6\"","\"48.2\"","\"|\"","\"Chris\"","\"Betts\"","2019","\"22.2\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1269","663341","\"betts_chris\"","","\"sa874791\"","\"|\"","","\"Wilson HS (CA)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","40","","","\"Betts was one of the most heavily-scouting prep prospects in recent memory, maturing early as a catcher with a plus arm and plus raw power from a strong prep program in Long Beach, CA that has produced five first round picks, including Aaron Hicks.

He's currently throwing about an inning per week for Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League. Peak prospect De la Cruz would show you a plus fastball and breaking ball consistently, as well as some feel for a changeup. Because of all the lost reps due to various injuries over the last several years, his development has been slow.

He had trouble staying healthy, however, missing large chunks of '16 with forearm soreness and '17 with a pectoral strain. His stuff dipped last year before he tested positive for a banned diuretic and masking agent, drawing an 80-game suspension that will carry into the beginning of '19.  At his best, De La Cruz has shown a 91-97 mph fastball with life and angle to go with a plus curveball that combines power and depth. In 2018, he sat more in the low 90s with his fastball and had trouble staying on top of his curveball because his arm slot wandered too much. He also has flashed a solid changeup at times but it wasn't as effective last season.  De La Cruz's control and command backed up in 2018 as well, in large part because he couldn't maintain a consistent arm angle.

A two-way player who was going to head to Miami, the Dodgers took him in the fourth round and gave him second-round money to sign him, as a pitcher, away from joining the Hurricanes. He was in his first full year with the Dodgers in 2018 when they sent him to the Reds in early July.  Marinan's velocity spike brought his upper-80s fastball to one that typically sits 92-96 mph with some sink. He has two distinct breaking pitches, an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a sweeping slider. The curve will flash plus, but is inconsistent as he sometimes has trouble commanding the pitch. His changeup, which he rarely used in high school, is now his best secondary offering in terms of its consistency.  Marinan has the chance to add strength to his large 6-foot-5 frame and while he's still learning to find the strike zone regularly, he has the athleticism to be able to repeat his delivery in the future.

After splitting much of '18 between Double-A and Triple-A, Hanhold had his contract purchased by the Mets and made his debut as a September callup, only to leave his third relief appearance with a strained left oblique muscle.   Hanhold spent the first year-plus of his pro career giving starting a try, but it didn't really take, and a 2017 move to the bullpen suited him and allowed his power arsenal to play up. The big right-hander will now touch 98 mph with excellent life on his fastball, and he missed more bats than he had previously in his career during his first season in the Mets' system. He pairs a slider, which flashes plus and touches 91 mph, with his heater, giving him more than enough for him to hold down a short relief role.

Stevenson's penchant for drawing walks and reaching base has followed him throughout his career. His feel for the strike zone is as good as any player in the system, and he's advanced in his ability to recognize pitches. Stevenson has hitting ability, too, with a knack for finding the barrel and staying inside the ball that enable him to rope line drives to all fields. Power will never be a big part of Stevenson's game, but he does have consistent pop to the gaps, with speed that fuels his extra-base potential and earns him praise as one of the organization's better baserunners.  Club officials also see Stevenson as one of the system's better defensive outfielders, noting that he gets great reads off the bat and has instincts that allow him to get the most of his abilities.

Tall, lanky, cold-weather arms often develop late; small-college players are typically a little behind large conference peers; and malleable athletes are  frequently able to make adjustments throughout their entire careers. Sharp is all of these. Originally from Michigan, he pitched at three colleges in three years (Eastern Michigan, Darton State College, and Drury University) in front of various groups of area scouts before he was drafted late in 2016. Sharp is also an ectomorphic 6-foot-4, and his limbs distract and also aid in his down-mound extension, enabling his fastball to sneak up on hitters more often than one would expect given its fringe velocity. Sharp learned the grip for his sinker, which has helped him generate a nearly 60% ground ball rate over the last two years, by seeing Blake Treinen's grip on the internet. Scouts have also noted that he has begun to vary the timing of his delivery to disorient hitters,  la Johnny Cueto. He's clearly still developing and doing so quickly. His stuff -- the sinker, a good changeup, average slider -- looks like that of a swing man or up/down arm, and most pitchers this age with this kind of stuff don't end up on our lists. But that stuff might play up because of extension and deception and continue to improve as Sharp's body and feel for his craft evolve.

Taken by Washington in the 22nd round the following year, Sharp is looking like a Draft steal after making steady progress in each pro season en route to his first taste of Double-A in 2018.  A two-sport standout who could have played college basketball, Sharp's tremendous athleticism translates and gives him big upside on the mound. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has an exceptional sinker -- it has an average spin rate of about 1900 rpm -- that sits in the low 90s and nets him ground balls at an elite clip. His 59.7 percent ground-ball rate in 2018 was tops among qualified starters in the Nationals' farm system and ranked inside the top 10 in the entire Minors. Sharp pairs his heater with a quality changeup, giving him two above-average offerings, and the Nationals have been pleased with his development of a slider.  Sharp possesses average control and command because his athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and arm action so well. That feel for pounding the zone allows for Sharp's three-pitch mix to play up, and he's never had issues keeping the ball in the park.

Alemais' glove is so good that we consider him likely to play some kind of big league role, despite being unlikely to hit. His hands lack life; to Alemais' credit, he's done his best to find a way to hit the ball harder by taking high-effort swings, and he hasn't lost any contact ability in the process. This is an intense, hard-working athlete with some physical shortcomings that will likely limit his role, but he has elite defensive skill and is tough to strike out, which means he has a watered down version of Andrelton Simmons' skillset.\"","\"|\"","","\"PIT\"","\"2016, 3rd (105) - PIT\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 30 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 60 | Overall: 40  Finding players who can defend up the middle in the infield can be tough, and that's a big reason why the Pirates took Alemais in the third round of the 2016 Draft following a solid but unspectacular junior season at Tulane. After playing across two levels of A ball in his first full season, he had a strong year playing second base for Double-A Altoona in 2018.  There is no question Alemais can defend at the big league level. Alemais has the ability to make flashy plays consistently. He's certainly good enough to play shortstop, then showed in 2018 he could slide over to second in deference to Cole Tucker, and be a plus defender there as well. While Alemais occasionally still tries to muscle up at the plate too much, he has excellent hand-eye coordination and terrific bat-to-ball skills. He rarely strikes out and controls the strike zone well, albeit without any power.  The bilingual Alemais has spent the last two offseasons working with Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League, and it's obviously had a positive impact. It's crowded in the infield in the Pirates' upper levels, but Alemais' glove-first utility profile should help him contribute soon.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"PIT\"","\"AA\"","17","\"2016 Draft Rnd 3 (PIT)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","24","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"41.8\"","\"45.5\"","\"40.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","45","20","30","60","60","60","50","20","30","60","70","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","30","50","55","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1002","999","990","908","1058","\"41.1\"","\"41.2\"","\"40.0\"","\"45.4\"","\"34.2\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","\"Christopher\"","\"Morel\"","2019","\"19.9\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"140\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","2768","666624","","","\"sa3003171\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","40","","","\"Morel has visible on-field leadership qualities and was the vocal protagonist of an AZL club team that lost the league championship series to the Dodgers.

He did a better job of showcasing his all-around tools in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Morel has some of the best bat speed in the system but will need to add more muscle to his skinny frame before he can translate it into power. He has a nice right-handed swing and bat-to-ball skills, but his NWL experience showed he'll need to refine his approach at the plate. An average runner out of the batter's box, he's a step quicker once he gets going.  Morel's athleticism and solid arm strength give him a number of defensive options. He broke into pro ball as a shortstop and may have enough quickness to stay there.

He also has huge raw power that he doesn't often get to in games because Henry's bat path causes him to drive the ball into the ground at a 50% clip and he's also prone to swing and miss.

He showed promise on both sides of the ball the following year in the Rookie-level Pioneer League and continued to make strides in 2018 with the move up to Class A Wisconsin.  Henry generates above-average raw power from the right side of the plate. He's already shown some feel for applying it during games, too, hitting some of his farthest home runs to right-center field. While there is present swing-and-miss to his game, as well as some pull-side tendencies, Henry has an advanced approach that nets him walks and suggests he'll hit for more average as he matures.  In his first full season, Henry, who is praised for his energy and leadership skills behind the plate, threw out nearly 44 percent (46 of 105) of attempted basestealers and committed just six passed balls. A quick release and a strong, accurate arm help Henry to combat the running game, and club officials have been impressed with how he's developed a receiving style that utilizes his big, athletic frame.

While he did struggle a bit when he first got there, he did live up to the advanced billing by reaching Double-A in his first full season.  Seabold is all about mixing his pitches, his overall feel for pitching and his command, rather than pure stuff, with three offerings that typically grade out as average. He will show an above-average fastball on occasion, with a tweak to his delivery helping him add a tick, though he usually sits in the 90-93 range. He mixes in his average changeup effectively and he'll show an average breaking ball. His ability to keep hitters guessing and fill up the strike zone will continue to be key for him moving forward.  After initially struggling in Reading, Seabold made solid adjustments and pitched very well over the season's final month.

Peterson, Dustin went in the second round of the 2013 Draft out of his Arizona high school to the Padres. He was sent to the Braves in December 2014 as part of the Justin Upton trade and had a bit of a breakout offensively in 2016, though a hamate injury forced him out of the start of 2017 and seemed to negate any power gains he had made. He wasn't protected on the Braves' 40-man roster last offseason and wasn't taken in the Rule 5 Draft, but did get added to the roster when he made his brief big league debut in May. When the Braves designated him for assignment in September, the Tigers swooped in and claimed him off of waivers.  Fully healthy in 2018, Peterson looked more like the 2016 version of him, especially during a productive second half. That was the year he set career highs in just about every offensive category and took a big step forward in terms of tapping into his raw power. At his best, he mitigates a reasonable amount of strikeouts with a fair walk rate, especially given his power potential. An infielder originally, he's now an average defender in left field, one who also saw considerable time in right field in 2018 even though he has fringy arm strength.   Peterson is still young enough to show he can fulfill his potential as an everyday left fielder, where there will be pressure on the bat. But at this point, a career as a quality fourth or bench outfielder who provides power and run production might be more realistic.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"47.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","50","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"BAL\"","1.050","\"2nd\""],["1008","1005","1003","897","800","\"41.0\"","\"41.0\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"47.5\"","\"|\"","\"Jonathan\"","\"Stiever\"","2019","\"22.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2462","680692","\"stiever_jonathan\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","\"2018, 5th (138) - CWS\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 40  A Wisconsin all-state wide receiver and defensive back in high school, Stiever went from unheralded baseball recruit to Indiana's best pitching prospect since Brewers 2009 first-rounder Eric Arnett. Stiever became the Hoosiers' No. 1 starter as a sophomore and led the Big Ten Conference in strikeouts (97 in 100 1/3 innings) last spring before signing for $386,800 as a fifth-rounder. The White Sox kept him on tight pitch counts in his debut, but he did contribute a pair of scoreless three-inning outings in the Rookie-level Pioneer League playoffs as Great Falls won the championship.  Stiever's fastball sits in the low 90s and reaches 96 mph, playing as a plus pitch because it has a lot of run and sink and he leverages it down in the zone with downhill angle thanks to his high-three-quarters arm slot. He has nice feel for his upper-70s spike curveball, an offering many pitchers struggle to control, and can morph it into a harder slider when needed. His changeup is becoming more effective as he learns to trust it.  The athleticism that made Stiever a football standout translates well to the mound.

A sore elbow shelved him for the second half of 2014, but once he shook the rust off, he started to show exactly that kind of polish before joining the Nationals in the December 2016 Danny Espinosa trade. McGowin struggled the following year in the upper Minors but regrouped in the Arizona Fall League, setting up a breakout 2018 campaign in which McGowin reached the Major Leagues for the first time at age 26.  McGowin lacks dominant stuff but knows how to execute a solid three-pitch mix. His fastball sits at 90-92 mph with some sink on account of his three-quarter action. His slider started to snap back into shape during his AFL stint and serves as his go-to secondary pitch, featuring a well-above-average spin rate that gives it wipeout action and induces whiffs. McGowin also throws an average changeup and is consistently around the strike zone with his entire arsenal.  McGowin's resurgence was largely tied to his improved mental approach on the mound, as he showed aggressiveness and confidence that he had struggled to channel in previous seasons.

He's seen time in both center and right field, with an easily plus arm that could help him profile in the corner spot down the road.

He ranked sixth in the Minors with 54 steals during his full-season debut in 2015 but never hit the ball with much authority before slamming 15 homers in 2018 -- one fewer than his total for his first six pro seasons. The Giants acquired him and right-hander Juan DePaula in July, sending Andrew McCutchen to New York.  Avelino has a history of making consistent contact from the right side of the plate and using his plus speed to steal bases. He began pulling and driving the ball more often last season, though he had less success doing so following a promotion to Triple-A. It remains to be seen whether he can provide double-digit home runs on a regular basis, which may be the different between starting and serving as a backup in the big leagues.  A versatile defender, Avelino played shortstop, third base, second base and all three outfield spots in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason. His plus arm grades as his best tool and allows him to make all the throws needed at shortstop, his primary position.

But Davis and the Rangers seemed to be tinkering with his swing since his acquisition and by 2018 instructional league, his stance had closed significantly and Davis had changed the way his hands set up. The drop in his ground ball rate since coming over from LA -- 38% with Texas, after close to 50% with the Dodgers -- seems to corroborate the visual evidence of tweaks, so there's a chance Davis' 2018 was just the product of developmental growing pains.   Even at 21, Davis remains physically projectable and is likely to add more and more mass and strength to his giant frame as he enters his mid-20s. The lift and rotation in his swing appear suited for power production that might arrive in games when new muscle arrives on the body. Davis doesn't track pitches well and he often appears imbalanced at the plate. We have him projected as a strikeout-prone third baseman who sells out for big power. He'll need to improve a bit on defense to stay on the infield, but it's unreasonable to expect most athletes this size to have total control of their bodies at this age anyway, so there's cause for optimism on that end.   We're still on Davis despite a bad 2018, and think he has some dormant thump that will make him relevant eventually.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TEX\"","\"AA\"","29","\"2015 Draft Rnd 5 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"37.3\"","\"46.4\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","45","50","45","55","40","50","55","40","50","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1015","1012","985","903","989","\"41.0\"","\"41.3\"","\"40.0\"","\"46.1\"","\"33.3\"","\"47.2\"","\"|\"","\"Juan\"","\"Querecuto\"","2019","\"18.7\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","230","6","\"|\"","1977","677603","","","\"sa3005721\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","40","","","\"Querecuto suffered a torn meniscus in February, but his physical immaturity almost certainly had him ticketed for the AZL, so while he may be brought along slowly as minor league spring training gets underway, he should be fine for game action during extended spring training, and when rookie ball starts in June.

While his older brother is a 5-foot-8 utility type, Querecuto already stands 6-foot-2, with a lean and lanky frame. His glovework is currently ahead of his bat, partially because of his outstanding defensive skills and partially because of a lack of physicality at the plate. His hands, actions and plus arm all point to a future at shortstop, but a lack of speed and, as a result, range will mean he'll have to use his very high baseball IQ to stick at the premium position, something that is way too early to rule out. He does have a decent approach from the right side of the plate, with a willingness to draw walks.  He will have to add strength in order to have any impact as a hitter.

His first six big league hits were doubles, a record, and then opposing pitchers began to make adjustments, and Tellez cooled, often chasing stuff out of the zone. He's vulnerable to velocity up and was uncharacteristically tempted by soft stuff beneath the zone. He crushes mistakes and has natural low-ball ability, as well as feel for lacing hard gap liners to left field if fastballs away from him catch too much of the plate.

Late in 2018, he was touching 96 and flashing a plus changeup and curveball. A mammoth 6-foot-6, it's possible Oviedo's command will come later as he gains control of his limbs.

Oviedo signed for $1.9 million, the second-highest payday doled out by the organization that year after Jonathan Machado's $2.35 million bonus. The right-hander's United States debut was a bit uneven, and he endured similar struggles early in 2018 at Class A Peoria, posting a 6.47 ERA through his first 10 starts. But Oviedo settled in after that and pitched well the rest of the way, registering a 3.10 ERA and averaging nearly a strikeout per inning over his final 81 1/3 frames.   Oviedo's fastball hasn't quite ticked back up to where it was when he was up to 96-97 mph shortly after signing, but there's plenty there, sitting in the 92-94 mph range and touching a bit higher even as he works deep into starts. His curve and changeup are both developing along with his command, which currently is well below-average. The Cardinals think there's an above-average breaking ball in there with further refinement, while his changeup already flashes above-average and could be a near-plus offering at maturity.   Club officials were impressed with the adjustments Oviedo made halfway into his first full season, praising him for how he remained focused after a shaky April and May. A huge physical specimen at 6-foot-6, the right-hander will continue to work on getting his frame in sync and repeating his delivery, and the belief is that it will lead to more consistent strike-throwing with his three-pitch mix.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","\"AA\"","26","\"2016 J2 (STL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","19","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"40.0\"","\"47.9\"","\"42.5\"","\"|\"","0.5000","0.0000","0.0000","-1.0","-1.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2300","2450","30","50","45","50","45","","","40","55","55","55","50","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","50","","","","","40","","",""],["1019","1016","1010","886","936","\"40.9\"","\"40.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"|\"","\"Marcos\"","\"Gonzalez\"","2019","\"19.6\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2048","672733","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"CLE\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - CLE\"","2022","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  The Indians didn't spend big on the 2016 international market, with Gonzalez receiving the highest bonus they gave to a position player at $250,000.

Gonzalez has good feel for the barrel and making contact, using a compact right-handed swing to stroke line drives to all fields.

Still only 23 for the 2019 season, the six-foot right-hander looks and carries himself like a much more mature and older pitcher. Hernandez has good command of a three-pitch mix that allows him to work fast and efficiently, a defense's dream. He'll show spurts of premium velocity, touching 98 mph on occasion, but usually operating at 91-93 mph, while also using a two-seamer at 89-90 mph. He largely relies on his fastball and above-average changeup, though he utilizes his average curveball effectively.

They were pleased that he was more dedicated to his preparation and aggressive on the mound in 2018, yet he got knocked around for a 4.53 ERA in Triple-A. He made his big league debut in June, allowing one run in four innings in a start against the Dodgers.  Underwood enticed scouts by flashing a 98-mph fastball and a hammer curveball as an amateur, but he hasn't been as overpowering as hoped as a pro. He'll sit at 92-95 mph with modest life and decent control of his heater, while his curveball is more of an average second pitch. He has made strides with his fading changeup and there are games where it's more effective than his curveball.  Underwood is doing a better job of throwing strikes and staying healthy than he did earlier in his career. Though he might be able to help Chicago as a back-of-the-rotation starter, his stuff could be more dynamic in shorter stints if he becomes a reliever.

While he is just 5-foot-11, Garcia still manages to get good downhill plane, and his fearlessness on the mound helps his stuff play up. Thanks to a structured throwing program, he's managed to add 3-4 mph on his fastball since signing and will sit in the low-90s with the ability to reach back for more with his four-seamer on occasion, while his two-seamer has cutting action to it. His breaking ball can be a plus pitch, with late knee-buckling action to it, thrown in the 80-81 mph range. His changeup gives him what should be a solid third option.

He's enjoyed similar success in the professional ranks so far and began to move quickly in '18, ascending three levels to reach Double-A in his first full season.   Villines' fastball is below average from a velocity standpoint, sitting mostly in the upper 80s, but he consistently gets it past hitters thanks to deception created by his low arm slot. That slot gives his effective slider broad sweeping action, while his changeup drops off the table as it approaches the plate. The changeup is the better secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and was instrumental in him holding left-handed hitters to a .167/.254/.294 clip in 2018. He's an adept strike-thrower with all three pitches, demonstrating above-average control and command against hitters on both sides of the plate.   But perhaps what's most intriguing about Villines is that he can induce whiffs with relative ease. Working 66 2/3 innings in his first full season, he struck out 37 percent of the hitters he faced while averaging 13 strikeouts per nine. Villines doesn't fit into a neat box as a big league reliever, but there's something to be said about his sustained dominance, and it would surprise no one in the organization if he continued his accelerated climb toward the Majors in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","","45","","","","55","","",""],["1024","1021","1015","891","876","\"40.9\"","\"40.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","\"Casey\"","\"Golden\"","2019","\"24.7\"","\"OF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3062","668680","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2017, 20th (596) - COL\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 60 | Run: 45 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Golden had a fairly nondescript career at University of North Carolina-Wilmington over his first three years. As a senior, however, he exploded for a school-record 21 homers, enough for the Rockies to take a flier on him in the 20th round of the 2017 Draft. He's kept on hitting the long ball, with 20 during his summer pro debut and an organization-leading 34 during his first full season a year ago.  Though Golden has called hitter-friendly parks home in his pro career, he's shown the ability to hit the ball out of any park. With that power comes a lot of swing and miss, with a strikeout rate of over 34 percent during his first full season. A fringy runner, Golden is aggressive on the basepaths, with his 24 steals in 2018 as evidence of his baserunning acumen. A decent fielder with a solid arm, Golden has seen time at all three outfield spots, but probably profiles best in left should he settle into one spot long-term.  Golden, at 24 years old, is a bit old for his level. If he can manage his strikeouts enough to continue to tap into his considerable power, he could start to move a bit more quickly through the Rockies' system, with the chance to be a run-producing corner outfielder his ceiling, though a career as a fourth outfielder/power bat off the bench is a more likely outcome.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","60","45","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1025","1022","1016","892","877","\"40.9\"","\"40.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","\"Sam\"","\"Coonrod\"","2019","\"26.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","867","656322","\"coonrod_sam\"","","\"sa827483\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SF\"","\"2014, 5th (148) - SF\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 55 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Though he put himself on the prospect map by hitting 98 mph as a Southern Illinois freshman, Coonrod went just 8-17 in three years with the Salukis and lasted five rounds of the 2014 Draft.

Holmes has legitimate top-of-the-scale speed that allows him to beat out routine grounders and wreak havoc on the bases. He's still learning to get the most out of his quickness as a basestealer, in part because his offensive and injury struggles have limited his attempts. He can track down balls from gap to gap in center field, and his fringy arm is playable there.  Holmes showed some feel for the barrel as an amateur, so his inability to make contact early in his pro career has been surprising. Unlike a lot of elite speedsters, he's not a slappy hitter just trying to put the ball in play, as he has a quick right-handed stroke, at least average raw power and a willingness to drive the ball.

The Nats brought him to the U.S. during the fall to participate in the organization's instructional league, and De La Rosa promptly added to his growing reputation by barreling a ball with authority to straightaway center field in what technically was his first stateside at-bat.   Listed at 5-foot-11, 160 pounds, De La Rosa is physically advanced for his age, with a strong, compact frame that has remaining projection. That strength translates to plus bat speed and barrel control as part of an explosive left-handed swing that has led evaluators to project him as a potential above-average hitter with at least average power. In general, he's a confident hitter who repeats his swing better than the average 17-year-old international signee. Defensively, De La Rosa has the above-average speed to play center field, though physical maturation could eventually force him to either right or left field.   The Nationals are among the best in the business in terms of scouting and developing international talent, with 2018 NL Rookie of the Year runner-up Juan Soto and 2019 top prospect Victor Robles serving as recent examples.

He has since made a quick rise through the Minors, jumping straight from Class A West Michigan to Double-A Erie en route to 18 saves in 2018. Schreiber pitched well in his return to the level in '19, earning a promotion to Triple-A in late April.  Starting from a closed setup, Schreiber hides the ball very well on his backside before delivering from a near side-arm slot. His combination of deception and extension gives his fastball, which can reach 92 mph, extra late life that enables him to beat hitters up in the zone. He pairs his heater with a tight slider, and together they make him tough on right-handed hitters. While he's also comfortable throwing it backdoor to lefties, he'll need to develop a more consistent changeup to be successful against lefties at the highest level.

He remains an archtypical right field prospect. There's power, a huge frame, and arm strength. He'd be a sophomore-eligible college player in 2019 had he gone to Oklahoma State and the Pirates typically send newly drafted collegians to the New York-Penn League.

While Mitchell has started to take off, Uselton has had trouble finding any traction. His debut summer ended after a serious hamstring injury, and he struggled to hit in the Rookie-level Appalachian League in 2018.  The 2018 season was meant mostly for Uselton to get his professional legs under him, especially since he completely tore his hamstring the previous summer. It's unclear if there were some lingering effects, but he never could get his right-handed bat going. Uselton is believed to be more power over hit with some strength and leverage to his swing, and the Pirates still hope his power will start to show up the further removed from the injury he is. He'll need to get back to driving the ball to all fields.  Uselton is also a former football player, and that athleticism was a plus for him as he entered pro ball.

He took a nice step forward as a sophomore setup man, then was absolutely dominant during an All-Star Cape Cod League performance, where he didn't give up a run over 12 appearances. He used that as a springboard to become one of the best college closers in the nation and make a run at the school's single-season saves record.  Wallace is the prototypical power short reliever and his stuff will play at the next level. He'll throw both a two-seam and four-seam fastball, the former thrown 92-94 mph with good sink and the latter sitting 95-98 mph consistently. He does have a tendency to rush to the plate, which forces him to get on the side of his slider. Once he learns to stay back consistently and stay on top of the hard breaking ball, it should be a plus out pitch for him.

But after a stellar pro debut in which Klobosits posted a 1.47 ERA with 10.0 strikeouts-per-nine across three levels including Class A Hagerstown, it's clear that the Nationals drafted a better player than even they had expected. A candidate to shoot through the Minors in his first full season, Klobosits instead had his highly anticipated campaign wiped out by Tommy John surgery in May.  An imposing presence on the mound at 6-foot-7, Klobosits has the ability to dominate hitters with his blend of size, stuff and deception. He uses his height to create good angle on a plus fastball that sits in the mid-90s with late life. His slider is his go-to secondary offering, flashing above average, and he also demonstrates feel for throwing a splitter. Klobosits had no problems throwing strikes in his pro debut after pitching with below-average control as an amateur.  Klobosits' strike-throwing ability will be tested at higher levels, however, as will the consistency and quality of his stuff. But if his pro debut is a sign of what's to come, Klobosits, once healthy, could make a quick rise through the Minors en route to a late-inning role in Washington's bullpen.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","","","55","","50","","45","","",""],["1037","1034","1028","872","1087","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","\"Jake\"","\"Woodford\"","2019","\"22.6\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"220\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1304","663765","\"woodford_jake\"","","\"sa874753\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"STL\"","\"2015, CBA (39) - STL\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 40  Woodford was a teammate of Kyle Tucker at Plant High School in Tampa, and they both had their names called on the first day of the 2015 Draft. While Tucker went to the Astros with the No. 5 pick, Woodford remained on the board until the Cardinals took him at No. 39 overall. Making his full-season debut the next year at age 19, Woodford posted a 3.31 ERA for Class A Peoria and then bested it at Class A Advanced Palm Beach in 2017, when he finished sixth in the system in ERA (3.10). And while the results weren't there for Woodford in 2018, he still made strides with his development, logging a career-high 145 innings while splitting his age-21 season between Double- and Triple-A.   Woodford pitches with average velocity, with a four-seamer that tops out at around 94 mph, but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. It leads to a lot of contact but few whiffs, underscoring his smaller margin for error, and his heater can be very hittable when left up in the zone -- something upper-level hitters capitalized on in 2018. His changeup is solid average, and his slider, while inconsistent, might get to Major League average as well.   Scouts noted that Woodford dialed back his aggressiveness in 2018, as he would nibble at the corners too much with his fastball and become very predictable with his sequencing after falling behind in the count. The Cardinals are confident that he'll make the necessary adjustments in his approach to overcome those tendencies, citing his work ethic and competitiveness as reasons to believe the young right-hander eventually will put it all together en route to the Major Leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","24","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","45","","","","50","\"DET\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1038","1035","1029","873","1088","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","\"Jesus\"","\"Castillo\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1563","612792","","","\"sa657701\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","","\"Aug. 27, 2011 - ARI\"","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 40    Castillo begain his career with the D-backs, signing back in August 2011, but was dealt to the Cubs in February '13, before he had even pitched in the United States. He was on the move again at the Trade Deadline in '16, joining the Angels courtesy of the Joe Smith trade, with his new organization sending him to full-season ball for the first time. He broke out in '17, pitching across three levels and reaching Double-A, earning a spot on the 40-man roster as a result. His return to the Southern League did not go as well in 2018, a season that also included close to a month on the disabled list.    With just average stuff across the board, Castillo has to rely on command and generating weak contact to succeed. While he still managed a solid ground-ball rate in 2018, thanks to his 90-91 mph fastball with heavy sink, he missed fewer bats and also saw his walk rate tick up. His secondary stuff, an upper-70s curve and a changeup he is capable of throwing with good arm speed and deception, is average at best. Deception and extension in his delivery have helped him in the past, and he's always been a solid strike-thrower.    Castillo went to the Arizona Fall League to make up for lost innings and it was more of the same, as he gave up more than 13 hits per nine innings.

After he hit just .221/.254/.275 in his first three pro seasons, they converted him to the mound in 2014. He made his big league debut with the Angels last summer after they acquired him and Ty Buttrey in a trade for Ian Kinsler, then went to the Giants organization in a swap for Chris Stratton in March.  Jerez has more arm strength than most left-handers, sitting at 93-97 mph with some sink on his fastball. After struggling against righties early in his career, he has kept them in check by developing an 86-90 mph splitter that was his most effective pitch during his first stint in the Minors. He throws a slider in the same range, though it's more notable for its velocity than its bite.  Jerez took to throwing strikes quickly for a converted position player but his control hasn't been as sharp as he has progressed to the upper levels.

After a strong full-season debut in 2017, he moved up to the Carolina League in '18, when he was sent to the Royals as part of the Kelvin Herrera trade in June.  The speed and athleticism that made Perkins an intriguing Draft prospect are still very much his calling cards. There's some serious basestealing potential, and even though he's swiped 60 in the last two years, the Royals noticed a certain lack of aggressiveness and think there's more to unlock there. His speed pairs well with his plus defensive instincts to make him a lot of fun to watch in the outfield. There's upside in the bat as well. He's already shown a willingness to draw walks; if he can cut down his strikeout rate, he has top-of-the-order potential.

He changed that perception in 2016 with a breakout performance at age 24 in the Florida State League, and then he held his own the following year over a full season in the Double-A Eastern League before a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League. He built upon that success in 2018, earning a mid-season promotion to Triple-A, then became the first Central Arkansas product to reach the Major Leagues since 1991 when he received a September callup.   While undersized, Davis has excellent strength for his size and creates above-average bat speed from the right side. The result is sneaky power to all fields, though he does most of his damage to the pull side. That he finished third in walks in both the FSL and EL in back-to-back years (2016-17) highlights his ability to control the strike zone and work deep counts, although his patient approach does lead to some swing-and-miss. Davis' on-base skills also help him contribute on the basepaths, where his plus speed makes him a threat to steal 15-plus bases annually.  Davis spent much of his time between the outfield corners before shifting to center field in 2017. Though he took quickly to the position and has continued to make strides as a defender in subsequent years, he's probably going to be a better long-term fit in left field on account of his below-average arm strength.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"45.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","60","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1042","1039","1033","877","1037","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"45.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","\"Quinn\"","\"Brodey\"","2019","\"23.5\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2185","656260","\"brodey_quinn\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2017, 3rd (97) - NYM\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Brodey was a two-way prospect in high school, one some teams liked as a left-handed pitcher, and he both pitched and hit in his first year at Stanford. He then focused on being an outfielder, and while his junior season wasn't quite as strong as his All-Star turn in the Cape Cod League the summer prior, the Mets still saw enough to take him in the third round of the 2017 Draft and sign him for a slightly below-pick-value bonus of $500,000. Brodey reached the Florida State League in his first full season, showing power potential but also swing-and-miss issues along the way.   While Brodey doesn't possess any plus tools, he can do a number of things well and has plenty of room for improvement. He has some feel to hit from the left side of the plate, with good raw power that translates to high exit velocities. But with an unselective approach and a willingness to expand his zone, Brodey has struggled to hit for much average or reach base at a reasonable clip so far as a pro. The Mets believe he'll make more consistent contact as his timing improves, and the more he can work counts, the better he will be at reaching that power.   Though he profiles more as a tweener defensively, Brodey has impressed the Mets with how he's handled center field early in his career, showing solid instincts and an average arm.

His breaking ball has bat-missing vertical action and is hard for hitters to differentiate out of Bradish's hand, in part because his delivery causes the ball to suddenly appear out from behind his head, which some hitters struggle to adjust to.

Fernandez is an aggressive hitter with some pop and he drives the ball to all fields. The ball jumps off of his bat now, and he is expected to have even more power in the future. Fernandez is a plus runner -- he's consistently clocked in the 6.4- to 6.5-second range in the 60-yard run -- and he's expected to add strength to an already strong arm.

He should be back on the mound in 2019, but there isn't as much upside as his numbers would suggest, even if everything comes back as it was before. Humphreys works with three pitches that are all average to slightly above to go with similar command, but his control is above average. The upside is as a No. 4 starter and the reasonable expectation is more of a No. 5 starter, spot starter, or long reliever. This is the kind of pitcher who will excel statistically in the lower levels, where hitters generally aren't selective and aren't used to a pitcher who can command three MLB-quality pitches, but that's the expectation in Double-A. Humphreys is another in a long line of a stated Mets draft strategy: low-bonus, later-round high school pitchers (all from Florida in this case) like John Gant, Erik Manoah and Christian James. Saul Gonzalez from the 2018 draft, Bryce Hutchinson from 2017, and a couple others in the 'wait and see' bucket also fit this description.\"","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2015, 18th (539) - NYM\"","","2020","45","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 45  An 18th-round pick in 2015 who signed for $150,000, Humphreys first put himself on the map in '16, when he was among the leaders in the rookie-level Appalachian League in a host of pitching categories. He further raised his profile in his first full season, posting a 10-1 record and 1.42 ERA over 11 starts at Class A Columbia to earn a promotion to the Florida State League. That lasted only two starts, however, as Humphreys was shut down in late June with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in August, costing him all of 2018.  A strong and physical right-hander, Humphreys will impress with his combination of present stuff and plus control when healthy. His fastball will sit in the 90-94 mph range with riding life to it, and he commands it so well that the pitch usually plays above its velocity grade. He has feel for spinning a breaking ball, throwing a curve that will flash above average at times and a slider he'll mix in occasionally, while his changeup, already an effective weapon against lefties, could become his best secondary pitch with more refinement. He's missed plenty of bats and is an extreme strike-thrower, with career rates of 9.4 K/9 and 1.6 BB/9.  With a clean bill of health, Humphreys is expected to begin 2019 on schedule. He'll be 22 for most of the season, underscoring how he has plenty of time to get back on track and reach his ceiling as a No. 4-type starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYM\"","\"A+\"","27","\"2015 Draft Rnd 18 (NYM)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","16","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","50","45","","","","60","\"PIT\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1049","1046","1041","1165","500","\"40.6\"","\"40.6\"","\"39.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"49.3\"","\"|\"","\"Zach\"","\"Watson\"","2019","\"21.9\"","\"CF\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"166\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2440","","\"watson_zach\"","","","\"|\"","","\"LSU\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2022","37","","","\"Like most LSU outfield products, Watson profiles as a bench outfielder with speed and arm strength.

He hasn't shown quite the same power since but has posted identical stat lines in each of his three years of college while impressing with his speed and defense. After dropping to the Red Sox in the 40th round amid signability concerns as a sophomore-eligible, he'll go in the first five rounds this June.    Watson's best pure tool is his well above-average speed. His quickness and instincts allow him to steal bases and chase down balls all over center field, where he has a playable if fringy arm. His defensive ability is reminiscent of that of former LSU star Andrew Stevenson, who has seen big league time with the Nationals.    Watson's offensive game draws more mixed reviews from scouts. He has surprising bat speed and sneaky power for a speedster who's not physically imposing, though he gets caught up swinging for the fences too often.

Chicago signed him for an above-slot $400,000 in the fifth round, then gave him more action at shortstop than at second in his pro debut.   Weber added strength and began trying to drive the ball more often in 2018, making him more of an offensive threat. He still stands out more for his ability to make contact from the left side of the plate than his power, which could produce 12-15 homers on an annual basis. His uncharacteristic 26 percent strikeout rate in his first taste of pro ball may have been the result of fatigue because he fanned at just a 12 percent rate in college.  Weber has fringy speed but plays faster than that on defense. With quick hands and a strong arm, he projects as a solid shortstop or a plus second baseman.

CC to Georgia College, but the Phillies signed him for $50,000 in August 2014 after spotting him in the summer Northwoods League. They traded him to the Diamondbacks as part of an exchange of international bonus slots the following year, and the Red Sox acquired him as the player to be named later for Deven Marrero in May 2018. He has one of the strongest lefty arms in the system, which prompted Boston to protect him on its 40-man roster last November.  Taylor primarily attacks hitters with two pitches, a 94-96 mph four-seam fastball that reaches 98 and a mid-80s slider that grades as plus at its sharpest. He can turn his slider into a harder, cutter-like offering. A starter for his first 2 1/2 pro seasons, he also can mix in a curveball and changeup.  While Taylor has better stuff than a typical southpaw, he doesn't harness it on a consistent basis.

He excelled that summer while playing in the Northwoods collegiate summer league, earning MVP honors and breaking the league record for hits (111), and then built on that performance as a senior by slashing .328/.394/.474. Impressed with McCoy's progress and all-around skills, the Orioles made him their sixth-round pick in 2017. After a solid first full season at Class A Delmarva, McCoy got off to a hot start in 2019 at Class A Advanced Frederick, earning a promotion to Double-A just a month into the season.  McCoy can do a little bit of everything on the field, most notably hit for average while offering plus defense at shortstop. He's fundamentally sound there, showing good range, soft hands and a strong arm, as well as consistency that has long impressed evaluators. At the plate, McCoy offers little in the way of power but has a disciplined approach and good feel for hitting to all fields.  The Orioles liken McCoy's abilities to those of former big league shortstops Walt Weiss and Mike Bordick, players who stood out for their sum of all parts rather than specific tools.

Harris went to Missouri after high school, went undrafted after hitting 12 homers as a junior and then had to wait until the 32nd round to get picked by his hometown team in 2018 after hitting 11 more homers in his senior year. He signed for $10,000 and reached full-season ball in his first summer, then was tearing it up at the start of his first full season.    A bit undersized at 5-foot-10, Harris uses that, and the fact he was overlooked by many teams, as motivation. He's shown more feel to hit as a pro than many expected, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields while keeping a solid walk rate and a low strikeout rate. He's shown surprising over-the-fence pop in 2019, mostly to the pull side. An above-average runner, Harris may not end up being much of a basestealing threat, but he uses his speed well in the outfield, where he's proven to be a very capable defender in both corners.    As a late senior sign, Harris is going to have to prove himself at every level and was a bit old for where he was playing at the start of the 2019 season. The way he was performing, however, should afford him the chance to do just that, and the Braves might have stumbled upon a future fourth or fifth outfielder.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"44.3\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","45","55","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1054","1051","1046","865","1103","\"40.6\"","\"40.6\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"|\"","\"Brock\"","\"Deatherage\"","2019","\"23.7\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3049","656361","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"DET\"","\"2018, 10th (285) - DET\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 70 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  Deatherage hit just .218 as a junior after combining for a .307 average during his first two years at North Carolina State. The Pirates still took him in the 29th round that year, but Deatherage returned to college for his senior year. It proved a smart decision, as he set career highs in home runs (14) and steals (18) as a senior, leading to his selection by the Tigers in the 10th round. After signing for $10,000, Deatherage kicked off his pro debut with a three-homer game in the Gulf Coast League and finished the season at Class A Advanced Lakeland, ultimately slashing .326/.385/.504 with 19 steals across three levels.  While he has good raw power to his pull side, Deatherage projects for below-average game power as he climbs the ladder and faces better pitching. He should hit for some average, though, and he adds value on both sides of the ball with his plus-plus speed. Those wheels give him a chance to stick in center, where he's an above-average defender with good instincts.

It turned out to be his finest offensive season, and the Mariners took him in the fifth round in 2016. While he was a money-saver, Walton did make it to Double-A in his second full season despite missing close to two months of his first full year with a wrist injury.    While not overly toolsy, Walton has outstanding instincts and is very steady on both sides of the ball. A switch-hitter who tends to be better from the left side, Walton has good bat speed with a knack for contact and more pop than you might expect given his size. He makes the most out of his average speed on the basepaths, and he's adept at reading pitchers and taking extra bases.    Walton started out playing more shortstop during his pro career, but his below-average arm has moved him mostly over to the right side of second base, though he can still fill in at short in a pinch.

Thanks to improved eyesight from contact lenses, the 2014 supplemental first-rounder came into his own offensively in '17, showing a more disciplined approach while hitting for power as well as some average while reaching Double-A for the first time. Returning to the Southern League in 2018, Gatewood was having another strong offensive campaign until he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in July.   A right-handed hitter with plus bat speed, Gatewood generates booming contact to all fields with a leveraged swing and huge extension through contact. He's hit for more power in each season as a pro and had already hit a career-high 19 home runs at the time of his knee injury. Gatewood's power will always come with alarming strikeout totals, but he has made huge strides with his approach and plate discipline, chasing fewer pitches and even showing some willingness to take a walk. A shortstop early in his career, Gatewood slid over to third base in 2016 before transitioning to first base the following year.

Such was the case with McGovern, who was coming off a strong senior season in Georgia during which he hit over .300 for the first time and bashed 18 home runs. He was John Wiedenbauer's gut feel guy. The Mariners took him in the ninth round of the 2018 Draft, signed him for $65,000, and he rewarded Wiedenbauer's faith by hitting 15 home runs in the full-season Midwest League in his debut.  It should surprise no one to learn that McGovern's power is his calling card. It's legitimate plus raw power, and it was encouraging to see a solid approach employed to consistently get to it during his debut. Yes, there's swing and miss, but he also worked counts and drew walks. He's going to have to hit with power to advance because it's unclear where he'll play defensively. He's not a runner and he doesn't throw well, with left field or first base perhaps his best shots to find a home.  He can work on his body to become a bit more athletic, but it's possible McGovern ends up as a DH when all is said and done. If he can go out and repeat what he did during his summer debut, how long before people start squinting and seeing a little Paul Goldschmidt, an unheralded eighth-rounder himself back in 2009?\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","30","45","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1058","1055","1050","869","1107","\"40.6\"","\"40.6\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"|\"","\"Niko\"","\"Decolati\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"OF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2542","680719","\"decolati_niko\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2018, 6th (186) - COL\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Over the course of his three years playing for Loyola Marymount, Decolati intrigued scouts by showing flashes of five playable tools. He really stood out in the Cape Cod League in 2017, but when he didn't carry over that performance to his junior year, he ended up being available for the Rockies in the sixth round of the 2018 Draft, where he signed for full pick value. He looked much more like the Cape Cod version of himself during his pro debut, finishing in the top 10 in a host of categories and earning an All-Star nod in the rookie-level Pioneer League.  Primarily a shortstop in college, the Rockies immediately moved him to the outfield and liked what they saw there. He played most of the summer in right field, and has the arm for the spot, but he could have the speed and instincts to be a solid average defender in center field. That speed also helps him on the bases, and he broke out of the gate with 17 steals in his pro debut. Everything else went well for him during his debut, from managing the strike zone and drawing walks to toning down his overly aggressive approach in order to use all fields to hit for average and power. If you saw Decolati on the right day, you might put above-average grades on him across the board.  The Rockies love Decolati's makeup and natural leadership ability. If he can show that his summer debut is for real, he could move up this list, and the Rockies' ladder, in a hurry.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","22","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","50","60","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1059","1056","1051","870","1108","\"40.6\"","\"40.6\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"44.8\"","\"|\"","\"Robert\"","\"Neustrom\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"208\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2516","680438","\"neustrom_robert\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","\"2018, 5th (145) - BAL\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 40  Danan Hughes is best known as a wide receiver who played six seasons in the NFL, but he also was the last Iowa position player selected in the first five rounds (third round to the Brewers in 1992). Neustrom added his name to that very short list in 2018, going to the Orioles in the fifth round after an all-star summer in the Cape Cod League and a strong junior campaign in which he batted .311/.386/.538 with 15 doubles, 11 homers and 36 RBIs in 53 games for the Hawkeyes. After signing, he had a successful pro debut in the New York-Penn League.  Neustrom's most attractive tool is his power potential, the product of strength, solid bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing. There are times when he focuses on using the opposite field, and others when he gets pull-happy and vulnerable on the other half. He makes consistent contact and draws his share of walks.  While Neustrom is slow out of the box, he moves well for his size and has at least average speed once he gets going. He played right field for Iowa and possesses an average arm, though most scouts project him as a left fielder in pro ball. He needs to improve his reads and routes as a defender, but he has the work ethic to get the job done.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"44.8\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","50","50","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1060","1057","1018","1383","218","\"40.6\"","\"40.8\"","\"37.0\"","\"51.4\"","\"44.3\"","\"52.1\"","\"|\"","\"Kenyon\"","\"Yovan\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"215\"","\"draft\"","111","3","\"|\"","1833","","\"yovan_kenyon\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Oregon\"","0","0","","","","37","","\"Low-90's stuff with above average breaking stuff and a chance to start, has had a hand injury that has kept him from making his 2019 debut.\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","815","811","\"LAA\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"44.3\"","\"52.1\"","","\"|\"","0.2500","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","40","45","40","50","55","","","50","50","50","55","60","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1061","1058","1191","1380","875","\"40.5\"","\"39.8\"","\"37.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"45.7\"","\"47.1\"","\"|\"","\"Raffi\"","\"Vizcaino\"","2019","\"23.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"235\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","3262","","","","\"sa736742\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2020","37","","","\"Vizcaino has been hurt for long stretches during the last few years and was moved to the bullpen this spring.

He also showed well in brief summer action with the U.S. collegiate national team and in the Cape Cod League, positioning himself to go in the top two rounds of this year's Draft. But he made just three brief starts for Baylor this spring before having surgery to alleviate thoracic outlet syndrome.  While Bradford doesn't overpower hitters, he keeps them off balance by mixing pitches and locations. His best offering is a sinking changeup that he sells with the same arm speed with which he throws his fastball, which plays above its usual 88-91 mph velocity thanks to run, sink and command. He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of his curveball, which stands out more for its depth than its power.  Bradford has a clean delivery and repeats it very well, allowing him to put his pitches where he wants. He earns high marks for his competitiveness and intelligence.

The Colonial Athletic Association pitcher of the year, he established Pride records for ERA, consecutive innings without an earned run (49 1/3) and strikeouts in a season (108) and career (271). After matching Bryan Verbitsky (Padres, 2013) as the highest Draft pick (third round) in school history and signing for a slightly over-slot $563,240, he pitched well in low Class A in his brief pro debut.  Rooney's fastball plays better than its mediocre 88-93 mph velocity because he creates difficult angle with his 6-foot-5 frame and can spot his heater to both sides of the plate. While most scouting reports rated his low-80s slider ahead of his fading changeup in college, the latter was more effective in his introduction to pro ball and showed signs of becoming a plus pitch. His slider could become a solid offering if he tightens it up.  Pitching in the Cape Cod League in the summer of 2017 taught Rooney that he could compete against quality competition without lighting up radar guns, and he took off once he became more aggressive about challenging hitters. His ability to repeat his sound delivery allows him to command his pitches and he's not afraid to work inside.

But he came down with a flexor strain in his forearm and made just two regular-season appearances, clouding his status. He did some bullpen workouts for teams but was shut down as the Draft approached, increasing the likelihood that he follows through on a commitment to Baylor.  Rigney has one of the best sliders in the Draft, a sharp low-80s breaker that carved Baty up. He works the bottom of the strike zone with a 90-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 and features sink and downhill plane. He's physical yet still projectable, so there could be more velocity in his future.  Though he doesn't need it often as a high schooler, Rigney also shows the makings of at least an average changeup with some fade. There's some effort in his high-three-quarters delivery that he can smooth out, but that hasn't prevented him from throwing strikes.

CC. He hit 23 homers in two years and broke the McCook slugging record twice while using wood bats, then transferred to Western Kentucky for 2019. Still unknown at the start of the season, he has stunned scouts with his power and won the first regular-season triple crown in Conference USA history by hitting .402/.488/.828 with 22 homers and 65 RBI.    Sanford's batting-practice displays are becoming legend and his well above-average raw power ranks among the best in the 2019 Draft. He generates impressive bat speed and packs plenty of strength and leverage in his 6-foot-2, 215-pound frame. There are some concerns about the deep load in his left-handed swing and a tendency to get off balance at times, but the quickness of his stroke and his hand-eye coordination make it work.    In addition to his prodigious power, Sanford also offers plus speed and can flash even faster running times, though he's not a prolific basestealer. A first baseman at McCook, he has handled himself well after moving to right field with the Hilltoppers.

The son of longtime big leaguer Tony Graffanino, AJ swung the bat better as a junior, though he missed a chunk of the 2018 season with a hamstring injury. The Braves took him in the eighth round last June and went above pick value to sign him for $300,000. He responded with a strong pro debut, spent mostly in the full-season South Atlantic League.  Graffanino's calling card is still his defense, and he has the same quick hands as his father, who used to play the infield in the big leagues for parts of 13 seasons. At times, Graffanino makes errors because he tries to speed up too much, something that will change once he trusts that his hands are plenty quick enough for the pro game. He has the range, footwork and arm to play shortstop long-term. He has the chance to be an average hitter with some sneaky pop and the ability to make consistent contact. He has an unorthodox setup at the plate, and he'll likely have to fix an issue with the load on his swing, but it's worked for him so far.   Graffanino was a little worn down by the end of the summer, and he worked hard to add some strength to his frame to prepare him for the rigors of a full season.

After setting career highs in most categories in 2017, he struggled in Double-A last season yet still earned his first big league callup. He homered four times in the final month with San Francisco but also struck out 31 times in 63 at-bats.  Garcia has settled on a pull-heavy approach designed to get the most of out of his solid raw power, the product of his strength and the loft in his right-handed swing. He might hit 15-20 homers per year with regular playing time in the Majors, but his pop comes at a cost. He rolls over more soft grounders to the left side of the infield than he should and his aggressiveness means that he rarely walks.  Somewhat rough behind the plate when he entered pro ball, Garcia has worked hard to improve defensively. He has turned himself into an average receiver while also getting quicker and more accurate with his throws.

His best season did come in 2017, following an MVP turn in the California Collegiate League, and the Rockies selected him in the 8th round of the 2017 Draft. He's hit since joining the organization, hitting for average and power during his debut in the Northwest League and then across two levels of A ball in his first full season.  Though he's not the biggest guy in the world, Boswell has shown an ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate. He is capable of being short to the ball and barrels it up when he makes contact, but he will have to cut down his strikeout rate as he progresses. Boswell settled in defensively as a second baseman at Texas and that's where he played during his debut, but he split time between second and third, where his strong arm works well, during his first full season.   Boswell hasn't played much shortstop, but he could probably play there in a pinch, which could come in handy for a future utility role.

That didn't stop them from aggressively pursuing talent, as they handed out 11 six-figure bonuses of $300,000 or less. They may have gotten a bargain when they were able to ink Blanco, a former Cuban star, for $200,000.  When Blanco made his A's debut in the California League in 2018, it had been nearly two years since he had played competitively in Cuba. At the outset, it was all about his speed, an 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, and defense. But he quickly shook the rust off and showed more offensive acumen than anticipated. There wasn't as much swing and miss as some expected to see and he often showed a solid approach at the plate, with some signs of potential extra-base ability. His physicality and speed could add up to an average hitter.  There's no doubt Blanco's speed is his calling card. It allows him to be aggressive on the basepaths (22 steals in 82 games in his debut) and really go get the ball in the outfield. After his first season was cut short by a hamate injury, it will be interesting to see how quickly he can climb the ladder.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","35","80","45","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1071","1068","1064","842","1165","\"40.5\"","\"40.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"|\"","\"Dominic\"","\"Miroglio\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"203\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2752","641884","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"ARI\"","\"2017, 20th (592) - ARI\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  The D-backs had interest in Miroglio, a catcher at the University of San Francisco, in 2016, but a hand injury that cost him most of the year clouded things a bit. The Rays took a flier on him in the 16th round, but the backstop returned to San Francisco for another year. Arizona didn't miss on him in 2017, nabbing him in the 20th round. Miroglio was sent straight to the Class A Advanced California League for his full-season debut, where he turned in an All-Star performance to earn a promotion to Double-A in August and a trip to the Arizona Fall League.   Defense will always be Miroglio's calling card. He is a very good receiver with outstanding leadership skills and feel for managing a game. His average arm plays up because he has a very quick release, and he's done a nice job controlling the running game as a pro, throwing out better than 34 percent of attempted basestealers through two seasons.   Miroglio's development at the plate has been a pleasant surprise for the organization, as he's shown good feel for the strike zone and an ability to consistently barrel the baseball. It's a hit-over-power offensive profile, though he does have good pop to the gaps during games. While Miroglio shows all the ingredients to be a backup catcher in the big leagues, the start of his pro career has some inside the organization thinking he might develop into an everyday player.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","25","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","40","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1072","1069","1065","843","1166","\"40.5\"","\"40.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jacob\"","\"Heyward\"","2019","\"23.8\"","\"OF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3076","641689","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SF\"","\"2016, 18th (545) - SF\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Heyward had the opportunity to play in the same organization as his older brother Jason when the Braves made him a 38th-round pick out of high school in 2013, but he opted instead to attend college at Miami.

He has improved steadily in three years of full-season ball, posting the best numbers of his pro career this year in Double-A.  While Heyward lacks a plus tool, he can do a little of everything and could earn average grades across the board if the offensive improvement he has displayed in 2019 is for real. A right-handed hitter who shows most of his power to his pull side, he's doing a better job of turning on pitches and driving them in the air. He has a patient approach at the plate, though his willingness to work deep counts also results in strikeouts.  Heyward has average speed and can steal an occasional base.

His full-season debut a year later was OK, but he wasn't able to replicate it in 2017 with a move up to Lakeland, where his .220/.246/.292 line left some evaluators scratching their heads. He got back on track in 2018, hitting well in the Midwest League before a return to Lakeland in June.   After the start to his career here in the States, the Tigers thought Azocar would have gained more traction by now. The key culprit has been a lack of any kind of approach at the plate. There's a lot of swing and miss because he chases pitches out of the zone, and he's now walked exactly 14 times in back-to-back years. When he does make contact, it can be loud, and there is some raw power for him to tap into if he can find a way to stop getting himself out. An above-average runner, Azocar has shown he can play center and has a plus arm that looks very good in right.  The Tigers still believe in Azocar's tools.

It has produced a dozen draftees, with Dean one of two Bears to get selected in 2018. An All-Conference performer who hit close to .400 as a junior, the speedy Dean played his way to full-season Rome during his pro debut last summer and opened the 2019 season back in the South Atlantic League.    Dean's speed is clearly his carrying tool. It's close to top of the scale, with some evaluators putting an 80 on it. He's already shown the ability to use it well on the basepaths and should continue to be a serious basestealing threat. That, combined with his solid plate discipline, has worked well in the leadoff spot at the outset of his pro career. While he's never going to be a big home run threat, there is some raw pop to tap into and he consistently shows the ability to barrel up the baseball from the right side of the plate. He has a fringy arm, but it's enough for center field, where his speed gives him the chance to stay long term.    At 5-foot-8, Dean is accustomed to proving doubters wrong.

The Tigers nabbed him in the fourth round of the 2018 Draft and gave him a well above pick value bonus of $900,000 to sign him away from his University of San Diego commitment.  Long and lanky, Liniak has some serious raw tools to grow into. He will need to add strength to his frame to help his bat come along, which will be a bit of a project, and not everyone loves his setup at the plate. There is bat speed and raw power to tap into and his 6-foot-2 frame should be able to handle good weight. His plus speed helps him on both sides of the ball and he runs even better once underway, which allows him to cover a ton of ground in the outfield. He has a strong arm to boot, one which would work from a corner, but he has the tools to stick in center field.  Patience will be the key for the Tigers' player development staff as it will take time for Liniak's raw tools to turn into consistent production.

But Ramos, a 16th-round pick out of College of the Canyons, a two-year school in California, kept on finding the seats after getting promoted to the Eastern League in 2018, making him a much more credible power-hitting prospect.  Ramos finished the year with 32 homers, good for second in the organization, and 15 of those came in Double-A, which is much less hitting-friendly. He has the classic left-handed uppercut swing and easily has raw plus power. He's made some solid adjustments at the plate that allowed him to get to that power much more consistently in 2018, though he is still prone to the strikeout and gets pull-happy at times. He does draw some walks and has shown some aptitude to improving as an all-around hitter.

He threw well enough to land in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft and while he didn't pitch much in his first summer, he did reach full-season ball, though he was too fatigued to throw at instructs.  Big and strong, Feigl has an interesting three-pitch mix to work with, starting with a fastball that touched the mid-90s in his final college season, but sat more at 91-92 over the summer. It has a high spin rate and he can miss bats with it, though he also can keep it down in the zone with sink to elicit ground-ball outs. Both his slider and his changeup flash above-average at times, with his slider the more consistent of the two secondary offerings.   Feigl has always been a strike-thrower, but didn't always command the ball well within the zone, leading to a higher hit rate in college than you'd expect given his stuff.

Intrigued by Tetreault's present ability and remaining projection, the Nationals signed him for $300,000 after selecting him in the seventh round. Working exclusively as a starter in his first full season, Tetreault exhibited a blend of stuff, pitchability and durability en route to a late promotion to Class A Advanced Potomac.   A 6-foot-5 right-hander, Tetreault has a clean delivery and fast arm help him generate a fastball that reaches the mid-90s but typically sits a few ticks lower. He has feel for spinning a curveball that can flash above-average at its best, and he's made strides developing a changeup that's at least average, with room for improvement. Meanwhile, after facing questions about his control and command heading into the season, Tetreault did his part to assuage those concerns by trimming his walk rate from 3.8 to 2.8 BB/9, all while missing a healthy number of bats.   Tetreault impressed Nats officials with his steady, season-long development in 2018. Specifically, they like how he learned to command his fastball to different parts of the strike zone as the season progressed -- he had elevated it too often and was hit around early in the year -- and how the right-hander effectively mixed in his secondary pitches.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","50","","","","","45","","",""],["1079","1076","1072","850","1144","\"40.5\"","\"40.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","\"Jeff\"","\"Brigham\"","2019","\"27.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1510","656257","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"MIA\"","\"2014, 4th (124) - LAD\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Brigham missed his junior season at Washington in 2013 following Tommy John surgery but rebounded to pitch his way into a fourth-round selection by the Dodgers the next June.

Brigham overcame shoulder and oblique injuries that sidelined him for parts of 2017 and '18 to make his big league debut last September.  Brigham earned his promotion to Miami by showing a consistent 94-96 mph fastball throughout the Minor League season, though his velocity dipped to 90-92 once he made it to the Majors. His slider has improved in recent years and often provides him with a solid second offering. He'll need to improve his changeup and use it more often to last in a big league rotation.  The Marlins gave Brigham four starts in September, but his future may actually be in the bullpen.

Beasley relies heavily on a fastball-splitter-changeup trio to get hitters out. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s with occasional life.

A late-blooming Dominican who had first been eligible to sign in August 2012, he has thrived throughout the Minors with the exception of struggling in Class A Advanced last season.    Martinez has a quick arm than unleashes fastballs that sit at 94-97 mph and reaches 99 mph with some riding action. He can flash some plus sliders in the low 80s but lacks consistency with his breaking ball, which flattens out when he doesn't stay on top of it. Similarly, his mid-80s splitter can be solid pitch that drops off at the plate but is also mediocre at times.    Scouts don't love Martinez's three-quarters delivery, which features a long arm action with a lot of effort and some recoil.

The progress has been slow, as Swanda has compiled a grand total of just under 40 innings heading into the 2019 season.    A former shortstop, Swanda is athletic on the mound with a sound and repeatable delivery. His fastball sits around the 90-91 mph range now with decent sink to it, and while there hasn't been the uptick in velocity some hoped to see, the right-hander continues to work on adding strength to his 6-foot-2 frame, so it still could come. He's shown the ability to spin a solid breaking ball and his changeup continues to be a work in progress, though he's shown some feel for it.

San Diego converted him to the mound in mid-2016 and brought him to the Majors for an emergency appearance 13 months later, only to lose him on waivers to the White Sox in December 2017. Chicago outrighted him off its 40-man roster last March but added him again when they made him a September callup.  Ruiz's strong arm threw out 37 percent of basestealers during his days as a catcher and now generates 94-97 mph fastballs that reach 99. He compensates for his relatively short frame by creating a downward angle with a high-three-quarters delivery. He backs up his heater with an 84-88 mph slider that stands out more for its power than its bite.  Ruiz will mix in an occasional changeup but mostly attacks hitters with his fastball and slider. While he throws with effort and never will be able to pinpoint his pitches, he did improve his control and command from his first full season as a pitcher to his second.

He spent the next two seasons in the short-season New York-Penn League, ranking second in opponent average (.191) in 2017 and fashioning a 13 2/3-inning hitless streak last summer. After the Giants acquired him with Abiatal Avelino in a trade for Andrew McCutchen in August, he made his full-season debut by striking out nine in five innings in low Class A. That would be the extent of his Giants career, though, as the club sent him with Alen Hanson and Derek Law to the Blue Jays for Kevin Pillar in April.   De Paula is still in the early stages of his development, succeeding mainly thanks to his fastball. He has added velocity as he has gotten stronger, with his heater rising from the upper 80s when he entered pro ball to now ranging from 92-97 mph, and his 6-foot-3 frame still has room for more muscle. He uses his size and high-three-quarters delivery to throw on a steep downhill plane, making it tough for hitters to lift his fastball.  While he has the potential for a solid three-pitch repertoire, De Paula lacks consistency with his curveball and changeup, with the latter a bit more reliable. His control is also a work in progress, though he does a nice job of working the bottom of the strike zone with his heater. He has a ceiling as a No. 4 starter if he makes the necessary improvements and also could develop into a fastball-heavy reliever.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","50","50","","","","","45","","",""],["1085","1082","1078","856","1150","\"40.5\"","\"40.5\"","\"40.0\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","\"Mike\"","\"Nikorak\"","2019","\"22.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"240\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1262","663841","\"nikorak_mike\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2015, 1st (27) - COL\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Nikorak was raw with an enormously high ceiling when the Rockies took him from the Pennsylvania high school ranks at the end of the first round in the 2015 Draft. After a bit of a rocky debut in the Pioneer League, he went back there in 2016 and took a step forward. It looked like it was carrying over as he was throwing very well in Spring Training in 2017 when he tore the UCL in his elbow and needed Tommy John surgery. He returned to the mound in August 2018 to get a few Pioneer League innings in.  Needing elbow surgery is never a good thing, but there can be benefits from it. For Nikorak, it gave him the chance to reset and focus on his delivery and now that he's healthy, he's ready to put the work he's done in being on time, in repeating his arm slot and in getting the ball down in the zone with his premium velocity. He was in the low-90s with his two-seamer, thrown with sink, while he was up to 97-98 mph with his four-seamer the Spring Training before he got hurt. His curve can be nasty, a low-80s hammer, and he has good feel for a changeup.  As he gets more development time, his ability to repeat his delivery could get him to average control.

Sure enough, he was in the big leagues in 2015, but then missed nearly all of 2016 following Tommy John surgery. He was designated for assignment, then re-signed by the Yankees, and he then went and pitched his way back onto the 40-man roster in 2017 before getting sent to the Mariners in a Minor League deal. His first year in the system was interrupted by injury, but he did make it back up to the big leagues last June.  At his best, Rumbelow relies on his fastball-breaking ball combination. He's always been aggressive on the mound, dating back from his LSU days, and he's still learning how to do that at the highest level. His fastball will touch 96 mph thrown with good deception thanks to an unorthodox delivery. His breaking ball is an above-average power curve with good depth that misses bats. Rumbelow does have an above-average changeup, but he has had trouble getting to it enough for it to be effective.  Some of that has been because of fastball command, especially when Rumbelow's been in the big leagues and hitters haven't chased his stuff out of the strike zone.

He's done just that as he's moved methodically up the organizational ladder, making it to Double-A at the end of 2017 and reaching the Major Leagues for the first time in 2018.   Baez's fastball has improved over time and now will sit in the 95-96 mph range and occasionally touch the upper-90s. His best secondary pitch is now his \"fosh\" changeup, a hybrid between a split-finger and straight change. It's at least Major League average and the bottom drops out of it when he throws it right. His slider has come and gone, with it looking like an average breaking ball one night, and a below-average one the next.   The Tigers moved Baez to the bullpen in July while he was pitching in Double-A.

In junior college, Myatt relied heavily on his fastball, which parks in the mid-90s and peaks at 99 with some riding life. His 6-foot-7 frame gives him extension that adds deception and late finish to his heater. He also has power and some depth to his curveball, which has shown more consistency since he turned pro.  Myatt's changeup has a bit of fade and also has started to improve as he has used it more often in pro ball.

Logan Junior College and then on to Kentucky for his junior year in 2018. He showed glimpses of premium stuff in both starting and relief roles, but put up ugly numbers overall. The Royals took a chance on the power repertoire in the sixth round of the Draft and Haake has responded by being one of the biggest surprises of the class, though some minor shoulder soreness did shelve him for a time during his first full season.    The 6-foot-4 right-hander has always shown a ton with his fastball and he's been regularly up to 97 mph in all of his starts. His changeup has been his best secondary offering so far, a pitch with late splitter-like actions that has depth and he throws with deception at any point in the count. One of the biggest reasons for his step forward is how well he's commanded both his fastball and changeup. His slider is his third pitch, and while he'll occasionally shown a plus one, it's been inconsistent.    When Haake was preparing to enter pro ball, many thought he was destined to land in the bullpen.

He has fine hand-eye coordination and a disciplined, balanced approach that allow him to make repeated contact to all fields. He has quickness in his left-handed stroke and strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame, giving him solid raw power that he taps into without selling out for home runs.  Most of Packard's value will come from his bat, but that could be considerable value as he has the upside of a .280 hitter with 20 homers on an annual basis.

He clocked a 6.21-second 60-yard dash at a Prospect Development Pipeline event last June and wreaked havoc on the bases at the East Coast Pro showcase in August. He has almost no history against quality pitching and faces weak prep competition, so scouts aren't sure what to make of his bat, but he has enough promise that he could go as early as the third round.    Unlike Hamilton, Beard shows the potential to make some impact at the plate. He has a quick right-handed swing and strength in his hands, and he flashes the ability to backspin balls. He'll have to prove he can manage the strike zone and handle breaking pitches, but he has the upside of at least an average hitter with double-digit home run power.    Beard's quickness allows him to beat out routine grounders, steal bases and cover plenty of ground in center field. The Meridian (Miss.)

We have Schaller projected as a reliever but it makes sense to run him out as a starter as a way of developing his milquetoast slider and below-average changeup, as he'll be throwing 25 or 30 innings every month instead of the 12 to 15 innings he'd get coming out of the bullpen.

He missed all of his first year with the Commodores following Tommy John surgery and worked just 24 2/3 innings during the regular season in 2018, albeit while hitting 98 mph with his fastball as a rare Draft-eligible redshirt freshman. That velocity along with Schaller's lack of mileage on the mound intrigued the Nationals, who selected him with their third-round pick last June.  Schaller will pitch at 95-98 mph in short bursts, generating easy velocity with a fast arm. He'll occasionally throw some sharp mid-80s sliders, but for the most part his breaking ball is average right now, with the potential to develop into a more consistent swing-and-miss pitch. He has used his changeup so infrequently that it's best described as a work in progress.  The Nationals again will deploy Schaller as a starter in 2019, viewing it as a good opportunity for him to develop his secondary offerings and refine his control.

While in high school, the infielder came in at around 285 pounds and realized he wasn't in shape for Division I baseball despite an offer from Cal State Northridge. After two years at L.A. Pierce College, a two-year school, Lewis moved to UC-Irvine and weighed in at 215 lbs. He's put up some serious numbers in a pitching-friendly park to put himself firmly on the Draft map.  There's little doubt that it will be Lewis' bat that will carry him as a professional, and he has the chance to hit for power and average. The ball does not travel in his home park, but he was flirting with the school's single-season home run record as the Draft approached. There is some length to his swing, and it can get grooved at times, which can be exposed, but scouts think he has the chance to hit enough to tap into his enormous raw power at the next level. He's a better athlete than he appears to be and has the hands to stay at third, though there's some concern his fringy arm won't work from the hot corner long term.

High has produced Ben McDonald, Russ Johnson and Travis Swaggerty, all of whom blossomed into first-round picks after attending college. The Yellow Jackets' latest star is Doughty, who could follow the same path if he makes it to Louisiana State. How much teams buy into his power potential will determine if he goes high enough in the 2019 Draft to divert him from Baton Rouge.    Doughty is an advanced hitter for a high schooler, showing nice feel for the barrel while employing a compact, quick right-handed swing. He has a controlled approach that mainly produces line drives but he also has room to add 20 pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-1 frame. Though Gatorade's 2019 Louisiana high school player of the year presently has below-average pop, he could develop into a 20-homer threat if he gets stronger and more aggressive.    Doughty can generate some plus run times but figures to lose a step as he matures physically. His quick hands and plus arm allow him to make plays at shortstop, though he probably will wind up at second or third base as he slows down a bit. Adding more power would help him profile better at a less challenging defensive position.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","702","1162","\"DET\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"48.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","55","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1095","1092","1093","827","1199","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"|\"","\"Brian\"","\"Mundell\"","2019","\"25.3\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"230\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1889","621521","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"COL\"","\"2015, 7th (197) - COL\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 30 | Arm: 40 | Field: 45 | Overall: 40  For the first two-plus years of Mundell's pro career, it looked as if the Rockies had gotten a huge steal by taking him in the seventh round of the 2015 Draft out of Cal Poly as he used an advanced approach to hit his way to Double-A by the second half of 2017. A return to that level in 2018 didn't go as well and the Rockies did not protect him from the Rule 5 Draft, but he went unselected.  Mundell's swing got out of whack in 2018 and it took him most of the year to get back on track. Even when he wasn't driving the ball like he had in the past, he was still managing the strike zone, limiting strikeouts and drawing walks and he still has a career .369 on-base percentage entering the 2019 season. When he's on time with his swing, he can hit to all fields, driving the gaps well, though most of his home run power has come to the pull side. There could be more over-the-fence pop as he gets more reps and gets back in a groove.  A DH for most of his college career, Mundell has worked extremely hard at his defense. There's still work to do, but he should be an adequate defender at first base, where the hope is he'll prove once again he has the bat to profile at the infield corner.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","29","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","30","40","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1096","1093","1094","828","1200","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"|\"","\"Caleb\"","\"Frare\"","2019","\"25.9\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"210\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2797","621350","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"CWS\"","\"2012, 11th (367) - NYY\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  When the White Sox called Frare up last September, he joined Les Rohr (the No. 2 overall pick in 1965) as the only pitchers ever drafted out of a Montana high school to reach the big leagues. Signed for $100,000 by the Yankees as an 11th-rounder in 2012, he blew out his elbow and missed the next two seasons following Tommy John surgery. New York traded him to Chicago for $1.5 million in international bonus pool money last July.  There's nothing subtle about Frare, who goes after hitters with a pair of power pitches. His four-seam fastball sits at 92-96 mph and peaks at 98 with riding life up in the strike zone. His slider/cutter also grades as a plus offering, arriving at 87-91 mph with some tilt.  Left-handers managed just one extra-base hit in 90 at-bats against Frare in 2018, and he's also effective against right-handers. The key for him to finding a niche in the White Sox bullpen will be developing reliable control and command.

He didn't catch regularly for his high school team and took several years to become an acceptable defender behind the plate. His stock began to rise when he won MVP honors in the Double-A Eastern League playoffs in 2016, and he totaled 47 homers in the upper Minors the next two years before making his big league debut last September.  Haase has an all-or-nothing approach at the plate. He's going to swing and miss and he rarely walks, but the loft and strength in his right-handed swing give him tremendous power when he connects. Like most catchers, he offers little value on the bases.  Haase has made himself into a decent receiver and scores well in Cleveland's framing metrics. He also has improved the quickness and accuracy of his throws, leading the Triple-A International League by throwing out 49 percent of basestealers in 2018.

He put himself on the map in his first full season, totaling 41 extra-base hits between Hagerstown and Class A Advanced Potomac, then showed improved hitting ability in 2018 while spending the second half in Double-A. He was named the organization's \"Bob Boone\" Award winner after the season and boosted his stock even more during a strong turn in the Arizona Fall League. Noll's bat and defensive versatility on the infield ultimately earned him a spot on the Nationals' Opening Day roster, and he recorded a walk-off walk in his third career plate appearance.   A sum-of-all-parts player without a standout tool, Noll can do a little bit of everything to help a team win. He makes consistent contact from the right side, hitting line drives across the field. He does have some pop, and produced double-digit homers in two straight seasons, but he's more likely to split gaps than clear fences as a big leaguer. Noll runs surprisingly well and has been known to post above-average home-to-first run times out of the box.   After primarily playing second base during his first two seasons, Noll was shifted to the hot corner in 2018 and held his own there, showing reliable hands and a strong arm. He's also seen time at first base, and the Nationals believe he could handle left field if needed. While it's not the profile of an everyday player, Noll does enough things well to warrant a bench spot at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","27","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","50","55","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1099","1096","1097","831","1203","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"43.0\"","\"|\"","\"Pedro\"","\"Castellanos\"","2019","\"21.5\"","\"1B/OF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2301","665776","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","","\"July 2, 2015 - BOS\"","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 30 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 40  Castellanos has been one of the most consistent hitters in the Red Sox system since signing for $5,000 out of Venezuela in 2015. He hit .326 and led the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League with 23 doubles in his 2016 pro debut, then posted a .339 average and missed out on the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League batting title by .001 as an encore. His .302 average would have ranked second in the low Class A South Atlantic League last season if he hadn't been a few plate appearances short of qualifying, and he went on a .330 tear in the second half after recovering from a back injury that cost him six weeks.  Castellanos makes contact with ease while concentrating on drilling line drives from gap to gap. He has good leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame and shows power in batting practice, though he has yet to do so often in games because his right-handed stroke is fairly flat. He'd fit the offensive profile at first base better if he worked deeper counts and drove the ball more often, as his pure hitting ability is obvious.  Though Castellanos lacks speed, he's a decent athlete. He's a fringy defender at first base yet has enough range and arm strength that he also has seen action on both outfield corners during the last two seasons.

He passed on signing with the Cubs as a 37th-round pick and honored his commitment to San Diego, where his defense drew mixed reviews from scouts, but his bat did not. An All-Star turn in the Cape Cod League, followed by a powerful junior campaign earned him a third-round selection by the Blue Jays in 2017, and he continued to impress during his pro debut in the Class A Short Season Northwest League. Adams struggled in 2018 following an assignment straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League, but he fared better during his return to the level early in 2019.  Adams has shown some ability at the plate and increased his power output in each of his three years as a starter at San Diego. He's a physical specimen, possessing both size and strength that leads the Blue Jays to believe he'll eventually tap into more raw power in the pro ranks. Improving his setup at the plate should help in that regard, and he's made a concerted effort to better use the entire field after employing a more pull-heavy approach in college. There is some swing-and-miss to his game, but he also works deep at-bats and draws his share of walks, leading to solid on-base rates.   Adams earns high praise from club officials for his all-around defensive skills and his feel for controlling a game and managing pitchers. His arm strength is only average, but strong catch-and-throw skills enable him to limit the running game, as evidenced by his 45.7 percent caught-stealing rate in his first full season. Those defensive chops could make Adams a backup catcher at the highest level, and any additional progress at the plate could thrust him into consideration for an everyday role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","45","30","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1101","1098","1099","833","1188","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","\"David\"","\"McKay\"","2019","\"24.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2742","641853","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2016, 14th (433) - KC\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 40 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  McKay spent his sophomore season at Florida Atlantic in the bullpen, then moved into the rotation as a junior, pitching well enough to be drafted by the Royals in the 14th round of the 2016 Draft.After a year-plus of predominantly starting, McKay was sent to the Mariners in March 2018. He moved to the bullpen and spent most of the season pitching effectively in Double-A.   The Mariners liked McKay's ability to locate his fastball and his power slider, which is why they thought he would work well in shorter relief roles. He'll sit 93-94 mph with his fastball, but he can pop 95-96 mph on occasion. His plus slider has late break to it and is tough to pick up as it looks just like his fastball coming out of his hand. He has a changeup, but it's well behind the other two as a viable weapon.  What kind of success McKay will have at the upper levels will largely depend on how well he can land his slider in the strike zone with his super aggressive delivery. He reminds some of former big league closer Mike Williams in his ability to get hitters to chase the pitch, but he'll have to throw it more consistently in the zone to get big league hitters out.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","24","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","40","","60","","","","45","","",""],["1102","1099","1100","834","1189","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","\"Jhordany\"","\"Mezquita\"","2019","\"21.3\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3008","674245","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"PHI\"","","\"June 14, 2017 - PHI\"","2022","40","\"Scouting Grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  It was a pick that caused many to scratch their heads on Day 2 of the 2017 Draft. The Phillies selected Mezquita, a left-handed pitcher without a school from Hazelton, Pa. The organization was set to sign him as an international free agent from the Dominican Republic, but he was forced to enter the Draft because he had moved to Hazelton to go to high school. So Philadelphia took him in the eighth round instead, and watched him dominate in the Gulf Coast League. He wasn't bad when he moved up to the short-season New York-Penn League, but he was a bit more inconsistent.  Mezquita was limited in 2018 somewhat by some minor injuries, so the hope is a fully healthy version of the left-hander will be ready to take on full-season ball in 2019. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, there is some arm strength and a feel for pitching that should help him along the way. His fastball will sit in the 91-92 mph range, but he can reach back for 94 mph on occasion. He can spin a breaking ball and has feel for his changeup with the chance to have three average or better offerings when all is said and done. He should be able to throw strikes, though his walk rate spiked a bit in 2018.  The 21-year-old is still playing catch-up in terms of time on the mound, so getting a full season of innings will be important. There's still some upside here, with the ceiling of a No. 4 or 5 starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","50","","","","","45","","",""],["1103","1100","1101","835","1190","\"40.4\"","\"40.4\"","\"40.0\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","\"Nolan\"","\"Hoffman\"","2019","\"21.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","2743","676510","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SEA\"","\"2018, 5th (148) - SEA\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 40  Hoffman spent two years starting at Hutchinson Community College, but he didn't jump onto the radar until he transferred to Texas A&M and served as a multi-inning reliever, one who racked up 14 saves as a junior in 2018 and tied the single-season record at the school. The Mariners liked what they saw enough to take him in the fifth round, and he performed well in brief looks across two levels of rookie ball.  Like fellow M's prospect Wyatt Mills, Hoffman utilizes a low three-quarters arm slot to great effect. Based on velocity, Hoffman's fastball is average, but it does play up at times because of the deception in his delivery. He can miss bats and get ground-ball outs with that and his slider, which flashes plus with good action and depth. There's some concern about his ability to get left-handed hitters out, but when he sequences his pitches well, his changeup does help neutralize them. He's generally around the strike zone with all of his pitches.  Hoffman didn't pitch much over the summer after heavy usage during his junior season.

The shortstop got $1.5 million to sign and has consistently impressed with his defense, and while his offense has struggled to keep up, he showed signs of improvement in 2018, reaching full-season ball for the first time.  There's no question it's Guzman's glove that will carry him up the ladder. He's capable of making spectacular plays at shortstop with an arm that sometimes plays as plus. He has outstanding range, showing he can make the play up the middle or to his backhand side. The organization still believes in his bat from the left side of the plate and thinks he's starting to figure things out. He has had a tendency to get out of his swing, jumping around the box, so the Royals have worked with him to calm things down and give him a more solid base with positive effects. He's also running better than he has in the past, adding speed and being more aggressive on the basepaths.  Guzman has the tools to play shortstop defensively without question.

JC and pushed him up to the Class A South Atlantic League the next year for his first full season. Assigned to Class A Advanced Salem in 2018, he was enjoying a breakout year at the plate in the Carolina League -- one that earned him midseason All-Star honors -- when the Red Sox traded him to Toronto in late June in exchange for Steve Pearce. He received his first Double-A promotion shortly thereafter and returned to the level to begin 2019.  Espinal has a collection of mostly average-or-better tools despite being somewhat undersized. He has good bat speed from the right side of the plate that enables him to make plenty of hard, line-drive contact across the entire field. He's grown into some power since entering the pro ranks, showing some occasional over-the-fence pop, though he's likely to tally more doubles and triples at the highest level. Espinal's above-average speed and quick feet are assets on the basepaths, and together they give him the potential to post double-digit steals in a given season.  Espinal's defense is a separator. His athleticism is on display at shortstop, where he has above-average range, soft hands and the above-average arm needed to stick at the position. He's also seen time at both second and third base, and it's led some evaluators to peg him as a future utility infielder in the big leagues.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","29","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","35","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1106","1103","1017","1379","186","\"40.4\"","\"40.8\"","\"37.0\"","\"51.9\"","\"43.2\"","\"52.7\"","\"|\"","\"Lewin\"","\"Diaz\"","2019","\"22.5\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"76\"","\"225\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","30","650331","","","\"sa828420\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","37","\"b6BzJGKnQbI\"","","\"Diaz didn't perform in his first try at the Florida State League, reaching base at just a .255 clip before his season ended with a thumb fracture, which required surgery.

But too often, Diaz swings at whatever he's offered, limiting the quality of his contact and his ability to reach base. At first base, that might be a problem. Scouts have mixed opinions about his body and how it projects into his mid-to-late-20s, which is when Diaz will likely be on the 40-man fringe, perhaps a fit for some clubs in need of, or with room for, a big-bodied masher on their 40-man.

The Brewers, however, took a gamble on him in the 12th round in June, then surprised many in the industry by signing him for $475,000. After performing well that summer during his pro debut, Ward made noticeable strides in the Pioneer League in 2018.   Ward has plus speed and posts plus home-to-first run times from the left-handed batter's box. His speed also makes him a threat on the bases, and it gives him above-average range in the outfield. At the plate, Ward's left-handed swing yields hard contact and he'll flash power potential. Right now, however, the majority of his contact is on the ground, as his 69.9 percent ground-ball rate in 2018 was third-highest in the Minors among qualified hitters. Of course, that in turn highlights just how much Ward stands to improve in the coming years, with the final product being a player who hits for average and power.   With enough arm and instincts, Ward has the chance to stay in center long-term, unless he fills out his 6-foot-5 frame too much, in which case he could fit a corner outfield profile. While opinions of Ward varied, there are some who feel he's the type of player who could continue to surpass projections.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"MIL\"","\"A\"","38","\"2017 Draft Rnd 12 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","60","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1109","1106","1108","1139","932","\"40.3\"","\"40.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"|\"","\"John\"","\"Rave\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"CF\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"185\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2908","","\"rave_john\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Illinois State\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"Plus runner with a long swing.

The next in line is Rave, a 35th-round pick by the Red Sox out of an Illinois high school three years ago. He's an up-the-middle player who can do a little bit of everything and should go in the same territory as Miller and DeJong.  A left-handed hitter, Rave employed a more contact-oriented mentality in his first two college seasons. He began driving the ball more often and had success doing so with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer, and he has tried to hit for more power this spring. With his current approach, he projects as a possible .270 hitter with 15 homers per season as a pro.  Rave's best tool is his speed, and he'll flash some plus-plus times but play more as a plus runner. He's still learning as a basestealer and shows just average instincts in center field, so he's not getting as much out of his quickness as he can. He has a fringy arm and it's not out of the question that he could wind up in left field and develop into a Brett Gardner type.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"KCR\"","","33","\"2019 Draft Rnd 5 (KCR)\"","\"|\"","900","139","\"KCR\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"46.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","60","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1110","1107","1109","1140","933","\"40.3\"","\"40.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"46.6\"","\"|\"","\"Matt\"","\"Gorski\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"76\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","293","8","\"|\"","2907","","\"gorski_matt\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Indiana\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"Gorski is an above average runner underway with a long, projectable frame and future plus power but limited track record of performance.\"","\"|\"","\"Indiana\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-matt-gorski-of?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45    Owner of one of the best toolsets in college baseball, Gorski should be the highest-drafted University of Indiana position player since Kyle Schwarber (first round) and Sam Travis (second) in 2014. He had a chance to go close to Travis territory after a strong sophomore season, though his stock took a hit when he struggled to make quality contact with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer. He helped Indiana win the Big Ten Conference regular-season title this spring but averaged more than a strikeout per game, so questions about his bat persist.    Gorski has a big league body at 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds, and his strength, leverage and bat speed give him plus raw power. But he has sold out for home runs as a junior, and scouts worry about the length of his right-handed swing, his pull-heavy mentality and his lack of pitch recognition. He still could do a lot of damage while making more consistent contact if he employed a more disciplined approach.    If he hits, Gorski could be a star.

He spent the first half of 2019 as a DH while battling back problems, then returned to the field and played flawless defense in 23 regular-season contests.  Using a compact left-handed swing and a controlled approach, Massey drills line drives from gap to gap. He has exceptional hand-eye coordination and manages the strike zone extremely well, and he continued to provide steady production with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer. He doesn't hit for much power, though his ability to barrel the ball could translate into double-digit home run totals at the next level if he gets more aggressive.  An average runner, Massey makes little impact on the bases but gobbles up plenty of ground balls on defense. He has great hands and an average arm, and he might be able to handle some shortstop duty in pro ball.

Brecht was an interesting left-handed pitching prospect at the school, albeit one without much present stuff, taken in the 36th round in 2016. Three years of pitching at Santa Barbara later, topped off by an outstanding junior season as the Gauchos' Friday night starter, have moved him firmly into the Day 2 picture.  While Brecht still doesn't have wow stuff, he does throw harder than his high school days and has shown a very good feel for pitching. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but hitters don't see it because Brecht uses his 6-foot-7 frame well to create deception and gets excellent extension so his average heater gets on hitters in a hurry. With good movement up in the zone, he gets a lot of strikeouts with his fastball above the bat. His best secondary pitch is his changeup and he sells it well. His slider is fringy, but he mixes it in effectively.  Brecht has done an outstanding job of throwing quality strikes as UCSB's ace and all of his stuff plays up because of his ability to command the ball, his size and the deception in his delivery.

Interestingly, his stuff has ticked up this spring while his command has regressed a bit.    Known more for his polish in the past, Fellows isn't blowing away hitters but is sitting in the low 90s more often and topping out at 95 mph with his sinker. His low-80s slider is sharper as well, giving him a solid second pitch. He must continue to refine his changeup in order to handle left-handers at the next level.     His pitches may be better, but Fellows hasn't harnessed them as well as he had previously. He has been hit harder and battled his control more than in his first two seasons.

He has improved throughout his college career and could factor in the first five rounds of the Draft.  Wesneski employs a low arm slot and opens early in his delivery, which doesn't thrill scouts but creates tremendous sink. He has averageish velocity on his fastball, ranging from 88-95 mph, but well above-average life that generates a lot of swings and misses as well as groundballs. He also commands his heater well, and the net result is that it plays as a plus pitch.  Wesneski has a sweepy slider that's effective because it moves in the opposite direction from his sinker.

Houston pulled Nix's offer, and a year later he went to the Padres in the third round and signed for $900,000. Nix climbed quickly through the organization, and in 2018 he made his big league debut. Nix slumped to a 7.02 ERA in those nine starts. But he was pushed very quickly to the Majors, and it may ultimately serve as a useful learning experience.   An athletic right-hander with a big frame, Nix generates easy velocity with his fluid delivery and smooth arm action. He operates at 93-95 with his fastball and commands it to both sides of the plate, though it doesn't generate whiffs. Nix's curve gives him a plus breaking pitch. It typically sits in the low 80s with bite and depth, though he saw some of that curveball velocity fall off in 2018. Nix believes he's made a mechanical fix to get that sharpness back, and he needs it. With a diminished putaway pitch, Nix recorded just half a strikeout per inning in his Padres debut.  Nix also owns a changeup that projects as useful but not devastating, and he can throw all three pitches for strikes consistently. His ability to miss bats leaves much to be desired, and he's been prone to big innings.

He has performed steadily since moving into Michigan's rotation as a sophomore and allowed two earned runs or less in his six of his eight Big Ten Conference starts this spring. He should join teammate Tommy Henry to give the Wolverines two pitchers taken in the top five rounds of the same Draft for the first time since 1994 (Heath Murray to the Padres in the third round, Ray Ricken to the Yankees in the fifth).    Kauffmann owns one of the livelier fastballs in the college ranks, usually operating at 91-94 mph, topping out at 96 and holding his velocity deep into games. Its running and sinking action mirrors that of his solid changeup, which he sells well and has good separation from his heater. His slider ranges from 81-86 mph and can be an above-average pitch at times, though it lacks the consistency of his other two offerings.    While Kauffmann has some effort in his delivery, he repeats it well and doesn't have any difficulty throwing strikes. He has a relatively high floor as a three-pitch starter with a track record of performance. His ability to generate ground balls will make him useful as a reliever if he can't cut it in a pro rotation.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","","27","\"2019 Draft Rnd 2 (COL)\"","\"|\"","805","77","\"COL\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","","50","","","","50","","",""],["1117","1114","1116","1147","915","\"40.3\"","\"40.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.7\"","\"46.7\"","\"46.7\"","\"|\"","\"Michael\"","\"Prosecky\"","2019","\"18.3\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"76\"","\"200\"","\"draft\"","151","4","\"|\"","2941","","\"prosecky_michael\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Nazareth Academy HS\"","0","0","","","","37","","\"Pretty well-built lefty, 40 athlete, 89-92 with strong commitment to Louisville.

He limited Marist High (Chicago) and Jason Hodges, the best position prospect among Illinois high schoolers, to one run in five innings in a Wrigley Field showdown in late April. Though Louisville does a good job of holding onto its Chicago-area recruits, his projectability could entice a pro team to buy him away from college.  Prosecky works at 89-93 mph with his fastball, compensating for modest life by using his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and plane. He has plenty of room to add strength and could start reaching the mid-90s regularly once he fills out. He has advanced feel for a changeup, selling it with deceptive arm speed and achieving some fade.  After flashing a solid slider on the showcase circuit, Prosecky has seen it become more fringy this spring and has lost some trust in his breaking ball. He has an easy delivery and repeats it well, allowing him to work both sides of the plate.

He parlayed that into being a seventh-round pick and had a strong pro debut. When he was held back in extended spring training because of an outfield logjam, he sulked and struggled. To his credit, he put it behind him, hit his way out of Lexington once he was assigned, but then willingly returned there to help win a South Atlantic League title as the Legends' cleanup hitter after Seuly Matias got hurt.  Hicklen's power-speed combination makes him a very intriguing prospect. He has plus raw power that is eye-popping when he is on time at the plate, and he'll have to continue to refine his approach in order to make enough contact to tap into that power. His speed is also a game-changer -- he finished third in the organization in stolen bases in just 104 games in 2018 -- and if it all comes together, he has 20-20 potential.  His speed also gives him plenty of range to play center field, but he's likely destined for left field because of his below-average arm.

This year there's another son of a pro in the region in Hill Jr., who has the potential to go in the same neck of the woods in the Draft, and whose father currently manages the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes in the Rockies' system.  Hill Jr. has all the tools and athleticism one would want to see from a high school performer. There's raw power from both sides of the plate and while it's more of a line drive swing from the left side in games, he shows the pop in batting practice regularly with plus raw power overall. He's also a plus runner with basestealing ability, though he was slowed a bit with a hamstring injury earlier this spring. The only question about him on the offensive side is the swing and miss to his game, with some wondering about him making enough contact to tap into that raw pop.  The Arizona State commit has played infield in high school, but there is consensus that he'll move to the outfield at the next level, and he did play out there over the summer.

So after his freshman season with the Bulldogs in 2018, he transferred to Chipola Junior College in Florida. The move has paid off as the infielder has put up big numbers and moved himself into top-five-round consideration this June.  The switch-hitter has shown the ability to hit for average and power in junior college and it's his bat that will carry him. He has easy power from the left side of the plate and has a good right-handed swing as well, with more gap power from that side. A shortstop in high school, Johnson moved to second base at Chipola because they had a superior defender there and, to his credit, he was willing to do whatever was needed to make the team better. He has decent hands and a solid arm and he could get the chance to move back to shortstop after being drafted, though his somewhat limited range might make second the best spot for him long-term.  A loaded Chipola squad had five players taken in the top 10 rounds in the 2017 Draft.

Big, strong and physical, he has tremendous raw power that allows him to launch balls a long way. The rest of his game is a bit raw, though he does show some feel to hit and isn't just a kid trying to pull everything out of the park. While he's not a speedster, he runs pretty well for his size. He makes good and accurate throws from the outfield with his average arm, and he's a capable defender, though he needs to polish his reads and routes. A calm, quiet kid, he gets high marks for his makeup.  Mears is the kind of high school player scouts can dream on, with the potential to be a run-producing right fielder, in a Nelson Cruz kind of mold, when all is said and done.

Contreras, a middle infielder with some present hitting skills, was the only player to hit homer in this year's event.  Big and strong, Contreras has more present strength than some of his fellow Puerto Rican infielders in the class. When he keeps his swing under control, he can drive the ball. He has serious raw power, especially to the pull side, but has the tendency to lose his mechanics and get out of control trying to show off that power. A solid runner when underway, there is some question over whether he has the range to stick at shortstop, though most teams would send him out at the spot and see if he can stick there. He has a plus arm and good enough hands for the position.  If Contreras does slow down as he matures, he still has a future on the dirt, perhaps as an offensive second baseman.

The Phillies drafted him accordingly, taking him No. 10 overall in the first round. After a solid pro debut in the Gulf Coast League, he's struggled to gain much traction. He did spend the 2018 season in Double-A, but hasn't been able to fully figure out what kind of hitter he is.  Randolph has shown glimpses of the hitter everyone thought he could be. In his three full seasons of pro ball, he's had fairly extreme first-half/second-half splits, always taking a long time to get going, but posting a .279 second half average over those three years. When he's going well, as he did again in July and August in Reading last year, he has a good, quick bat from the left side of the plate with some pull power. Originally an infielder, the move to left field has been an adventure at times, but the Phillies feel he'll be an adequate defender.  One problem is that Randolph has gotten caught in between what kind of hitter he is, starting out as a pure hitter, then changing his approach to tap into more power. The Phillies are hopeful that a new hitting program and instructor will help the still-young Randolph figure it out and find some consistency at the plate.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","25","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"42.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","45","40","55","45","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"CLE\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1124","1121","1123","815","1228","\"40.3\"","\"40.3\"","\"40.0\"","\"42.0\"","\"42.0\"","\"42.0\"","\"|\"","\"Josh\"","\"Ockimey\"","2019","\"23.6\"","\"1B\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"215\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1480","656807","","","\"sa829375\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"BOS\"","\"2014, 5th (164) - BOS\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 40 | Power: 55 | Run: 30 | Arm: 40 | Field: 40 | Overall: 40  Ockimey's impressive power display at Fenway Park before the 2014 Draft led the Red Sox to select him in the fifth round and lure him away from an Indiana commitment with an over-slot $450,000 bonus. He does have some of the best left-handed pop in the system and has slammed 52 homers in three years in full-season ball, but Boston chose not to protect him on its 40-man roster after the 2018 season. He scuffled in Triple-A and the Arizona Fall League, adding to concerns that he might be no more than a platoon player without a position.  Ockimey's bat speed, strength and the loft in his stroke allow him to hit the ball out of any part of the ballpark. He's willing to take walks but his hefty strikeout rates (28 percent in his first five seasons, 31 percent in 2018) may hamper his ability to do damage against more advanced pitching. He especially struggles to make contact against better left-handers, and his platoon splits were pronounced last year: .273/.393/.531 versus right-handers, .186/.269/.295 versus southpaws.  Limited athletically, Ockimey has to produce at the plate to have value. He works hard on his conditioning and defense, yet he's still a well below-average runner and shaky defender at first base.

The South Carolina product hit his way up to Double-A in his first full season, reaching the Texas League late in 2016 after Washington had traded him to the A's in August. He returned to the level the following year and recorded his third straight season with a .300-plus average, ultimately hitting .321 over 106 games at Midland. The Cardinals acquired him during the offseason in the Stephen Piscotty trade, only to have Schrock struggle at the plate for the first time in his career over a full season in Triple-A.   After hitting .324 across his first three pro seasons, Schrock uncharacteristically slashed just .249/.296/.331 last year in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League. Some of his struggles were a product of bad luck, as Schrock's .260 batting average on balls in play was well below his .319 career mark. Furthermore, Schrock swung and missed a little more than four percent of the time and struck out in just 7.9 percent of his plate appearances, good for the third-best mark among qualified Triple-A hitters. He also hit the ball in the air more often, albeit with a new pull-heavy approach that proved a culprit in his season-long struggles.   A second baseman only because of his fringy arm strength, he does have solid enough range and hands to profile well there defensively, and the Cardinals even experimented with him at third base and left field last year in Triple-A.

He moved back behind the plate full-time in 2017, when he finished second in the low Class A South Atlantic League in doubles (35) and slugging (.489), then homered twice in the playoffs to help Greenville win the championship. He broke his right thumb when hit by a pitch in Spring Training in 2018, setting the stage for a season in which he played just 53 games amid four trips to the disabled list.  Baldwin is very much an offensive-minded catcher. He's strong and has solid raw power, with most of his home runs presently coming to his pull side. He makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, though he could be more productive if he employed a more patient approach and did a better job of using the entire field.  Because he caught just 187 games through his first five years as a pro, Baldwin is very much a work in progress defensively.

The Mariners took a flier on him in the 23rd round of the 2015 Draft and let him spend most of his first full season as a starter. A move to the bullpen paid off, and he turned in a big California League campaign and was the talk of the Arizona Fall League following the 2017 season. His progress was stalled when a shoulder injury kept him out for most of 2018. The Mariners left him unprotected, but he wasn't taken in December's Rule 5 Draft.  After spending all winter in Arizona, Warren appears healthy and ready to go, with the Mariners hopeful he can get back to the dominant reliever he was in the AFL. He was closing out games, coming in hitting 98-99 mph with his fastball and an absolutely filthy breaking ball. Analytics say his curve is the better pitch, though he also has a good slider with cutting action.  Other than health, Warren's biggest obstacle is his command. He doesn't need pinpoint control, and he has thrown enough strikes at times in the past.

Raw and projectable, he pitched well in full-season ball in 2016, then struggled in 2017 in the Florida State League in a year ended with a scapula stress fracture. He missed all of 2018 because he needed heart surgery to repair a faulty valve. He did return to the mound in the Puerto Rican Winter League and looked good in five starts for Carolina.  More than anything, it was good to get a champing-at-the-bit Hinsz back on the mound in a competitive setting. The bonus was that his stuff was pretty good in Puerto Rico. His fastball was sitting around 92 mph and there's hope he'll get back to more of the mid-90s heat he showed before he was shut down. He throws it with sink and he was back to his ground-ball-out ways with Carolina. He mixed in an average breaking ball and really worked the feel for his changeup, though it's still a fringe-average third pitch.   For a young pitcher who had been on the shelf for a long time, Hinsz's command was very encouraging.

He began his junior year as a starter before being asked to fill Texas' void at closer and cashing in on his first two save opportunities, but he subsequently lost command of the strike zone and returned to the rotation before going to the Nationals in the sixth round that June. He was used as a starter and reliever in his first full season, faring better in the latter role as he finished the year at Class A Advanced Potomac.   Johnston's fastball and slider both are viewed as plus pitches, giving him an ideal pairing for a long-term bullpen role. His heater registers in the low- to mid-90s, at times bumping higher, with arm-side run and late sinking action that nets him a lot of weakly-hit contact. His slider plays more like a cutter, sitting at 88-90 mph with darting action, and he also has a changeup that could become a serviceable pitch if he uses it more often.  There is a lot of effort in Johnston's inconsistent overhand delivery, and it in turn impedes his ability to throw strikes.

MacIver managed the strike zone well and drew some walks while showing some ability to drive the ball.

Like many young middle infielders, he'll make the spectacular play then boot the routine one, but he has the glove and arm to stay at the premium position despite fringy speed. Vargas' bat needs a lot more work and he hasn't developed much in terms of impacting the ball or pitch recognition, really struggling to pick up breaking stuff.

Garcia's defense has been as good as advertised. He's quicker and more athletic than most catchers and has advanced instincts for someone who first donned the tools of ignorance in 2015. He should become at least a solid receiver and thrower as he gets stronger, and he erased 37 percent of basestealers in his first two pro seasons.  Garcia made some swing changes last summer to help unlock his quick hands and Texas believes he has a chance to become an above-average hitter. His short swing is geared for line-drive contact rather than driving the ball, and he may never provide more than gap power.

It seems as though the upper levels of the minors have begun to take advantage of Palacios' epicurean pitch selection, as his numbers continued to decline in 2018.

His raw stuff continued to improve throughout his college career, though, and the Nationals took notice, eventually selecting Bourque in the 14th round that June. He struggled as a starter early in his pro career surrounding Tommy John surgery in 2015, but moved to the bullpen in 2018 and promptly took off in the new role, turning in a strong first half with Class A Advanced Potomac, then posting a 0.92 ERA over 15 appearances after a July promotion to Double-A. After the season, the Nationals added Bourque to their 40-man roster.   A big and physical right-hander, Bourque will show two plus pitches in any given outing. He reaches 97-98 mph with his heater and throws it with late life that makes it difficult to lift for hitters on both sides of the plate. His breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper 80s with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease. Pitching at two levels in 2018, Bourque averaged 12.9 strikeouts-per-nine, with a 16 percent swinging strike rate.   Bourque's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control (4.4 walks-per-nine in '18) a lesser issue, though there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels.

Bush already is a physical presence as a teenager and has plenty of strength and bat speed in his right-handed swing. He has a disciplined approach, working counts and using the entire field, but he needs to add some loft to his stroke because too much of his hard contact last summer came in the form of ground balls. If he can make the necessary adjustments, he could become a .280 hitter with 20 or more homers per season.  Mostly a shortstop in high school, Bush became a full-time third baseman after turning pro.

His strength and bat speed create plus raw power and he understands that he doesn't have to swing for the fences to produce home runs.  While scouts like French's offense more than his defense, he gets the job done as a catcher. The Clemson recruit has solid arm strength though it plays more as average because he doesn't have a quick exchange. He moves well enough behind the plate and has the hands to become at least an average receiver.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","715","910","\"CLE\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","35","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1139","1136","1135","1135","987","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.1\"","\"46.1\"","\"46.1\"","\"|\"","\"Matthew\"","\"Barefoot\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"RF\"","\"R\"","\"L\"","\"72\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2938","","\"barefoot_matthew\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Campbell\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2023","37","","","\"Bacwards guy with a weird swing, but has power and feel for the barrel.\"","\"|\"","\"Campbell\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-matthew-barefoot-of?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>    Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45    Recruited primarily as a pitcher, Barefoot chose Campbell because it was the only school that would give him an opportunity to hit. He missed his entire first season following ankle surgery but starred as a redshirt sophomore in 2018, winning the Big South Conference (.364) and Cape Cod League (.379) batting titles and the Cape MVP award. Undrafted a year ago, he turned down free-agent offers during the summer and should go around the fifth round this June.    A rare player who bats right-handed and throws left-handed, Barefoot has a lot of movement and effort in his unorthodox swing but makes it work with good hand-eye coordination. His feel for contact stands out more than his power, though he has driven the ball more consistently this spring. He makes the most of his solid speed on the bases and is a threat to steal.    Despite his quickness and an arm that has been clocked up to 94 mph on the mound, Barefoot has played mostly left field for the Fighting Camels. He has the tools to be a better defender and would profile more as a regular if he could handle center field, where he'll likely get an opportunity in pro ball. Some clubs were interested in drafting him as a pitcher a year ago, but he wasn't interested and worked only one regular-season inning in 2019.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","","45","\"2019 Draft Rnd 6 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","916","196","\"HOU\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"RS Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"46.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","45","55","60","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1140","1137","1136","1136","957","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","\"Andre\"","\"Pallante\"","2019","\"20.7\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"203\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2929","","\"pallante_andre\"","","","\"|\"","","\"UC Irvine\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2023","37","","","\"Six-foot-righty has four average-to-slightly-above pitches and starter traits, but his fastball/slider are the main weapons and the heater can hit 97 mph in short bursts.\"","\"|\"","\"UC Irvine\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-andre-pallante-rhp\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  As a high school junior in 2015, Pallante helped San Clemente High School win the National High School Invitational, then went on to join the Irvine pitching staff. After a freshman season spent largely in the bullpen, he jumped on the national radar as a sophomore All-American starter. He's kept on performing as the Anteaters' Friday night starter, giving him the potential to go in the top five rounds of the Draft.  While he's not the prototypical starting pitcher in terms of height, the six-foot right-hander does have a lot of arm speed and strength. And he's worked hard to turn himself into more of a pitcher compared to the thrower he was earlier in his amateur career. He can still go get 96-97 mph at times, but is more comfortable sitting in the 91-94 range with a fastball that has cutting and some sinking action to it. He throws both a slider and a curve, and while the former might be a tick ahead of the latter, some feel he might be better served focusing on the curve to differentiate from his fastball more. He sells a future average changeup well and knows how to pitch backwards when needed.  While Pallante doesn't have the cleanest arm action, with a little stab in the back, he repeats his delivery well and tends to be in sync, leading to a lot of strikes. That gives him the chance to stick in a rotation long-term, with the ceiling of a No. 4 type starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"STL\"","","38","\"2019 Draft Rnd 4 (STL)\"","\"|\"","825","125","\"STL\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","50","55","","","","50","","",""],["1141","1138","1137","1137","958","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"39.3\"","\"46.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","\"Trevor\"","\"McDonald\"","2019","\"18.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"74\"","\"180\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2971","","\"mcdonald_trevor\"","","","\"|\"","","\"George County HS (MS)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","37","","","\"Popup prep arm is regularly 91-94, touching 96 mph and his curveball flashes above average but is a limited projection reliever for many teams.\"","\"|\"","\"George County (Miss.)

That prospect was supposed to be catcher/right-hander Logan Tanner, but he has been surpassed by McDonald, who broke out by reaching 95 mph in a January showcase. He acquitted himself well during the spring, dominating highly touted Jerrion Ealy and Jackson Prep in March and fanning 30 in a pair of playoff starts in April.    McDonald regularly sits at 91-93 mph with running action on his fastball and should hold his velocity deeper into games as he gets stronger. His low-80s slider isn't as reliable yet but projects as a second solid offering, and he also owns a curveball with good depth. Though he hasn't needed a changeup very often, he has shown the makings of a decent one with some sink.    McDonald's arm action is a bit long but he repeats his delivery well and generally throws strikes. He comes with some concerns about his size, listed at what scouts believe is a generous 6-foot-2, and his lack of history against quality competition.

When that catcher comes from a cold-weather area like western New York State, even more patience is needed. The Orioles initially drafted Heim from Amherst High School in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft. He made it to full-season ball in 2015, but missed a large chunk of that year with a foot injury. With his bat not developing, Baltimore sent Heim to Tampa Bay in August 2016 in return for Steve Pearce. He was on the move again after a year with the Rays, coming to the A's to complete the Joey Wendle trade. Things started to click a bit in his first year with Oakland and he reached Double-A for the first time, though he struggled once he arrived.  A long-limbed, switch-hitting backstop, Heim stands out more for his work behind the plate than at it. He receives well and has a strong arm that's allowed him to throw out just over 34 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. Heim started to swing the bat with a bit more authority over the past two seasons and hit well in the California League before stumbling post-promotion. He has more of a line drive approach now, but he shows some raw power in batting practice and still has room to add strength. While it's more leverage than bat speed, you can dream on some future pop.  The A's would love to see Heim play with a little more urgency. A slow heartbeat for a catcher isn't a bad thing, but some added energy could help him reach the big leagues as a backup backstop.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","29","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"41.6\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","35","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1143","1140","1139","813","1236","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"40.0\"","\"41.7\"","\"41.7\"","\"41.7\"","\"|\"","\"Garrett\"","\"Williams\"","2019","\"24.7\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","330","624526","\"williams_garrett\"","","\"sa738512\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"SF\"","\"2016, 7th (215) - SF\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  Williams first made a name for himself on the mound by striking out 17 batters in a game at the 2007 Little League World Series. He projected as a possible first-rounder as both a prepster and collegian, but surgery to correct thoracic outlet syndrome before his senior high school season dropped him to the 33rd round (Padres) in 2013 and control woes undermined him at Oklahoma State. A seventh-rounder in 2016, he thrived at two Class A levels in his first full pro season but regressed terribly in Double-A last year.  When Williams repeats his delivery and maintains his low-three-quarters arm slot, his fastball and curveball can grade as well above-average offerings. At his best, he can reach 96 mph with riding life on his fastball and snap off nasty low-80s breaking balls with power and depth. He didn't keep his mechanics together nearly as well in 2018 as he did the year before, resulting in a low-90s heater and a more benign curve.  Williams' fading changeup also was less effective last season, when he also suffered from the control issues that plagued him as an amateur. The Giants were encouraged by the progress he made in six Arizona Fall League starts and plan on keeping him in the rotation. Simplifying things by moving him to the bullpen could give him crisper stuff in shorter stints, though he'll still have to throw more strikes.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","20","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"41.7\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","45","60","","","","","40","","",""],["1144","1141","1087","1246","967","\"40.2\"","\"40.4\"","\"37.9\"","\"46.3\"","\"39.7\"","\"46.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jacob\"","\"Gonzalez\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"3B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"190\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","2148","669363","\"gonzalez_jacob\"","","\"sa3004691\"","\"|\"","","\"Chaparral HS (AZ)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"Though he looked somewhat better defensively during January workouts, Gonzalez still projects over to first base for all the scouts we've spoken with, and his inability to hit breaking stuff makes that pretty scary.

After finishing third in the Rookie-level Arizona League batting race (.339) in his pro debut, he found the going much rougher in low Class A in 2018. He lapsed into survival mode, which had a detrimental effect on his right-handed swing, so he spent the offseason reworking his stroke.  Though he only hit nine homers and slugged .365 in his first two years as a pro, Gonzalez's carrying tool is his raw power. When he began to struggle, he concentrated too much on making contact and got too handsy and inside-out with his swing. The projectable strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame give him the potential for 25 homers per season if he can improve his plate discipline and makes a conscious effort to drive the ball more often.  Gonzalez has good instincts and works hard on his defense, yet that may not be enough to keep him at third base. He has soft hands but below-average quickness and stiff actions, which may prompt a move to first base down the road. He has the solid arm strength required at the hot corner but needs to improve the accuracy of his throws after making 30 errors in 94 games last year.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"SFG\"","\"A\"","26","\"2017 Draft Rnd 2 (SFG)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","19","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"38.6\"","\"48.2\"","\"43.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","30","30","60","45","40","55","40","55","70","40","40","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","55","40","55","40","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"MIL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1145","1142","1037","1377","327","\"40.2\"","\"40.6\"","\"37.0\"","\"50.4\"","\"45.8\"","\"50.8\"","\"|\"","\"Adam\"","\"Laskey\"","2019","\"21.2\"","\"LHP\"","\"R\"","\"L\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","259","7","\"|\"","1751","","\"laskey_adam\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Duke\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2023","37","","\"Oft-injured lefty has average stuff, depends more on feel and his changeup.\"","\"Laskey spent most of his 2019 junior season injured, but has average stuff when healthy.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","","40","\"2019 Draft Rnd 19 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","818","582","\"CHC\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"45.8\"","\"50.8\"","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","45","45","50","45","","","","50","50","55","50","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1146","1143","1141","1126","1033","\"40.1\"","\"40.1\"","\"39.3\"","\"45.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"45.7\"","\"|\"","\"Logan\"","\"Driscoll\"","2019","\"21.6\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2982","","\"driscoll_logan\"","","","\"|\"","","\"George Mason\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"Converted catcher has tools to stick behind the plate, 55 arm, solid average raw power and some offensive skill, but is still pretty raw and faced mid-major competition.\"","\"|\"","\"George Mason\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-logan-driscoll-c?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  George Mason University has had just three players taken in the top 10 rounds of the June Draft since it was instituted in 1965. The most successful from that group was catcher Chris Widger, who spent parts of 10 years in the big leagues after being a third-round pick in 1992. A fellow Patriots backstop, Driscoll hopes to follow in Widger's footsteps, though it's unlikely he'll hear his name as early in the Draft.  Driscoll has a solid track record with the bat at George Mason, hitting well over .300 in each of his three seasons as a starter, though he did appear over-matched against quality pitching in the Cape Cod League last summer. For most of his college career, he's shown outstanding contact and on-base skills, drawing as many walks as strikeouts. Early on this spring, he was selling out on his swing trying to get to his power, but went back to his contact-first approach from the left side of the plate and got back to staying through the ball more effectively. Driscoll also runs very well for a catcher, even stealing some bases along the way. His best defensive tool is his above-average arm and while he is an acceptable receiver, he does need to work on his setup behind the plate.  There's a dearth of catching, especially in the college ranks, in this year's class, which will certainly help Driscoll's status.

The Raiders have two more position players who should go on day two of the 2019 Draft, with most scouts preferring Gray ahead of outfielder Peyton Burdick.     Gray features plenty of strength in his 6-foot-3, 205-pound frame and has upped his power production as a junior. His bat speed is more ordinary, so he'll need to show he can do damage with wood bats after a so-so showing in the Cape Cod League last summer. A left-handed hitter, he's exhibiting more plate discipline than he has in the past.    Gray moves well for a big man and makes the most of his below-average speed on the bases.

Franklin is physically mature for his age, with a body that's built for starting games but also requires further projection. A good athlete with a clean arm action, he's been clocked up to 95 mph and sits comfortably in the low 90s with heavy sink when healthy. His power 11-to-5 curveball has late bite and the makings of a plus pitch, and he's made strides in improving his changeup since entering the professional ranks. Franklin's control will require further refinement, but he has all the physical tools to become a strike-thrower with all three pitches.

He set an Elon record with 147 strikeouts in 105 innings as a sophomore in 2018, when he also pitched well in brief stints with the U.S. collegiate national team and in the Cape Cod League.     Brnovich's success results primarily from a single pitch, an 82-85 knuckle-curve he can manipulate to have either deeper or more lateral break. It may be the best breaking ball in the college ranks. He has spent most of the spring working with an 88-91 mph fastball with some sink and run, though he reached 94 mph as a reliever with Team USA last summer, and he also has a changeup with some fade.    He throws a lot of knuckle-curves and Brnovich figures to rely even more heavily on his breaking ball as a pro because he's almost certainly headed to the bullpen. Scouts don't love his delivery, which includes a short arm action, plenty of effort and some head whack, though it does help him hide the ball. He has battled the strike zone more than ever this spring and lacks fastball command.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","","33","\"2019 Draft Rnd 8 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","827","241","\"LAA\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","50","70","","","","","45","","",""],["1150","1147","1145","1130","1019","\"40.1\"","\"40.1\"","\"39.3\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","\"Will\"","\"Ethridge\"","2019","\"21.4\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"220\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","1811","","\"ethridge_will\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Ole Miss\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2022","37","","\"Prep projection case finally had the velo show up this spring, working 92-95 with heavy sink and a chance to start.\"","\"Prep projection case finally had the velo show up during his draft spring, working 92-95 with heavy sink and a chance to start.\"","\"|\"","\"Mississippi\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-will-ethridge-rhp?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>    Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45    Ethridge starred at Parkview High (Lilburn, Ga.), going 13-0 as a junior in 2015 and winning the clincher in the Georgia state 6-A championship series that also wrapped up the No. 1 national ranking. His talent dictated that he would have gone in the top five rounds of the 2016 Draft, but he fell to the Mariners in the 35th because he was set on attending Mississippi and becoming part of college baseball's top recruiting class. After two years as a reliever, he has fared well as the Rebels' No. 1 starter.    Ethridge excels at pitching to contact with a 91-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95, creating groundballs and awkward swings with sink and the extension in his low-three-quarters delivery. His low-80s slider can be a solid offering when he stays on top of it, though it also can get sweepy and slurvy at times. His fading changeup similarly varies between effectiveness and inconsistency.    Strong and durable, Ethridge does a nice job of repeating his simple mechanics. He doesn't overpower hitters but he puts his pitches where he wants and limits damage done by walks or home runs. He's one of the safer bets in this year's college class to become at least a back-of-the-rotation starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"COL\"","","28","\"2019 Draft Rnd 5 (COL)\"","\"|\"","819","159","\"COL\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","","50","","","","50","","",""],["1151","1148","1146","1131","1020","\"40.1\"","\"40.1\"","\"39.3\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","\"Yohanse\"","\"Morel\"","2019","\"18.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","228","6","\"|\"","3019","678353","","","\"sa3005685\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2024","37","\"D938kI1r2JY\"","","\"Morel had just arrived in the U.S. last year when the Nationals sent him to Kansas City as part of the Kelvim Herrera trade. At age 17, Morel performed against older competition while being asked to adjust to a new country and parent organization at the same time. His stuff was still strong in the fall, where he was 90-94 with a mid-80s, split-action changeup that was often plus.

The Royals hope that's the case with Morel, one of the three prospects they got from the Nationals in the Kelvin Herrera trade. Signed in July 2017 for $100,000, the teenager had pitched just once in the Dominican Summer League before he was traded, then came to the United States and fared well in the rookie-level Arizona League while making his Royals organization debut.  Strong and stocky, Morel stands out for his quick arm and what could eventually be consistent premium velocity. He dominated at times in the AZL with a fastball that was up to 94-96 mph at times and a slider, thrown 83-84 mph, that flashes plus at times. He shows a very advanced feel for his changeup, especially given his age. Morel's delivery can be a bit too upright and he's worked with the Royals to change that for long-term health. With a little recoil at times, he doesn't always allow himself to finish the way he should, another area of focus.  Morel doesn't have much track record as of yet, but could start being recognized as the prize of this trade this season as he truly begins his pro career in earnest, spending nearly all of the 2019 season at age 18.

However, Okey's bat has regressed in many ways as his anemic 2017 and 2018 numbers have shown while his prospect stock continues to trend the wrong way. Part of that might have been because of a right wrist/hamate injury that he tried to grind through on his own for a long time before he alerted the medical staff.    Okey doesn't have the statistics to show it, but there was a feeling he took some better at-bats in Double-A. Now the consistency of his approach really needs to come into focus for 2019 to give him a chance to get back to the decent hitter with some extra-base pop to tap into that he showed glimpses of before the injuries hit.    Behind the plate, Okey has impressed with his defensive play and it appeared to improve in 2018. He has gotten good marks for being able to work well with pitchers and call a good game while showing solid blocking and receiving skills. His best bet at a big league career will be as a defensive-minded backup, but he'll have to improve his offensive profile to reach that ceiling.  \"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"40.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","40","45","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","\"KC\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1153","1150","1148","803","1257","\"40.1\"","\"40.1\"","\"40.0\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"|\"","\"Jose\"","\"Trevino\"","2019","\"26.5\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"211\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","957","624431","\"trevino_jose\"","16725","\"sa827368\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"TEX\"","\"2014, 6th (186) - TEX\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 35 | Run: 35 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 40  A starter at three different positions (third base, catcher, shortstop) in three seasons at Oral Roberts, Trevino became a full-time backstop in his first full pro season after signing as a sixth-rounder in 2014. He won Rawlings Minor League Gold Gloves in both 2016 and 2017 before making his big league debut last June. He tore the labrum in his left shoulder in his first game back in the Minors and underwent surgery in July, ending his 2018 season.  Trevino is the complete package defensively. From a physical standpoint, he receives and blocks extremely well while getting the most out of his strong arm by using a quick release and making accurate throws. He also draws praise for his ability to call a game, run a pitching staff and not let his offensive struggles affect his work behind the plate.  After batting .239/.278/.326 during the last two seasons in Double-A, Trevino looks more like a defensive-minded backup in the mold of Jeff Mathis than a regular in the big leagues. He does put the ball in play from the right side of the plate, but he makes a lot of weak contact and doesn't offer much in the way of power, walks or speed.

He lasted until the ninth round that June, in part because he battled shoulder soreness during the spring, then struggled as a starter in his pro debut. He took off when he became a full-time reliever last year, advancing from low Class A to Double-A with a 1.29 ERA and 81 strikeouts in 48 2/3 innings.  Karinchak misses bats with two pitches that play well off of each other. He has a 93-96 mph fastball with riding life that he can throw by hitters at their letters, and a 12-to-6 curveball that he can get them to chase out of the bottom of the zone. He also threw a changeup/splitter as a starter but doesn't use it much while coming out of the bullpen.  His high arm slot adds plane and deception to his pitches, though there's also effort in his delivery that makes it difficult to control them.

He led NCAA Division II in strikeouts (165) and strikeout rate (15.9 per nine innings) in 2017 and became the highest pick in Buffs history, signing for $125,000 as a 13th-rounder.  Kasowski has continued to miss bats as a pro, leading all Minor League relievers in whiffs (111) in 2018 with the highest whiff rate (15.4 per nine innings) among pitchers with a least 60 innings. He does it with basically one pitch, a 91-97 mph fastball that seems to rise at the plate and gets an exceptional amount of swings and misses in the strike zone. He has an over-the-top delivery, similar to Josh Collmenter's, and hitters don't see his heater well because it seemingly comes straight out of his ear.  Kasowski throws his fastball about 75-80 percent of the time and the Dodgers would like to see him mix in a few more sliders and changeups and sequence them better. His curve gets 12-to-6 break thanks to his arm slot but could use more power, while his changeup is less advanced.

While he is still very far away, the Pirates did give Florez $150,000 in July 2016 in the hopes he could eventually join his fellow countrymen at the highest level. The right-hander made his United States debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2018, and though he was slowed by an elbow tweak, he's gotten a clean bill of health this offseason.  The Pirates love Florez's size and power stuff. He's already gained some velocity in his time in the organization, cranking his fastball up to 96 mph, and there's clearly more in the tank as he adds strength to his 6-foot-5 frame. He can also really spin his breaking ball, with a power curve that could eventually be better than average. His changeup remains a work in progress.   There is also much work to be done in terms of his command if he wants to have any chance to start, though his strike-throwing improved from his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2017 and his move to the U.S. The Pirates will let him start for the time being, but seeing him approach triple digits coming out of the bullpen could be fun to watch eventually.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"40.8\"","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","65","40","50","","","","","40","","",""],["1157","1154","1152","807","1246","\"40.1\"","\"40.1\"","\"40.0\"","\"41.0\"","\"41.0\"","\"41.0\"","\"|\"","\"Zac\"","\"Houston\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"260\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3051","667677","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"DET\"","\"2016, 11th (325) - DET\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  A reliever for most of his college career at Mississippi State, Houston raised his profile a bit with some big starts down the stretch of his junior season. The Tigers, who have never shied away from arm strength, took him in the 11th round and immediately returned him to a relief role. After he pitched effectively across two levels of A ball during his first full season of pro ball, Houston excelled at Double-A and Triple-A in 2018, finishing the year on the cusp of the Major Leagues.   Houston combines, size, power stuff and a funky delivery to get hitters out. The 6-foot-5 right-hander employs a jump in his delivery that reminds some of Carter Capps. It helps him create huge extension toward the plate, which in turn gives his fastball a higher effective velocity than 92-94 mph. He mixes in a slider that can be erratic, but helps him miss a ton of bats. He struck out 13-per-nine in 2018, bring his career average to 13.8 K/9.   Houston has generated weak contact and struck out hitters in bunches in his pro career, but his lack of command (career 4.4 BB/9) makes it tougher to see him in a closing role.

He played primarily first base in his 2017 full-season debut and was ticketed to repeat low Class A last year before high Class A Myrtle Beach manager Buddy Bailey wanted Pereda as his starting catcher. He responded with career highs in most categories and earned recognition as a Carolina League midseason all-star.  Pereda lacks showcase tools but possesses a high floor as a potential big league backup with a grinder mentality. His best attribute is his plus arm, which he used to erase 38 percent of basestealers in 2018. He has improved as a receiver and framer but still needs to get more consistent in both areas.  Though Pereda fits at the bottom of a batting order, he possesses some of the best plate discipline in Chicago's system.

Willems has a good swing and can make the needed adjustments at the plate. He showed off more extra-base ability with his 13 doubles and four triples for Greeneville in 2018. He still needs to improve breaking ball recognition and refine his overall approach to improve his K/BB ratio moving forward so he can tap into that power more consistently.    The Reds need to find a position for Willems, who has played mostly third and second base. He's been a little rigid at both positions and likely profiles as a platoon guy or bench player.

A shoulder injury in 2016, after he hit over .300 the prior summer, forced him out for most of the season. He struggled to impact the baseball when he returned in 2017, but rebounded with Class A Advanced St. Lucie in '18, showing some newfound power to go along with his usual strong defense.   Employing a more launch-oriented swing with an emphasis on hitting the ball in the air, Carpio started to tap into some consistent pop in the Florida State League. The result was a career-high 12 home runs across 112 contests after he had hit four homers in 250 games during his first four seasons. He's continued to add strength, too, leading some to believe he may hit for even more power going forward. His feel to hit leaves something to be desired, though he does put together solid at-bats and has a willingness to draw walks. He has the defensive chops to play shortstop regularly, but primarily has played second base in the wake of his shoulder surgery. An average runner, he's smart enough to swipe some bases but needs to improve as a basestealer.

They also gave out a half dozen six-figure bonuses, starting with Rivero, a catcher out of Venezuela who was given $450,000 to sign. He spent the 2018 season sharing catching duties with MJ Melendez during his full-season debut.  Rivero has the kind of intangibles teams love to see in their catchers. He learned English quickly to help him work with his pitching staff and he's an excellent game-caller and receiver. He also has a plus arm that allowed him to throw out more than 35 percent of potential basestealers in 2018. While the right-handed hitter's offense is behind his glove work, he has shown some potential with the bat. He has displayed excellent bat control and doesn't strike out much. He'll never be a big power guy and understands his role, with the profile of being a bottom of the order hitter.  Rivero and Melendez fed off of each other in 2018 and the Royals hope they continue to do so, with Rivero helping Melendez become a better overall defender and Melendez helping to push Rivero offensively. It reminds some in the organization of the relationship between Salvador Perez and then-catcher Wil Myers in the Minors, with the hope Rivero can still develop into a big league regular as a result.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","27","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"41.1\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","30","60","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1162","1159","1160","1116","1126","\"40.0\"","\"40.0\"","\"39.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"44.3\"","\"|\"","\"Carter\"","\"Young\"","2019","\"18.3\"","\"SS\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"170\"","\"draft\"","151","4","\"|\"","2947","","\"young_carter\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Selah HS\"","0","0","","","","37","","\"Plus athlete and shortstop defender who can switch hit.

Struggles during the 2018 Tournament of Stars carried over to the rest of his summer, but he used those difficulties to motivate him to return to a level of consistency during his senior year in Washington.  When Young is going well, he can do a little bit of everything well, even if he doesn't have a carrying tool that jumps off the page. The switch-hitter can drive balls in the gaps and can stay inside the ball and go the other way when needed while showing good command of the strike zone. There's bat speed and he could eventually approach average power when he physically matures. Young runs well and has excellent instincts, both on the basepaths and defensively, where he is a natural leader. He has the hands, actions and arm to play shortstop, though some think second base might be his long-term home. He's also athletic enough to handle the outfield if need be.  Young gets as high marks for his feel for the game and intelligence as he does for his tools.

Ortiz's best quality is his ability to stay at shortstop long-term. He has really good hands and first-step quickness to go along with enough arm to stick at the premium position. The right-handed hitter has a solid approach at the plate with very good bat-to-ball skills that have allowed him to hit over .400 this spring.

He's a well below-average runner who can clock some bottom-of-the-scale times down the line when he takes a big swing.

Though he was old for the NWL at age 21, Arias has advanced hitting skills. With a compact right-handed swing, nice feel for the barrel and a disciplined approach, he drills line drives to all fields.

Scouts appreciated Grae's steady play but were underwhelmed by his package of tools -- though now they're reconsidering him after he hit .405 in Southeastern Conference play as a junior.     Kessinger was a career .248 hitter before league play began this spring, but as one evaluator said, \"You don't hit .400 in the SEC by accident.\" He has a history of making contact with a controlled right-handed swing and line-drive approach, and he has hit the ball harder than ever in 2019. He draws walks and plays quicker on the bases than his below-average speed out of the box, though he has modest home run power at best.    Kessinger makes plays at shortstop despite lacking classic tools for the position. He's not twitchy or flashy and his arm is merely average, yet he compensates with instincts and positioning.

He made up for his lost year by leading the Horizon League with a 2.13 ERA and winning conference freshman of the year honors in 2017. He also pitched well in the Cape Cod League and continued to thrive as a redshirt sophomore in the spring, helping Wright State win the Horizon League title. And when the D-backs made Weiss their fourth-round pick in June, it cemented his status as the Raiders' best pitching prospect since Joe Smith was a Mets third-rounder in 2006.  The 6-foot-4 right-hander operates at 91-93 mph and can hit 96 with his fastball. He uses his height well, creating angle to the plate with an overhand delivery, though it can cause his heater to flatten out when left up in the zone.   He mimics his fastball arm speed when throwing his changeup, and it shows flashes of becoming a solid pitch with some fade and sink.

He dominated as a freshman closer on LSU's 2017 College World Series runner-up team before moving into the rotation the next two years to fill a need for the team. He hasn't been nearly as effective as a starter and missed time this spring with a groin injury, and most pro clubs project him as a late-inning reliever.    When he finished games as a freshman, Hess pumped his fastball into the upper 90s and backed it up with a wipeout slider in the mid 80s. As a starter, he usually operates with a 91-95 mph fastball and a solid slider in the low 80s. His 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot create downhill plane and both pitches feature high spin rates, making him difficult to hit.     Hess hasn't shown much feel for a changeup and won't need it much if he shifts back into the bullpen in pro ball. He has toned down his delivery as a starter but he still throws with a lot of effort, and his arm action and fringy control are two more factors pointing to a future as a reliever. He could race to the big leagues if utilized in that role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"DET\"","","31","\"2019 Draft Rnd 7 (DET)\"","\"|\"","816","202","\"DET\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","","60","","","","45","","",""],["1172","1169","1170","801","1260","\"40.0\"","\"40.0\"","\"40.0\"","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"40.2\"","\"|\"","\"Patrick\"","\"Mazeika\"","2019","\"25.6\"","\"C\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"208\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1840","664850","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"NYM\"","\"2015, 8th (239) - NYM\"","","2019","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 35 | Run: 30 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  Up until the 2018 season, Mazeika had hit at every point in his career. He parlayed a career .348 average and .469 on-base percentage into an eighth-round selection by the Mets in the 2015 MLB Draft, then led the Appalachian League in doubles (27) and OBP (.451) and finished second in batting (.354) in his pro debut. He posted a .305 average the next year in his full-season debut, which he followed with a .290 average and .389 OBP in 2017 while reaching Double-A. Returning to the Eastern League in 2018, Mazeika struggled at the plate for the first time in his career, slashing .231/.328/.363 in 87 games at Binghamton.   Mazeika has used a contact-first approach to hit .311 in his pro career heading into the 2018 season, while his strike zone discipline is also advanced, leading to a .413 on-base percentage as well. Right now he is all about line drives to the gaps from the left side of the plate, but he does have close to average raw power that his approach doesn't let him get to. The Mets will continue to work with Mazeika on small mechanical changes to try to tap into that pop a little, though he'll always be hit over power. He doesn't look pretty behind the plate and needs to continue to work on his receiving and game-calling, but he manages to get the job done, throwing out nearly 31 percent of would-be basestealers in his career.  The Mets are confident he can stick behind the plate, and left-handed hitting backstops are always a hot commodity, at least as backups. If he can continue to hit and find a way to add a little power, he might outperform those projections.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","25","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"40.2\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","50","35","30","45","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1173","1170","1106","1245","984","\"40.0\"","\"40.3\"","\"37.9\"","\"46.1\"","\"38.0\"","\"46.9\"","\"|\"","\"Quin\"","\"Cotton\"","2019","\"21.2\"","\"LF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"71\"","\"200\"","\"draft\"","145","4","\"|\"","2961","","\"cotton_quin\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Grand Canyon\"","0","0","","","","35","","","","\"|\"","\"Grand Canyon\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-quin-cotton-of\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 40 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  Cotton played his high school ball at Colorado powerhouse Regis Jesuit and went on to play for Andy Stankiewicz at Grand Canyon.

Cotton lacks one truly loud tool, but can do a lot of little things to impact the game. He has a contact-oriented approach and rarely strikes out, though he doesn't draw a ton of walks, either. He'll show off raw power in batting practice, but it has yet to show up in games.

He always exhibited one of the strongest arms among the system's position players, so Boston decided to try the outfielder-to-lefty reliever conversion that worked well with Williams Jerez, who made his big league debut after going to the Angels in the Ian Kinsler trade last July. Aybar was understandably raw in his first year on the mound but improved during the course of 2018.  Aybar threw 90-93 mph fastballs when he first took the mound but was sitting at 94-97 and hitting 99 at the end of the season and in instructional league. Though he's still gaining feel for his secondary pitches, he'll flash some sharp sliders in the mid-80s when he's on. His changeup is rudimentary but can leave right-handers off balance on occasion.  Aybar's athleticism has helped him in his career change, as he throws a decent amount of strikes while he's still learning to keep his delivery in sync. It's still too early to know what he'll become, but his pure stuff could make him a late-inning weapon if he can develop consistency. One club official watched him work out and said it was the best bullpen session the system had seen since Michael Kopech, who was part of the Chris Sale trade with the White Sox and might have the most devastating fastball/slider combo of any current prospect.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BOS\"","\"A\"","28","\"2013 J2 (BOS)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","29","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","","","","1.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","45","","55","","","","45","","",""],["1175","1172","1172","1109","1173","\"39.9\"","\"39.9\"","\"39.3\"","\"43.6\"","\"43.6\"","\"43.6\"","\"|\"","\"Tony\"","\"Locey\"","2019","\"20.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"240\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2901","","\"locey_tony\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Georgia\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"Emerged in high school hitting the mid-90's, wasn't used a ton at Georgia, then emerged as their second best starter this year.

While there's debate as to whether he winds up as a starter or reliever in the long run, there's no question that he has one of the best arms in college baseball's top conference.  Locey operates at 92-95 mph and touches 97 with his fastball, using his high-three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. He maintains his velocity throughout his starts and figures to hit 100 mph if he works shorter stints out of the bullpen. His low-80s slider can be sharp and a solid pitch when he commands it, and he also shows promising shape on a curveball that's a work in progress.  Mostly about power, Locey hasn't shown much of a changeup. He's strong and physical, though to remain a starter he'll have to do a better job of repeating his delivery and commanding his pitches.

Phillips helped Magnolia West win its first-ever district title and breeze through the first three rounds of the state 5-A playoffs, tossing three complete-game victories (including two shutouts) in his first three postseason starts.  While Phillips has a pair of potential plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, both still require some work. He operates at 90-94 mph, reaches 96 and holds the velocity on his heater deep into games, but it gets hit harder than it should because batters see the ball well coming out of his long arm action and high slot. He spins his upper-70s curveball with power and depth, though he sometimes struggles to land it in the strike zone.

The Phillies took a flier on him in the 16th round of the 2017 Draft, immediately moved him to the bullpen and watched him pitch his way across three levels to Double-A in his first full season.  With three pitches that at least flash plus, Dohy has nasty stuff that allowed him to strike out nearly 15 batters per nine innings in 2018. All of it comes from the lefty's aggressive, up-tempo and funky delivery. He gets up to the mid 90s with his fastball consistently and he complements the heater with two excellent secondary offerings. His mid-80s slider is often a plus pitch, and his changeup is more average, though sometimes it's the other way around. With his delivery, command is going to be an issue, and he'll likely always be a control over command type of reliever.  Dohy struggled in Double-A, partially because of fatigue at the end of his first full season and partially because the more advanced hitters at the level were laying off his chase pitches out of the zone.

But the right-hander experienced numbness in his arm and hand when he got back on the mound, prompting surgeons to treat him for thoracic outlet syndrome by removing one of his ribs to alleviate a pinched nerve. When his symptoms failed to improve, Murphy had a nerve removed from his elbow.

Big and strong, Murphy will sit at 92-95 mph and touch 97, throwing his heater with downhill plane and sinking action that makes him difficult to barrel. His power curveball flashes plus, registering at 75-79 mph with tight spin and late bite, and he shows feel for throwing a firm changeup that improved as the season played out. What's more, Murphy racked up more strikeouts in 2018 (8.4 K/9) than at any point in his career and led all Minor League hurlers (140 IP min.) with a 59.1 percent ground-ball rate.   More important than the results, Murphy stayed healthy for the entire season, accruing 152 2/3 innings across 27 starts. There are a range of outcomes in projecting Murphy's development, but more and more the signs are pointing to a bright future for him as a Nos. 4 or 5 starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"TOR\"","\"AA\"","30","\"2013 Draft Rnd 3 (TOR)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","17","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","55","","","","","45","","",""],["1181","1178","1178","1115","1141","\"39.9\"","\"39.9\"","\"39.3\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","\"Zach\"","\"Peek\"","2019","\"21.1\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"205\"","\"draft\"","299","8","\"|\"","2966","","\"peek_zach\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Winthrop\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","37","","","\"WIll bump 95, changeup progressed this year, curveball has always been fine, if unspectacular.

Florida torched him for 10 runs in his third start of the season and he has battled his control and command for much of the spring. He did lead the Big South Conference in strikeouts for the second straight year, however, and still should fit in the first five or six rounds.    Peek uses both a low-90s sinker and a harder four-seam fastball, and he can maintain his velocity into the late innings. His curveball hasn't been as sharp as usual, though it still flashes good depth and he's throwing it for strikes. He masks his changeup well and it features some fade.    Peek has a clean delivery and repeats his high-three-quarters arm slot well. If he can regain the feel for his curveball and for locating his pitches that he has displayed in the past, he could have a solid three-pitch repertoire and make it as a No. 4 starter at the next level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAA\"","","35","\"2019 Draft Rnd 6 (LAA)\"","\"|\"","837","181","\"LAA\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","55","50","","","","","45","","",""],["1182","1179","1179","798","1264","\"39.9\"","\"39.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"38.9\"","\"38.9\"","\"38.9\"","\"|\"","\"Riley\"","\"Delgado\"","2019","\"24.3\"","\"INF\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"70\"","\"175\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","3039","676629","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"ATL\"","\"2017, 9th (260) - ATL\"","","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 20 | Run: 45 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40    Delgado began his post high-school career at Columbia State Community College before transferring to Middle Tennessee State, following in the footsteps of his older brother Dustin. The starting shortstop for the Blue Raiders, Delgado hit .369 over two years there, leading to the Braves drafting him as a senior sign in the ninth round of the 2017 Draft. While he signed for just $1,000, the infielder has continued to hit as a pro as well, posting a .315 average in his first full season of pro ball in 2018.    The 5-foot-10 Delgado continues to show a knack for making a lot of contact that has carried over to the 2019 season. He is capable of spraying line drives to all fields and while he doesn't walk a ton, he also rarely swings and misses, keeping his strikeout rate at or below 10 percent for his career, though that comes without any power. A shortstop only at Middle Tennessee State, Delgado played the premium position almost exclusively during his first year-plus in the Braves system. He's added more second and third base to his resume, with the ability to play solid defense at all three spots, in 2019.    At 24-years old for the 2019 season, Delgado is a little old for his level. But as a money-saving senior sign, he's in many ways way ahead of where expectations were. He'll have to prove himself at every level, but he could carve out a career as a steady utilityman who can hit for average at the highest level.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","30","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"38.9\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","20","45","50","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1183","1180","1180","799","1262","\"39.9\"","\"39.9\"","\"40.0\"","\"39.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"39.3\"","\"|\"","\"Brennon\"","\"Lund\"","2019","\"24.5\"","\"OF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"69\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","70","2","\"|\"","1805","641807","\"lund_brennon\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","\"ANA\"","\"2016, 11th (336) - LAA\"","","2020","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 30 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 50 | Overall: 40  The last outfielder from Brigham Young University to spend any time in the big leagues was Jaycob Brigman, who was up with the A's for 48 games in 2017.

Lund is the type who gets the complimentary label from evaluators as being a \"baseball player.\" At his best, he's a table-setting type who gets on base and uses his legs to help his team win. He still strikes out a bit too much, but he did draw walks in 2018 and can shoot line drives to all fields with a flat swing path, albeit without any real power. He's stolen 20 or more bases two years in a row and that should continue to be a big part of his game.

The Tigers took Woodrow in the 12th round that June, signing him for $150,000. He's done nothing but produce as a pro, using his blend of hitting ability, speed and defense to move quickly through the Tigers' system. He was a Midwest League All-Star in his first full season and played just five games at Class A Advanced Lakeland at the outset of 2018 before advancing to Double-A, where he was an Eastern League All-Star and produced a .317 average with 23 steals. After the season, Woodrow continued to boost his prospect stock with a strong turn in the Arizona Fall League.   Woodrow has a good feel for what he's doing at the plate. His approach is geared toward hitting the ball back up the middle, and he does so often using a short left-handed swing. While Woodrow's contact is mostly of the ground-ball variety, it actually plays into his strength because he's a plus-plus runner with well-below-average power. Woodrow is a skilled bunter, with the ability to lay it down either line, and he's an aggressive, sometimes over-aggressive basestealer. He fared better against same-sided arms (.340 average) than righties (.301) in Double-A.   Woodrow's wheels enable him to play center field, and he's seen significant time at all three outfield spots in full-season ball.

Newsome thrives with plus plus command of a four-pitch mix. Velocity-wise, his fastball is average, though he's throwing harder than he has previously, in the 90-94 mph range. But it plays up thanks to his pinpoint control and good riding life. His changeup is below-average, but he plays it well off of his fastball with a little arm-side run and good late bottom to it. He manipulates his above-average slider in the zone and adds shape to it when expanding it late in counts. His curve doesn't have a ton of shape to it, but he can put it wherever he wants. He'll throw all four of his pitches at any point in the count to keep hitters guessing.

He drew an 80-game suspension in January 2018 after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance, excelled as a full-time reliever after his return and made his big league debut in September.   Deetz worked mostly as a tandem starter before he reached Triple-A, where he got hit hard taking a normal turn in a rotation. As a starter, he operated with a low-90s fastball that peaked at 95 mph and a low-80s slider with a big break. His stuff kicked up when he took a relief role, with his heater parking at 94-97 mph and reaching 99 mph while his slider sat in the mid-80s with sharper break.

Ortiz has had injury issues every season dating back to his senior year of high school, and his fastball, which already plays down due to a lack of extension, was slower than usual during his brief big league debut with the Orioles last year.

He had already reached the Double-A level as a 20 year old in 2016 when the Brewers acquired him and Lewis Brinson in the Jonathan Lucroy-Jeremy Jeffress Trade Deadline deal. Two years later, Ortiz was on the move again at the Deadline, this time heading to Baltimore with Jonathan Villar and Jean Carmona in return for Jonathan Schoop. Bumped up to Triple-A after the trade, he pitched well there and made his big league debut as a reliever in September. Making his first MLB start the following week, Ortiz suffered a hamstring injury while covering first base that ended his season and raised more questions about his already suspect durability.   Ortiz's stuff was down across the board during his brief big league stint as he sat around 92 mph with his fastball and showed little feel for his slider and changeup. The big right-hander has been up to 97 mph with his heater in the past, though, with a low-80s slider that flashes plus and a changeup that might be average once fully developed. While throwing strikes has never been an issue for Ortiz, his ability to command his pitches has backed up at higher levels, in part because he's struggled to stay in shape.   The concerns that scouts had about Ortiz's weight and conditioning prior to the Draft have continued in the pro ranks, and he was especially out of shape at the time he was traded to the Orioles. The good news is that Ortiz is now committed to improving physically and has shed 20-plus pounds from his 6-foot-3 frame during the offseason.

An inconsistent junior season has kept him from reaching that bar again this spring, making it a bit tougher to gauge when in the Draft he might get selected.  A solid athlete with a good 6-foot-3 frame, DeVito has still shown glimpses of the three-pitch mix that had scouts excited for his junior year. He'll be up to 94 mph with his fastball consistently, sitting 91-92 mph more often than not. At times, when he gets good extension, he has good life on the pitch, at others, he's seen his fastball get barreled up. His breaking ball will occasionally flash above-average, but he has a tendency to collapse his front leg when he throws it. His go-to pitch has been his changeup, which he sells well and can throw with fade to both sides of the plate.   DeVito's inconsistency with his delivery and release point has impacted his command as well, but he has shown a better ability to throw quality strikes in the past.

It was Alex Faedo's turn in 2017, while both Brady Singer and Jackson Kowar were taken in the opening round of the 2018 Draft. A strong spring could have vaulted Dyson into that realm of this year's Draft, but the right-hander has struggled, losing his spot in the Gators' rotation.  Dyson still has plenty of power to go after hitters when he wants it. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph, and he consistently reaches the mid-90s. But a lack of life has meant it's gotten hit hard when he throws it for a strike. He has struggled to throw his slider, which had flashed plus in the past, for a strike, and he hasn't been able to develop a reliable third pitch, so college hitters have been sitting on the fastball. He has a tendency to not drive through the ball and can be too rotational, giving hitters too good of a look at the ball coming out of his hand.  Because of his struggles, scouts have a hard time projecting Dyson as a starter at this point. If he can refine his fastball-slider combination, some see a ceiling as a setup type who can pitch the seventh or eighth inning, though a team taking him early in the Draft could send him out as a starter with the hopes of fixing what's ailed him this spring.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","","22","\"2019 Draft Rnd 5 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","800","153","\"WSH\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Junior\"","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"43.3\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","45","","50","","","","45","","",""],["1190","1187","1188","1107","1178","\"39.8\"","\"39.8\"","\"39.3\"","\"43.4\"","\"43.4\"","\"43.4\"","\"|\"","\"Leonel\"","\"Valera\"","2019","\"19.9\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"165\"","\"professional\"","228","6","\"|\"","2778","665987","","","\"sa917320\"","\"|\"","","\"Venezuela\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","\" \"","\"An atypical Venezuelan shortstop prospect, Valera has a big, projectable frame, plus bat speed, and a laser arm.

He offers an interesting mix of tools for an infielder but is still very much a work in progress.  Valera has a quick right-handed swing and a projectable 6-foot-1 frame, so he could develop 12-15 homer pop once he matures physically and turns on more pitches.

He does a nice job of using his solid speed to beat out infield hits and steal bases.  With smooth actions and a strong arm, Valera has the makings of a solid shortstop. He also has seen action at third base and a bit of time at second base, and his tools should play anywhere in the infield. Whether he becomes a regular on the left side of the infield or a utilityman will depend on the development of his bat.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAD\"","\"A\"","32","\"2015 J2 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","21","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"43.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","40","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1191","1188","1189","1108","1179","\"39.8\"","\"39.8\"","\"39.3\"","\"43.4\"","\"43.4\"","\"43.4\"","\"|\"","\"Nate\"","\"LaRue\"","2019","\"17.8\"","\"C/RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"203\"","\"draft\"","151","4","\"|\"","2939","","\"larue_nate\"","","","\"|\"","","\"McGill-Toolen HS\"","0","0","","","","37","","","","\"|\"","\"McGill-Toolen Catholic (Ala.)

Christian High's Ethan Hearn could be the first prep catcher selected in 2019, there are scouts who believe he's not the best in his own city. They prefer LaRue's superior athleticism and think he'll be a better hitter and receiver. There also are evaluators who wonder if LaRue might have a future on the mound, where he shows a low-90s fastball and closed out the clinching game as McGill-Toolen Catholic won its first state 7-A title in May.  A former outfielder who's more athletic than most catchers, LaRue moves well behind the plate. He's already an average receiver and should continue to improve as he gains more experience. He has a solid, accurate arm that could play as plus if he can learn to quicken his release.  LaRue's proponents like his relatively compact right-handed swing and his willingness to use the opposite field, though some scouts wonder if he'll make regular contact against more advanced pitching. The Auburn recruit has solid raw power and lets it come naturally rather than worrying about home runs.

That has remained the case after two-plus years of Minor League baseball. It also puts the organization in a bit of a quandary. Can Alf-Rod's glove alone carry him to the big leagues?    Offensively, Rodriguez hasn't shown much sign of progressing. That could partially be because of a hamate bone issue in 2018 that required two trips to the disabled list. But he also played in the instructional league and Arizona Fall League after the season and still didn't hit well. Plate discipline remains a stumbling block as he often swings and misses pitches out of the strike zones. A light hitter like Rodriguez needs to work counts and draw walks to get on base.    The contrast couldn't be wider on the defensive side. His hands could be a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale and he has good range and a plus arm to go with them, making it possible to make all the routine plays and many spectacular ones as well. Although his glove could play in the big leagues, the reality is that Rodriguez is a projectable utility player at best if he doesn't figure out how to hit.  \"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","29","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"38.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","30","50","60","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1193","1190","1140","1376","603","\"39.8\"","\"40.1\"","\"37.0\"","\"48.7\"","\"45.0\"","\"49.0\"","\"|\"","\"Johan\"","\"Quezada\"","2019","\"24.8\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"78\"","\"200\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","3242","","","","\"sa736898\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2020","37","","\" \"","\"After parts of five seasons in rookie or short-season ball, and one on the shelf for a shoulder surgery, Quezada finally made his full-season debut in 2018, just a few days shy of his 24th birthday.

On paper, Cecchini was very intriguing as a young pro because he played shortstop and had such terrific control of the strike zone, but eyeball evaluations were more generic, indicating a bench role at best, and were incongruous with Cecchini's performance, especially when he suddenly had power. He was sidelined for much of 2018 after he was struck by a pitch on the foot, but he put enough balls in play to note that his pull rate was up and his ground ball rate was down, and a hitter with this kind of innate talent would suddenly become very interesting if a swing change were to coax out some more power.

A revamped swing with an emphasis on driving the ball in the air had Cecchini poised for a breakthrough performance in 2018, and he was swinging the bat well in Triple-A until a bone bruise on his right foot in May landed him on the disabled list for nearly fourth months.   With his above-average bat-to-ball skills, Cecchini has a strong track record of barreling up the baseball while maintaining low strikeout rates. Hitting for power will never be a part of his game, though he impacted the ball more consistently in 2018 after adding leverage to his swing and improving his point of contact. Defensively, Cecchini has been a bit enigmatic. He'll show an above-average-to-plus arm at times, more than enough to play shortstop, but he's had enough trouble making accurate throws that he is now primarily a second baseman, where he is solid defensively.   The Mets designated Cecchini for assignment during the offseason, but kept him in the system after he went unclaimed on waivers.

Still somewhat of a work in progress on the mound, Paciorek could have two plus offerings once he's fully developed. His best is an 82-85 mph slider that's a legitimate strikeout pitch. He usually works at 90-94 mph and can hit 96 with his fastball, with more velocity to come as he gets more experience.  Paciorek impresses with his athleticism and his arm works well.

Willing to gamble on the Alabama prepster's upside, the Brewers grabbed Lemons with their second-round pick and signed him for $1.45 million. Since then the club has handled the ultra-thin right-hander with extreme caution, limiting his workload in each of his first two pro seasons.   While Lemons' fastball touched the mid 90s in high school, he's pitched more in the 90-92 mph range as a pro. There should be more velocity on the way, as Lemons has plenty of room to grow into his projectable 6-foot-6 frame. His slider is his best secondary offering, with the potential to be at least average, and he can also mix in a curveball and changeup, both fringy. Like so many young pitchers, Lemons struggles to repeat his arm slot, making it difficult for him to stay on top of his breaking pitches and control his entire arsenal. He should gain better feel for his mechanics as he begins to fill out his slender frame.  The Brewers are still getting a feel for Lemons, who has seen limited time on the mound despite never being officially diagnosed with an injury.

After an up-and-down freshman campaign, Fall has been dominant as a sophomore, moving up the ranks of top junior college talent in the 2019 Draft class.  Fall certainly looks the part, with a strong, physical 6-foot-6 frame and a clean arm action and left-handed delivery. He'll be up to 94 mph consistently with his fastball, though not with a ton of deception as hitters can pick the ball up early because of a slightly lower slot. Fall does flash a solid breaking ball, but tends not to get on top of it. He'll try to throw a cutter and a slider as well, but can get caught between them and either needs to stick with the slider because of his arm slot being so far away from his head or raise his slot a little and go with the curveball. The changeup is below-average right now, but there is some feel for it with the hopes of it become a viable option once he starts throwing it more.   Fall had originally committed to St. John's before switching to Brookdale, and he would head to Arizona State should the Draft not work out.

His breaking ball can be slurvy, sometimes looking like a curve, sometimes having more slider shape to it, and it should be at least average in time. His changeup is a work in progress, but he does show some feel for it.   Keane does have a very easy arm action and while there are kinks in his delivery, he's athletic enough to believe he'll work those out and become a solid strike-thrower.

After a strong summer and fall on the showcase circuit, Nesbitt's Draft profile took a leap forward and that got bigger schools interested, leading to Nesbitt switching gears to the University of Florida. That, plus a senior season that hasn't been quite as good as his summer, makes his Draft status a bit more of a question mark.  The 6-foot-3 right-hander is a projection arm with some stuff to dream on. He was in the low-90s for much of the summer, and his velocity has backed up a bit to more in the 89 mph range this spring, but there is definitely more in the tank. His breaking ball is below-average currently, as it gets slurvy, but has the makings of a decent slider in the future. He hasn't thrown his changeup much, so that's a work in progress, though it showed decent action over the summer. He generally repeats his delivery and throws strikes.  Any team interested in Nesbitt is going to have to exhibit patience on the player development side, but knows there could be a future starting pitcher in there to unlock.

Sanchez is an exceptional defensive catcher by all standards. He's a plus receiver who blocks well and already calls a good game, with plus-plus arm strength and similar catch-and-throw skills that enabled him to throw out 42 percent of attempted basestealers in 2018 -- bringing his career caught-stealing rate to just under 47 percent. As a hitter, Sanchez has decent contact skills and doesn't strike out a lot, but he also doesn't impact the ball as consistently as one would hope based on his bat-to-ball abilities.   Defensive-minded backups don't have to hit a ton, but they do have to show some ability to handle the bat to get there. Sanchez did a better job of that in 2018, and the Mets believe he'll continue to make improvements with experience.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","26","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"37.5\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","40","30","40","65","60","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1202","1199","1200","796","1258","\"39.7\"","\"39.7\"","\"40.0\"","\"40.3\"","\"33.6\"","\"40.9\"","\"|\"","\"Delvin\"","\"Perez\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"170\"","\"professional\"","160","4","\"|\"","1705","666206","\"perez_delvin\"","","\"sa917935\"","\"|\"","","\"Int'l Baseball Academy HS (PR)\"","1","-1","","\"High\"","2021","40","\"zoyhWdJpeQU\"","","\"As a high schooler in Puerto Rico, Perez looked like he had a chance to be a five-tools monster.

An uneven senior season after that hurt, though he was pitching well as the Draft approached. The Phillies nabbed him in the ninth round and went way over pick value to sign him away from his California commitment for $800,000 and sent him out for his debut in the Gulf Coast League.  Pipkin has the chance to have three average or better pitches when all is said and done. Tall and lean, the right-hander has a live and loose arm that currently throws a fastball anywhere in the 88-94 mph range. There's plenty of room for him to add strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, so dreaming on more consistent velocity is easy. He mostly threw his slider during his pro debut, and it shows flashes of a plus pitch, and the hope is he'll be able to mix in an average and distinct curveball, as well. He shows some feel for his changeup, but that is also a work in progress.  With a free and easy delivery, Pipkin should be able to be a consistent strike-thrower as he gets more reps.

When he followed that up with 11 shoutout innings for USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team, he looked poised to be one of the more intriguing college lefties in the 2019 Draft class. But a forearm issue slowed him early as his velocity dipped, hurting his stock considerably, though he was pitching better as the Draft approached.  At his best, Feole leans heavily on his fastball-curve combination. When he's 100 percent healthy, he'll sit around 90-92 mph with his heater. His breaking ball is a pure curveball that he throws a lot as his out pitch. It will flash plus at times, but he doesn't always land it consistently. He does have a below-average changeup, but rarely is asked to throw it. An unorthodox delivery that includes a head snap adversely impacts his command on a regular basis.  Having put the forearm injury behind him helps his stock, but because of the effort in his delivery and his difficulty in finding the strike zone consistently, most see a move to the bullpen in Feole's future.

As usual, he looked like he was in control of two excellent secondary pitches much more than his mid-90s fastball. When the Low-A South Bend's season began a few days later, Albertos had issues finding the strike zone and lasted just a single inning. The problem snowballed, and his' control unravelled throughout the course of the year. He walked 32 hitters in 13.2 innings at South Bend, then was sent back to extended spring training for a month before he was reassigned to short-season Eugene, where he walked 33 in 17.2 innings, at times throwing fastballs in the mid-80s just to try to throw a strike. This happens to athletes in various sports from time to time, but not often enough for us to have developed refined ways of helping athletes deal with it, so we just don't know if Albertos will bounce back. We do know he is very talented. He had three plus pitches at age 19. There was concern about his physical composition and release variability, though remedying one of those things might aid the other. If that were to happen, he could move quickly because his stuff is already in place. Hopefully, Albertos can flush 2018. He's only 20 and has above-average starter stuff if he can compose his body and mind. \"","\"|\"","","\"CHC\"","","\"July 27, 2015 - CHC\"","2022","40","\"Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 40 | Overall: 40  Purchased from the Mexican League's Tijuana Bulls for $1.5 million in July 2015, Albertos created buzz in his pro debut 11 months later, showing a plus-plus changeup and two other quality pitches in a now-legendary outing in the Rookie-level Arizona League. He has done little since, however, getting shut down immediately afterward with forearm tightness and pitching just 43 innings on tight pitch counts in '17. Last year was a disaster, as his control completely fell apart and he finished with a 14.84 ERA and 65 walks in 30 1/3 innings.  When he's right, Albertos sells his changeup well and it seems to disappear at the plate. He can sit at 93-95 mph and touch 97 with his fastball, though at times last year he worked in the upper 80s while trying to trade velocity for location. He also has flashed a plus curveball, though it's less advanced than his other offerings because he uses it less often.  As his struggles mounted, Albertos lost his confidence and his ability to keep his delivery in sync, making matters worse. His issues seem to be more mental than physical and questions have risen about his dedication. He's still just 20, so he has plenty of time to get back on track.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"CHC\"","\"A\"","20","\"2015 J2 (CHC)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","\"38.3\"","\"50.0\"","\"42.5\"","\"|\"","0.7500","0.0000","0.0000","-1.0","-2.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","2000","2600","20","60","55","55","","","","40","60","60","60","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","55","60","50","","","","","40","\"BAL\"","0.500","\"XXX\""],["1207","1204","1255","1241","1210","\"39.5\"","\"38.5\"","\"37.9\"","\"42.5\"","\"42.5\"","\"42.5\"","\"|\"","\"Manuel\"","\"Silva\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"LHP\"","\"L\"","\"L\"","\"74\"","\"145\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","3009","665563","","","\"sa917865\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","1","0","","\"High\"","2022","37","","","\"A twiggy, projectable lefty, Silva struck out a batter per inning in the New York-Penn League at age 19.

He's moved incrementally, from the Dominican Summer League, to the Gulf Coast League to the New York-Penn League, over three summers of pro ball, performing well at all three stops.  The word that comes up the most when evaluating Silva is \"projectable.\" He shows the makings of a three-pitch mix and the ability to throw them for strikes that gives hope he can remain a starting pitcher long-term. He typically sits in the low-90s with his fastball, touching a bit higher at times, and he should add some velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame. His fastball plays up because of its life and he backs it up with a slider and changeup that both need to be developed, though the former is ahead of the latter. He both missed bats and got weak contact on the ground consistently in 2018, though he'll need to refine his command.  It's hard to know exactly what Silva, who will be 20 years old for all of 2019, will become.

Short won't wow anyone with the velocity on his fastball, which usually ranges from 88-90 mph and tops out at 93, but it's an effective pitch because it features nice sink and he commands it so well. His best offering is a mid-70s curveball with quality depth, and he can turn it into a harder slider with sharp break. He also demonstrates feel for a changeup with some tumble.  His pitches play up because Short throws them all from the same high three-quarters slot, making it tougher for hitters to figure out what's coming.

He spent all of 2018 at Class A Lansing, earning midseason All-Star honors in the Midwest League.  Vicuna's defensive abilities at shortstop are his calling card. He has ultra athletic and at times flashy actions, with quick, twitchy hands that help him absorb anything hit his way and execute a quick release that in turn makes his arm strength play up.

That didn't mean they couldn't find talent, as they signed Yan as a 16-year-old in August 2015 for just $80,000.         The 5-foot-11 southpaw has seen his velocity creep up since he signed and he now averages 92 mph with his heater and can reach back and touch 96 mph on occasion. He can miss bats with a curve that has outstanding depth and should be a reliable above-average breaking ball in the future. He shows some feel for a changeup that could be close to average when all is said and done.         The biggest thing holding the 20-year-old, who made his full season debut in 2019, back is his command.

Ayala High School in Chino Hills, Calif., has had some pro prospects grace its field, but it's been a while. There have been a pair of second-round picks from the school, including Ryan Mount in 2005, but Mount was actually the last player drafted from the school. Naranjo, perhaps the best bat in the area, should end the dry stretch.  While he isn't the biggest or most projectable guy in the world, the six-foot Naranjo can really hit. He's one of the better pure hitters among the high school set in the country and proved that during the summer showcase circuit. The left-handed hitter can hit lefties, should continue to hit for average as perhaps a future plus hitter and should get to at least Major League average power, with over-the-fence pop showing up well during his senior season. He's a bit limited beyond the bat, though he plays above his speed on the basepaths with good instincts and is a solid defender at first. Some think that he could play an outfield corner, with an arm that touches the upper 80s on the mound.  To profile at first or right field, there will be more pressure on Naranjo to develop into a true run-producing type of hitter. The Cal State Fullerton commit's offensive potential could get him drafted in the top five or six rounds.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","738","101","\"CLE\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"48.4\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","50","40","50","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1215","1212","1254","1373","1082","\"39.2\"","\"38.5\"","\"37.0\"","\"45.0\"","\"30.0\"","\"46.4\"","\"|\"","\"Sam\"","\"McMillan\"","2019","\"20.5\"","\"C\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"195\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","2135","675913","\"mcmillan_sam\"","","\"sa3004277\"","\"|\"","","\"Suwanee HS (FL)\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2023","37","","","\"He lacks strength/bat speed but McMillan is more athletic than the typical catcher, and he's starting to put together an interesting plate discipline track record.

He continued to raise his profile by hitting 97 mph at a tournament in Arizona during his first outing of his senior season in March. Though he hasn't lit up radar guns as consistently this spring, few high school pitchers in this Draft can match his combination of peak velocity and projectability.    Rustad's fastball fluctuated with the weather in the Midwest, parking at 90-93 mph on some days and at 88-91 on others. He could operate in the mid-90s on a regular basis once he fills out his lean 6-foot-5 frame. He uses his size to create difficult angle and his heater also features high spin rates, as does a low-80s slider that gives him a sharp second pitch when he stays on top of it.    His changeup still is in the early stages of development, but Rustad shows some feel for it.

Buehler was more polished and Collyer needs to get a lot stronger, so he may not get picked high enough to divert him from attending Clemson. He has the potential to blossom into a first-round pick after three years of college just like Buehler did.  Though he lacks physicality, Collyer has an electric arm capable of running fastballs up to 96 mph and sitting at 90-92 with running action. His frame easily could add another 30 pounds, after which he might operate in the mid-90s and push triple digits. He also flashes promising power on his slider, which lacks consistency but can be a plus pitch when he stays on top of it.  Collyer also shows the makings of an effective changeup, though he doesn't need to use it much against high schoolers. There's a lot going on in his delivery, which includes excessive effort and some head whack that impede his ability to command his pitches.

He won't overpower batters but has one of the higher floors among Chicago's mound prospects.    Flores' fastball velocity has varied over the years but has settled at 89-92 mph with a peak of 94 -- he has hit 97 in the past -- and stays off barrels with its riding life. His best offering is a changeup that gets some well above-average grades when at its best. He improved his curveball and refined a slider/cutter last season, though both are mostly average pitches.    After battling his control and command in college, Flores has developed into one of the best strike-throwers in the system.

He's now operating in the low 90s with nice sink on his two-seamer and topping out at 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has impressive feel for spin, using both an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a low-80s slider with tighter bite.  As is the case with most high school pitchers, Southard's changeup lags behind his other offerings because he hasn't had much need for it. There's effort in his high-three-quarters delivery, which can lead to inconsistent control, but his athleticism should allow him to make improvements.

He earned all-Atlantic Coast Conference honors as a freshman in 2016 but didn't pitch because of bone spurs in his elbow, then missed all of 2017 following an operation to remove the spurs and subsequent Tommy John surgery. He has succeeded at the plate and on the mound the last two years, including a stint in the Cape Cod League, and could go in the top four or five rounds as a redshirt junior position player.  English prefers hitting to pitching and has convinced most scouts that he has a brighter future as an everyday player. He has made huge strides this spring with his ability to translate his strength into power production and make consistent contact from the right side of the plate. He could continue to improve further if he focuses solely on hitting and develops more patience.  English moves well for a 6-foot-3, 214-pounder and has close to average speed once he gets going. He plays a quality first base and should be able to handle right field, though the Yellow Jackets have taken it easy on him defensively because he doubles as their closer.

He then suffered through a particularly rough batting practice session in front of a ton of scouts at the East Coast Professional Showcase, swinging through several offerings. That hurt his stock as an offensive player and some scouts prefer him on the mound, though he is very raw as a pitcher.  While concerns about Rivera's swing and miss have not abated, he did barrel up the baseball more consistently during games at the East Coast Pro Showcase, as well as at other events. He is power over hit for sure, with plus raw power that could allow him to be a run producer if he hits enough to tap into it. He runs well enough and his solid arm makes him fit the right field profile pretty well. The left-hander has only been pitching for about a year, so he would be a bit of a project. But he does have plenty of arm strength, with a fastball up to 94-95 mph. He does show a solid breaking ball when he's on, he definitely has a feel to spin it, but it's very inconsistent and often gets slurvy. He's struggled to command both pitches at times.  Scouts are somewhat split as to what direction they think the Florida International commit should head in to start his pro career. The swing and miss concerns some so much they'd put him on the mound, with the hope that professional instruction would help sharpen his stuff. Others would at least send him out as an outfielder, knowing they could always return him to the mound should his bat not develop.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","618","121","\"LAA\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","55","45","55","50","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1222","1219","1216","1230","869","\"39.1\"","\"39.1\"","\"37.9\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"47.0\"","\"|\"","\"Jean\"","\"Carmona\"","2019","\"19.6\"","\"3B\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"183\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","2016","672802","","","\"sa3003340\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","37","\"4i402sfEdFA\"","","\"Carmona had such a strong 2017 summer in the DSL that the Brewers sent him to the AZL for the season's final few weeks, where he was instantly of interest to scouts. He had flashy actions at shortstop, above-average bat speed, and he made hard contact through the 2017 fall instructional league despite a long, somewhat stiff swing. When Carmona arrived in Arizona the following spring, he had filled out quite a bit, and his already middling lateral range became a larger issue. He suddenly seemed more likely to end up at third base, though he could potentially be very good there. The Brewers pushed Carmona to the Pioneer League during the summer. He struggled there, and continued to after he was traded to Baltimore in the Jonathan Schoop deal. The bat is very much a work in progress and Carmona is a risk to trend down the defensive spectrum, but he has the physical talent to be an above-average defensive third baseman with some pop if all of his issues are remedied.\"","\"|\"","","\"BAL\"","","\"July 2, 2016 - MIL\"","2021","40","\"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 40  The Brewers signed Carmona for $725,000 out of the Dominican Republic at the outset of the 2016-17 international signing period, and he began his professional career by slashing .302/.406/.447 in the Dominican Summer League before finishing in the Rookie-level Arizona League at age 17. His performance caught the attention of the Orioles, and they acquired him with Jonathan Villar and Luis Ortiz at the 2018 Trade Deadline in the Jonathan Schoop deal.  Carmona has a strong athletic frame with physical projection remaining. How much strength he adds should dictate the impact he makes at the plate, as there are some evaluators who project him to hit for both average and power. His feel to hit should improve as he tightens his approach and becomes more selective. He's viewed as an above-average runner and has the potential to be a basestealer with proper instruction.  Carmona has the arm strength to stay in the middle of the infield and has been praised for his athleticism, instincts and overall defensive tools. Should he outgrow the position, which is a possibility given his projectable frame, Carmona has the defensive chops to handle either second or third base -- positions he saw time at in 2018, on top of his primary work at shortstop.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"BAL\"","\"A-\"","34","\"2016 J2 (MIL)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","23","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"47.0\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","50","55","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1223","1220","1204","1372","887","\"39.1\"","\"39.4\"","\"37.0\"","\"46.9\"","\"38.6\"","\"47.7\"","\"|\"","\"Izzy\"","\"Wilson\"","2019","\"21.2\"","\"RF\"","\"L\"","\"R\"","\"75\"","\"185\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","3227","","","","\"sa877504\"","\"|\"","","\"Saint Maarten\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2021","37","\"FEP73vC2218\"","","\"Wilson burst onto the prospect scene in 2015, hitting 10 homers in 48 games in the GCL at age 17.

He made real progress on that front in 2018, bopping 16 homers and posting a 102 wRC+ in Low-A as a 19-year-old. He's backed into a corner profile-wise, and has to keep progressing at the plate to avoid his upside being the wrong side of a left field/first base platoon.

Most of those prospects were declared free agents by Major League Baseball in the wake of the organization's signing violations. Ramos, who got $250,000 to sign in July 2016, is one who got to stay and has made some nice strides, reaching full-season ball for the first time in 2018.  Ramos fits the profile of a bat-first corner outfielder. It's very much power over hit, though he's worked on improving his swing. Hitting coordinator Mike Brumley is helping him create a more consistent swing that allows him to get to his power more, rather than having to cheat or guess to get to it. While Ramos will never thrill anyone with his defense, he has gotten better there as well. When he made his United States debut in the Gulf Coast League, he couldn't field at all. He's fringy now, with left field the only real option because of his below-average arm.  That puts more pressure on Ramos' bat, and he's going to have to continue to put up high ISO and SLG percentages to get to the big leagues.

Given a chance to close as a sophomore, Little ran with it and tied Colton Hock for the school's single-season saves record. He's added a bunch more as a junior, but some scouts feel he has the repertoire and feel for pitching to start at the next level.  The 6-foot-4 right-hander has the potential to have a four-pitch mix should he get the chance to be in a rotation. He's added a little velocity while at Stanford and can touch 94 mph on occasion, but typically sits in the 90-92 mph range with his fastball. He added a curveball in his sophomore season and it's become his go-to breaking ball. He continues to work on his slider, and some think if he does end up in a bullpen at the next level, that would be a better breaking ball option for him. He can mix in a solid changeup as well.   Stanford has opted to have pitchers with starting potential stay in the bullpen because it's more valuable to be able to use them multiple times over the weekend. That's what they did with Hock, who did get some opportunities to start with the Marlins since he was a fourth-round pick in 2017.

Bannon continued to rake after signing for $122,500 as an eighth-round pick, and the Dodgers deemed him advanced enough to handle a jump to Class A Advanced Rancho Cucamonga to begin his first full pro season. He broke out in the California League and was leading the circuit in home runs (20) and slugging (.559) when the Dodgers packaged him with four other prospects in an All-Star break trade to land Manny Machado. Upon joining the Orioles system, Bannon was promoted to Double-A and shifted from the hot corner to second base.   Bannon's compact frame is loaded with strength, and he knows how to get the most out of it at the plate. A 5-foot-10 right-handed hitter, he sets up with an open stance, then utilizes a big leg kick and upper-cut bat path to generate above-average raw power. It's a unique swing with a lot of moving parts, but Bannon controls it well, consistently getting the bat head through the zone. Of course, such a swing also comes with some swing-and-miss concerns and pull-side tendencies, both of which were exposed a bit during Bannon's time in Double-A.   Bannon saw time at both second and third base in the Dodgers system, then played second almost exclusively after the trade. His average speed, actions and arm strength all profile better at the keystone, though it's a bat-first profile regardless of where he lands on the defense spectrum.

So he headed to the University of Oregon, where he pitched in relief as a freshman before joining the weekend rotation as a sophomore and then becoming the staff ace in 2018. While his performance was inconsistent, his stuff intrigued the D-backs enough that they made him their fifth-round pick. After signing for slot value, Mercer made all but one of his 13 starts in the Northwest League, racking up 37 strikeouts in 27 frames. He struck out eight batters over four one-hit innings in his final regular-season start, then struck out half of the batters he faced over four perfect frames in his only postseason start.   Mercer stands out with his arm strength and power arsenal. His high-spin-rate fastball typically sits around 92-95 mph, but he can reach back for more, flashing a plus 97-mph heater at times, while maintaining his velocity throughout starts. Mercer's secondary stuff was better in his pro debut than during his junior year. His changeup is an above-average offering that plays nicely off his fastball, with late tumble and fading action, and his curveball can earn similar grades from evaluators, even flashing plus at times.   While he does largely throw strikes, Mercer does need to refine his command within the zone. That, plus some effort in his delivery, has some scouts predicting a future in the bullpen, though the D-backs will give him every opportunity to prove himself as a starter.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"ARI\"","\"A+\"","34","\"2018 Draft Rnd 5 (ARI)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","27","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","60","55","55","","","","","45","","",""],["1233","1230","1226","1220","1013","\"38.9\"","\"38.9\"","\"37.9\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"45.8\"","\"|\"","\"Matt\"","\"Peacock\"","2019","\"25.3\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","2755","676840","","","\"sa3004019\"","\"|\"","","\"South Alabama\"","0","0","","\"Low\"","2020","37","","","\"Peacock has a heavy, mid-90s sinker that has enabled him to generate a 78% groundball rate this year.

The D-backs took a flier on him in the 23rd round of the 2017 Draft, and he spent his first summer and the first chunk of his first full year pitching in relief. He got an opportunity to start in May in his first full season and ran with it, earning a promotion from the Midwest to the California League, then opened the following year in Double-A.   Peacock has the chance to have three usable pitches when all is said and done. His bread-and-butter is his heavy sinker that sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph at times. His ability to command the pitch consistently down in the zone allows it to play up and is the reason he led all Minor League hurlers (min. 90 IP) with a nearly 68 percent groundball rate in 2018. His secondary stuff is developing, with a changeup a bit ahead of an improving slider.  There's a chance Peacock ends up back in a bullpen, the kind of reliever who can come in and get a big groundball or double play.

Cole Winn was a first-rounder a year ago, though he had moved to California his senior year. Cornelio's Draft stock isn't quite that high, but he does have the chance to be the first prep arm from the state to go in the top 10 rounds since the Rays drafted lefty Brock Burke in 2014.  Cornelio turned in a solid summer, pitching well for Team USA in the fall, and he's shown some of the same stuff, albeit not as consistently, this spring. The 6-foot-3 right-hander attacks hitters with a fastball that's consistently up to 93 mph, with much more in the tank as he fills out his frame. Many scouts felt his breaking ball was a separator, but it gets caught in between a curve and slider. When he stays on top of it, he misses bats with big bite and spin. His changeup remains a work in progress, and it isn't a pitch he needs at home in Colorado, though he showed some feel for it over the summer. He has a very quick arm and compact delivery. He is more thrower than pitcher, with some effort in his delivery.  Should Cornelio opt to head to Texas Christian University, he can lean on a stronger track record of Colorado prepsters who went on to college and became first-round picks, like Kevin Gausman and Kyle Freeland.

He peaked early in that regard, signing for $100,000 late in the 2016 draft when his catching and hitting didn't progress and he was mostly just a mid-90s arm that occasionally showed command or a breaking ball. That projection has mostly held, as three years later Ryan has reached Double-A as a short reliever, but his breaking ball is consistently average to above and his command has improved, so there's a clear path to becoming a middle reliever.

He passed on signing with the Indians as a 40th-round pick in 2014 and honored his commitment to North Carolina, where he struggled at the plate and made only one appearance on the mound before leaving the team in 2016. The Indians took Ryan in the 30th round that June, signing him for $100,000, then dealt him to the Mets a little more than a year later in exchange for Jay Bruce. He excelled at Class A Advanced St. Lucie early in the 2018 season, earning Florida State League All-Star honors along with a promotion to Double-A.   Ryan shows power stuff out of the bullpen. He'll sit at 95-96 mph and touch 98 with a riding fastball that he pairs with a low-to-mid-80s slider that has a high spin rate and earns above-average grades from scouts. He also has a changeup, but it's a distant third pitch that he seldom throws. After issuing 3.6 walks per nine in his first full season, Ryan made strides with both his control and command in 2018 while trimming his walk rate to 2.5.

Eskew, a two-way player for his high school team, has the chance to join Wilson based on his mound work talent-wise, though signability could come into play.  Eskew is a prototypical projection high school right-hander with a lot to dream on. Velocity-wise, his fastball is average now, up to 92-93 mph. Given his size and solid delivery, not to mention a focus on pitching only, it's easy to envision him sitting in the mid 90s in the future. His fastball is largely straight, with a little run in on right-handed hitters, something that might be addressed if he drops his high arm angle a touch. At times, Eskew will show both a curve and a slider, but they tend to run into each other. He does have feel to spin, and it could end up being a better-than-average pitch once he hones in on one breaking ball. He doesn't throw a changeup much but will show some feel for it in the bullpen. It's a pitch he has the aptitude to learn.   While he is raw, Eskew is a solid strike-thrower, though his command within the strike zone will need to be refined. Many scouts feel that, along with a sharpening of his stuff, will come with more innings and attention to pitching.

He was up-and-down after his return, but turned it up a notch near the end of his season at Kansas, and the D-backs saw enough to take him in the third round and give him $550,000 to sign, just a tick below pick value. He spent the bulk of his pro debut in the Class A Short Season Northwest League, where his stuff was down but he still performed well.   Goddard has a power arsenal of three potential plus pitches when he's at his best. It starts with a 92-94 mph fastball that reaches 97 mph and features some run and sink. Hitters have a difficult time laying off his low-80s slider, giving him a second swing-and-miss pitch, and there are times when his low-80s changeup is his most effective secondary offering, providing contrast to his lively fastball.   Inconsistency plagued Goddard throughout his career and he's often struggled with command, which has led to him being more hittable than he should be given his stuff. The D-backs believe he'll throw more strikes as he learns to better repeat a delivery that currently involves some effort.

He missed two weeks in April with elbow inflammation but returned to the mound with his stuff intact.  Kostyshock's fastball has climbed from 86-89 mph his freshman season to 92-96 two years later, and there could be more velocity to come if he can add some muscle to his lanky 6-foot-4 frame. His long arms and three-quarters slot create deception and difficult angle on his heater, especially against right-handers. His mid-80s slider features lateral break and can be a plus pitch at times, though it also flattens out when he doesn't stay on top of it.  Kostyshock opened the season in Arkansas' weekend rotation, but he made just one start and hasn't shown a changeup since settling in the bullpen.

Sure enough, he finished in the top two in ERA and strikeouts in the organization in back-to-back years (2016-17). The Tigers moved Hall to the bullpen in 2018, only to move him back to the rotation when he reached Triple-A in July. Expanded rosters in September led to Hall's first callup, and with it a return to the bullpen.   Hall's fastball is fringy, at best, barely scraping 90 mph with little movement. His curveball, on the other hand, might be the best in the system. He can really spin it and will throw it at any point in the count, which, in turn, allows his fastball to play up a bit. He can also mix in an effective changeup at times. Hall's ability to pitch off his curve has long been one of his strengths, but without much in the way of velocity, that approach has the potential to be exploited by good hitters.

On the one hand, they might have more upside and ceiling because of a lack of good weather to pitch in. On the other, they might not have the same track record against good competition to compare to other prep arms from around the country. Limoncelli helped offset that some with a strong summer, but questions about his health when his stuff backed up as things warmed up in New York this spring, and it turned out he needed Tommy John surgery.    Over the summer, Limoncelli routinely was touching 93-94 mph with his fastball with a repeatable delivery and loose arm action. When he broke out of the gate only up to 89 mph this spring, it was easy to chalk that up to it being his first outing, and one of the first times he'd been able to throw outside this year. He was up to 92 mph early in his second start, but the velocity fell off quickly, leading some evaluators to worry about his health. He can spin his breaking ball decently and while he does have a changeup, it's decidedly behind the other two pitches. He generally is a strike-thrower.    While Limoncelli has limited projection when healthy, there is enough in his three-pitch mix to garner interest.

Willeman operated with a low-90s sinker in college but came back from his elbow reconstruction with a mid-90s heater that topped out at 100 mph. His breaking balls also gained significant power as well, with his curveball becoming a low-80s hammer and his slider creeping into the low 90s. He has yet to show much feel for his changeup.  Los Angeles will deploy Willeman in longer stints and see how he and his arsenal hold up before determining whether to develop him as a starter of a reliever. There's not a lot of deception in his delivery and he didn't have a track record of throwing strikes before he got hurt, so he'll need to improve his command and control when he faces more advanced hitters. He'll be 23 and has worked just 19 innings in pro ball entering the 2019 season, so he desperately needs more experience.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"LAD\"","\"A\"","30","\"2017 Draft Rnd 19 (LAD)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","28","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"45.0\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","70","40","60","60","","","","40","","",""],["1244","1241","1238","1204","1159","\"38.7\"","\"38.7\"","\"37.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"43.9\"","\"|\"","\"Jaxx\"","\"Groshans\"","2019","\"20.9\"","\"1B\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"209\"","\"draft\"","145","4","\"|\"","2930","","\"groshans_jaxx\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Kansas\"","0","0","","","","35","","","","\"|\"","\"Kansas\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-jaxx-groshans-c?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>  Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45    Groshans went deep six times in 20 at-bats in his first six games this year -- exceeding the total of five homers he hit in his freshman and sophomore seasons combined. The older brother of Jordan Groshans, the 12th overall pick in the 2019 Draft, he obviously couldn't maintain that pace but has ranked among the home run and walk leaders among NCAA Division I catchers all spring. A club that believes in his ability to remain behind the plate could take him as early as the fourth round.    Before his breakout, Groshans showed the ability to make consistent contact to all fields with a repeatable right-handed swing during two solid summers in the Cape Cod League. He has gotten stronger and is making a more concerted effort to pull and drive the ball as a junior. He also has shown increased plate discipline as opponents have tried to pitch around him more often.    Groshan's biggest backers note his work ethic and are confident he can become at least an adequate receiver once he improves his concentration, though other scouts are more skeptical. His arm plays as average and could tick up with a quicker release and better accuracy.

Washington has tried him in the rotation and in long relief and Braymer has been fairly successful at both, but he projects as a two-pitch reliever long-term.

He transferred from the junior college program to Auburn the following year, pitched well in multiple roles for the Tigers and then became the Nationals' 18th-round pick in June, signing for $100,000. As a pro, Braymer has continued to flex his versatility on the mound while succeeding in a host of roles. The left-hander was particularly impressive in 2018, leading Nats farmhands in ERA (2.28) and finishing third in strikeouts (118) while pitching in 28 games (11 starts) across two levels. In recognition of his season-long success, Braymer was named the Nationals co-pitcher of the year, sharing the honor with Wil Crowe.   Braymer showed last season that his stuff would play regardless of his role. The left-hander works with a 92-93 mph fastball and has bumped a few ticks higher in the past, albeit without much in the way of late movement. He complements his heater with an above-average curveball with 12-to-6 action that is lethal on left-handed hitters -- they batted just .174 against Braymer in '18 -- and a changeup gives him a distant third pitch.   The Nationals are quick to praise Braymer for having the mental toughness needed to successfully bounce between starting and relieving. As with some of the other pitchers in the system, he'll likely be deployed as a starter in 2019 to refine his secondary pitches and overall command. But given his proven effectiveness against lefties, Braymer is probably ticketed for a bullpen role.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"WSN\"","\"AA\"","25","\"2016 Draft Rnd 18 (WSN)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","24","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","50","40","55","","","","","50","","",""],["1246","1243","1240","1206","1135","\"38.7\"","\"38.7\"","\"37.9\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"44.2\"","\"|\"","\"Glenn\"","\"Otto\"","2019","\"23.2\"","\"RHP\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"77\"","\"240\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","2123","657248","\"otto_glenn\"","","\"sa915710\"","\"|\"","","\"Rice\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","37","","","\"Otto was a reliever at Rice (winces) who the Yankees wanted to develop a changeup and try to start, but he missed nearly the whole 2018 season with a blood clot issues in his shoulder.

He made just two starts in 2018, however, before having surgery to remove a blood clot from his pitching shoulder.  Otto's best pitch is a spike curveball that combines power and 12-to-6 break, and it can be well above-average at times and difficult to control at others. He works at 92-95 mph and touches 97 with his fastball, which returned to full strength during instructional league last fall, though it remains to be seen if he can maintain it with a full starter's workload. He had little use for a changeup in college and developing one will be a point of emphasis in 2019.  Otto has overwhelmed hitters with pure stuff and never has displayed reliable control or command, so he'll have to be more efficient with his pitches to remain in the rotation. He has a strong build and his arm works well, which should bode well for his durability, though he did miss time as a Rice junior with a tired arm and Owls pitchers have a poor track record of holding up in pro ball.

The right-hander began his career throwing in the low-90s, but has since been able to crank it up consistently to the mid-90s and touches 100 mph, especially in shorter relief stints. His fastball can be straight at times, something he'll have to work on as upper-level hitters catch up to his velocity. He'll show a power curveball around 80 mph which can morph into something that looks more like a slider when he doesn't stay on top of it. He does have some feel for a changeup, but it's not as important in a relief role.    Lara does struggle with control and command, though it doesn't need to be pinpoint in relief, and there were questions about his durability due to his frame and funky arm action.

Philip has had a solid season as Oregon State's leadoff hitter, though a hamstring injury kept him off the field for a stretch this spring.  With a strong and sturdy build, Philip is an athletic shortstop who should be able to stay at the position. He has good hands and more than enough arm for the spot and his speed, which also gives him some basestealing ability and helps him in terms of range. At the plate, he's shown the ability to make hard contact with good bat speed. He has gap power to all fields and can drive the ball very well the opposite way. While his hamstring issue slowed him temporarily, he was back to full strength as the Draft approached.

An elbow sprain kept him from making his debut over the summer and he didn't pitch at instructs, adding to questions about his durability, as nagging injuries hampered him during his college career. The good news is there were no issues during the offseason, and he was coming back well from rehabbing the injury. At his best, he has four quality pitches at his disposal: A fastball with some run to it, thrown typically in the low-90s, a curve with power and depth that he can morph into a slider and a solid changeup.  Command has been an issue for Harris at times, so while he has the stuff to start, he'll have to show he can find the strike zone enough to stick in a rotation.

The White Sox intended on developing him as a starter but moved him to the bullpen in mid-2017 after he stalled in high Class A. He logged a 1.55 ERA during the 2018 regular season and continued to impress in the Arizona Fall League, yet went unclaimed in the Rule 5 Draft after Chicago left him off its 40-man roster.  Thompson has more pitches than most relievers. He throws both low-90s two-seam fastballs with heavy sink and mid-90s four-seamers up in the zone. He also will mix spike curveballs with high-80s cutters, and he'll occasionally dust off a changeup he needed more when he was a starter.  With the exception of Thompson's changeup, each of those pitches can grade as plus on a good day. His deep repertoire and his 6-foot-7 frame combine to keep hitters uncomfortable, though there still are times when his lack of reliable control and command get him in trouble.

Morreale, who moved into the Hoyas rotation as a junior and has two years of relief experience, not to mention pitching out of the 'pen in the Cape Cod League last summer, on his resume, hopes to add to both of those groups of one.  While Morreale has been inconsistent as a starter, he has shown premium arm strength in spurts. He'll often be up to 95 mph early in starts coming from his 6-foot-5 frame, but will drop down to the low-90s as his starts wear on. He throws both a cutter in the upper-80s and a true 83-85 mph slider, though the two pitches often morph into each other. He has a changeup, but it's inconsistent. He has struggled at times with his command, perhaps because of his arm action, but his delivery has not raised any major red flags.  It's possible Morreale's velocity doesn't hold because he doesn't have a long resume as a starter.

Rivas has a polished left-handed bat with a sweet swing that routinely produces line drives. He has a solid approach at the plate with excellent discipline and pitch recognition. There hasn't been much power to date, but there is a little to dream on as he gets more physical and perhaps learns to backspin the ball a bit more, particularly on the pull side. He's a solid defender at first with a strong arm -- he pitched in relief for two years at Arizona -- and can also handle an outfield corner if need be.  For Rivas to profile as an everyday player at first, or even in an outfield corner, his power output will have to tick up.

The Twins liked him enough to take him in the 11th round last June and went above pick value to sign him for $220,000 so he wouldn't go back to the Aggies for his senior year.  Not surprisingly, Helman kept swinging a hot bat during his pro debut, spending much of the summer in the full-season Midwest League and finishing with a .361/.409/.510 line in 39 total games for the summer. He has excellent bat to ball skills from the right side of the plate, using a short, compact swing to make consistent hard contact. He has an advanced approach at the plate, with a willingness to work counts and draw walks and he showed that his sneaky pop will play as a pro.   Second base is the only position Helman fits and while he might never wow anyone there, he should be fine defensively. After his debut, he could get pushed aggressively to see how he reacts.

Pitching in a rotation for his first two full seasons, the right-hander missed bats and walked batters at a very high rate. That was still the case in 2018 with a move to the bullpen and while the command is still an issue, he pitched well enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster this past offseason.  Staumont is now a full-time reliever with the kind of premium stuff to have success in the big leagues if he can find the strike zone a little more consistently. In shorter stints, his fastball can be a true 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, hitting triple digits. His curveball is well above average at times and he actually commands his breaking ball better than his heater. Staumont does have an upper-80s changeup that almost plays like a two-seamer, and will get weak contact at times, but he doesn't commit to it enough.  A lack of fastball command is the only thing holding Staumont back at this point. At the end of last year, he was mixing in his offspeed stuff earlier in counts to open the zone more, and it was better.

He operated mostly as a swingman early in his pro career and had a strong first full season, albeit as a 23-year-old in the Class A South Atlantic League. A move up to Class A Advanced Potomac the next year was met with struggles, and the Nationals shifted him to the bullpen full-time when he repeated the level in 2018. He took quickly to the new role, pitching increasingly well as the season progressed before an eye-opening performance in the Arizona Fall League.   After working in the low 90s during the regular season, Guilbeau's fastball was consistently 95-96 mph with improved late life in the Fall League. He has an above-average slider, thrown in the mid-80s with good depth, and also can mix in a fringy changeup. He has below-average control of all three pitches, though it stands to improve as he becomes more comfortable with his improved stuff out of the bullpen.   Guilbeau dominated same-sided hitters in the Carolina League with his fastball-breaking ball combo, holding them to a .184 average without allowing an extra-base hit in 54 plate appearances.

The Marlins fell into the former camp, signing him for $1.2 million as a second-round choice.  Dunand's most obvious tool is his raw right-handed power, which he creates more with strength than bat speed. He'll have to control the strike zone and make more contact to get the most out of it, however, and he had a 30-percent strikeout rate in Double-A last year. He never has hit for a high average, batting .268 in three years at North Carolina State and .246 in his first two pro seasons, and he walks infrequently.  A fringy runner with a thick lower half, Dunand played exclusively at shortstop in his first two years as a pro but doesn't project to stay there.

Sanchez has had a low-90s fastball (that will touch as high as 95 early in outings) and good lefty curveball since before Anaheim sent him to Atlanta for Kyle Kubitza back in 2015, and that combination drives a perfectly fine lefty relief profile, especially if Sanchez can air it out for an inning at a time and adds a few ticks to his fastball as a result.

The Mariners took a shot and acquired him for cash last November.  Sanchez has teased with his ability as a left-hander with three usable pitches. He'd have some good starts and appear to show progress, then just as quickly regress, watching many of the Braves' pitching prospects pass him by. He'll flash above-average stuff across the board, with a live fastball up to 94 mph, an ability to really spin a breaking ball and a feel for a deceptive changeup. None of it has been consistent, and many reports last year barely had average grades across the board, as evaluators wonder when he'll take ownership and do the things he needs to do to take the next step in his development.  The Mariners are hoping a change of scenery will help him, and being designated will be the wakeup call he needs. Despite all the ups and downs, Sanchez will only be 22 for most of the 2019 season.

But evaluators prefer to come in packages well above six feet tall. When a pitcher like Owens, who is 5-foot-10, can crank it up velocity-wise, the enthusiasm often comes with a bit more caution.  While Owens is undersized, he has compact strength and athleticism on the mound. And he has plenty of arm, consistently firing fastballs up to 94-95 mph this spring. He'll also flash a solid slider that has good short break and he even has some feel for a changeup with some fade, though he doesn't need to use it very often at his current level. Like with many high school pitchers, he's more control over command, though he tends to find the strike zone fairly consistently.  This is where the questions come in. With his size, scouts wonder if Owens will be durable enough to be a starter at the next level. His fastball-breaking ball combination likely would play up in a bullpen role, but high schoolers with reliever profiles are hard to place on a Draft board.

Returning to the FSL in 2018, Soto continued to show big-time arm strength and rack up strikeouts, though the zone evaded him for much of the season.   There's never been any questioning of Soto's pure stuff. His ability to throw strikes, on the other hand, remains suspect. He'll run a lively fastball up to 95-96 mph that misses bats and induces ground-ball contact. His secondary pitchers are still works in progress but all have promise, including a breaking ball that should be Major League average and a fringy, though usable, changeup. Command is still a major issue for Soto, whose walk rate jumped from 4.7 BB/9 in 2017 to 5.6 BB/9 last year.   Blessed with tremendous arm strength, Soto's ultimate role will be determined how far he can come in harnessing it and learning how to pitch.

Houston believes his makeup will help him get the most out of his tools, and he has the highest upside of any middle infielder in the system with the exception of Freudis Nova.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"HOU\"","\"A-\"","38","\"2016 J2 (HOU)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","24","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"40.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","45","30","65","70","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1263","1260","1260","1189","1253","\"38.3\"","\"38.3\"","\"37.9\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"|\"","\"Jake\"","\"Mangum\"","2019","\"23.2\"","\"CF\"","\"S\"","\"L\"","\"73\"","\"185\"","\"draft\"","145","4","\"|\"","2129","","\"mangum_jake\"","","","\"|\"","","\"Mississippi State\"","0","0","","","","35","","","","\"|\"","\"Mississippi State\"","","","","","45","\"<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/2019-draft-jake-mangum-of?t=mlb-draft\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH <img src=\"http://www.mlb.com/images/icons/video.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>    Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 20 | Run: 65 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 45  Mangum comes from a football family -- his grandfather John Sr., father John Jr. and uncle Kris all played professionally -- but has made his name in baseball. He won the Southeastern Conference's batting title (.408) and freshman of the year award in 2016 and has stayed at Mississippi State for four years despite getting drafted by the Yankees in the 30th round as a sophomore and by the Mets in the 32nd round last year. One of the best seniors in the 2019 Draft, he broke Eddy Furniss' SEC career hits record in April with his 353rd.  The scouting report on Mangum has changed little during his college career. A switch-hitter, he has an extreme contact approach that results in a lot of opposite-field singles but few walks and little in the way of power. His best tool is his well above-average speed and he's doing a better job of translating it into stolen bases as a senior.  Mangum also has improved as a center fielder during his time with the Bulldogs, showing better reads and routes instead of just relying on his quickness to track down balls. He has a stronger arm than most at his position and touched 93 mph with his fastball when he started five games on the mound as a sophomore. One scout likened him to a faster version of Sam Fuld.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","\"|\"","954","118","\"NYM\"","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","\"Senior\"","","\"|\"","","","\"40.7\"","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","55","20","65","55","55","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1264","1261","1261","1190","1254","\"38.3\"","\"38.3\"","\"37.9\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"40.7\"","\"|\"","\"Jeremy\"","\"Pena\"","2019","\"21.7\"","\"SS\"","\"R\"","\"R\"","\"72\"","\"179\"","\"professional\"","218","6","\"|\"","2537","665161","\"pena_jeremy\"","","\"sa876320\"","\"|\"","","\"Maine\"","0","0","","\"Med\"","2022","37","\"YRrhsdBsxBo\"","","\"Pena was widely considered to be the best collegiate defensive shortstop in the 2018 draft but despite his picturesque swing, he made very little offensive impact against out-of-conference pitching and with woods bats during the summer.

One of the best defensive shortstops in the 2018 college class, he became the highest-drafted position player in Maine history when the Astros took him in the third round. He earned short-season New York-Penn League All-Star honors in his pro debut but missed the final month with a leg injury.  Pena is the top defender among shortstops in the Houston system. His quick first step and smooth actions give him plenty of range, and he has a plus arm to make all of the necessary throws. His tools will allow him to play anywhere in the infield and serve as a utilityman if he doesn't hit enough to become an everyday player.  Pena makes regular contact to all fields and has a patient approach. He has the strength to do some damage at the plate but has made little offensive impact with wood bats in college summer leagues or as a pro, so the Astros are working with him to try to unlock some power in his right-handed swing.

He posted a statistically impressive season in the DSL, but struggled in his first attempt at rookie ball in the States. Campos is very physically mature for his age, his build that of a high school fullback.

After a very encouraging professional debut in the Dominican Summer League in '17, he was sent to the A's in the Ryon Healy deal that November. He came stateside for the first time to make his A's debut in '18 and struggled in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Campos is an athletic infielder who did keep his defensive profile intact upon his arrival. He's shown the ability to play multiple infield positions with excellent actions and an accurate arm. He might best be suited for second base long-term because he might not have the arm strength for shortstop, though he'll be given every opportunity to grow into the position as he develops in the lower levels of the A's system. His right-handed bat is still a work in progress. Campos showed an advanced approach in the DSL with the Mariners, drawing more walks than strikeouts, but his K rate spiked in his first go-round in the U.S.  There's still a lot to like with Campos, who will play all of 2019 at age 19.

Meyer is an accomplished defender, with a plus arm and at least above average defensive ability. He has some pop (45 raw power, game power below that) and is a solid athlete, but there isn't much impact with the bat. He leans more contact-oriented in his approach, but often won't make consistent hard contact, with some timing, pitch recognition, and plate coverage shortcomings at present.

The Mets took him in the sixth round that June, signing him for $350,000. After a pro debut spent in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League, Meyer made the jump straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League for his first full season.   Meyer has excellent hands and moves well behind the plate, allowing him to receive and block well. He has a strong and accurate arm, recording excellent pop times to second base on a consistent basis. Offensively, the right-handed hitter makes consistent contact but offers little in the way of power. He rarely strikes out and has decent on-base skills that help prop up his overall offensive value.   Meyer likely profiles as a backup at the next level, though he could become a defensive-minded regular if his bat comes around.

He and Bryant Packard have formed a two-man wrecking crew for East Carolina for the last three seasons. The 2018 Cape Cod League all-star game MVP, he has more power but less pure hitting ability and defensive value than Packard and should join him in the top five rounds this June.  Brickhouse's carrying tool is huge raw left-handed power to all fields, the product of strength and leverage more than bat speed. He has reached double figures in homers in each of his three college seasons, and he's willing to take walks when pitchers decline to challenge him. He has some feel for hitting, but his dead-pull approach and struggles with wood bats on the Cape create some swing-and-miss concerns.  Most scouts project Brickhouse as a DH in pro ball. He's a bottom-of-the-scale runner with well below-average arm strength and shaky defense at first base.

He hit just .222/.313/.290 in his first two seasons in Oxford, and his lack of offensive production relegated him to backup duty between 2018 Marlins fourth-rounder Nick Fortes. He has shown significant improvement as a hitter and receiver this spring, putting him in position to get selected in the same range as Fortes.    Any discussion of Johnson still starts with his arm, a well above-average cannon that regularly registers sub-1.9-second pop times and helped him erase 45 percent of basestealers during the 2019 regular season. He has worked hard to improve his receiving and blocking, which had been subpar in the past but now elicit average to solid grades. His overall defensive game is good enough to project him as at least a big league backup.    While scouts still aren't sold that Johnson will hit enough to be a regular in the Majors, he has gotten better. He has a more selective approach, is putting together more competitive at-bats and is making better contact.

In 2018, Chirinos played mostly shortstop, with a few games at second base, but behind the scenes, the Yankees have worked him out at every position on the field and think there's a real chance he could move behind the plate and profile as an everday guy back there. He has an easy plus arm and what some club officials call 80 makeup to go with 50-grade raw power and speed. Most amateur scouts didn't have questions on Chirinos' bat, so they expect that to come around to 50 or better in time. There's a chance, given this makeup and tools profile, that Chirinos could work his way into the new archetype of a multi-positional catcher utilityman (think Austin Barnes, Will Smith, Kyle Farmer, Connor Wong, Isaiah Kiner-Falefa, Josh Morgan, or Garrett Stubbs) who has become fashionable as progressive clubs look to have more flexibility in the lineup decision-making.\"","\"|\"","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","\"NYY\"","\"R\"","39","\"2017 J2 (NYY)\"","\"|\"","","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","\"|\"","","","","","","","","","","",""],["1376","1373","1350","1333","1357","\"37.0\"","\"37.0\"","\"37.0\"","","","","\"|\"","\"Ronny\"","\"Rojas\"","2019","\"17.8\"","\"2B\"","\"S\"","\"R\"","\"73\"","\"180\"","\"professional\"","148","4","\"|\"","1949","","","","\"sa3005530\"","\"|\"","","\"Dominican Republic\"","0","0","","\"High\"","2022","37","","","\"So young was Rojas compared to his July 2 peer group that he had to wait until he had turned 16 a few months after the signing period began to finalize a $1 million agreement with the Yankees.

assume Correa was hurt for much of 2018 (he threw just two AZL innings) but it's unclear what ailed him. In 2017, he had some wild fluctuations in velocity (he was seen throwing anywhere between 93 and 100, but mostly sitting 94-98), which continued when he threw in 2018. Correa was 94-96 in the spring and then didn't pitch until late in the summer when he was 92-93.
