# Tables

Where I store a variety of tables in a somewhat pretty format. If you want to view a table in particular, go to [http://connor-r.github.io/Tables/*file_name*.html](http://connor-r.github.io/Tables/*file_name*.html) (e.g., in the off chance somebody was interested in things that I've read or sites that I frequently visit, you would go to [http://connor-r.github.io/Tables/cr_bookmarks.html](http://connor-r.github.io/Tables/cr_bookmarks.html))
