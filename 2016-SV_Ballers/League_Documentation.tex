\Ss{2015 Review and 2016 Preview}
First, let's turn our heads back and recall our stupid inaugural season. Our heavily disliked league champion Matt Abraham scored the 7th most points during the regular season, then backed his way into a championship matchup with supreme leader, heavy favorite, noted stateman, and all-around good human person Kyle McNulty, only to pull a shocking upset thanks to a pair of huge performances by a possible android (Frank Gore) and a possible elf (Blair Walsh). If we were to believe the performance in week 16 was truly the best way to decide a league champion, then the logical place to start would be to look to the high scorer of that week, Team Kirkshire Mang All Day FC, who essentially tied for the worst non-Mitch team of the 2015 season. One could even argue that the person he tied for the spot (Fat Tyler Edwards) shouldn't be judged on the same ground, seeing as he suffers from severe down syndrome. Nevertheless, none of this matters, as a singular season of fantasy football managing doesn't serve as a great predictor for success this season, which is what we all care about, well at least until FANTASY FUCKING HOCKEY starts up!
\\[5mm] Also big shoutout to Casey. I guess he won Fantasy Baseball. Who even knew we were in a league?


\Ss{Draft Review}
Our draft was held on the eve of the 5 September in the year of our Lloyd 2016. 6 members congregated at League Master's house \{Casey, Kyle, Sean, Matt, James, Connor\}, 3 members circle-jerked (or triangle-jerked?) themselves somewhere in Buttfuck Nowhere, CA \{Tyler, Greg, Trevor\}, Donovan used some terrible excuse to sit on his thumbs in Watsonville, while Kevin ``Holocaust'' Mangan single-handedly fought off a hurricane in Florida, and Danny took notes to become a lawyer so he can help the rest of us out after Trevor arrests us for murdering his ass too hard in fantasy.

\SSs{Top 5 Best Picks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Brandon Marshall -- Pick 2.7 (19) -- Wu Tang Liquidation}
\\B-Marsh checks all the boxes. Size? $\checkmark$ Targets? $\checkmark$ End-zone targets? $\checkmark$ QB trust? $\checkmark$ Strong secondary receiver? $\checkmark$ So getting him as the 9th overall WR was great for Tyler, especially after Tyler took a major risk with his 1st round selection.

\item \textbf{Andrew Luck \& Carson Palmer -- Picks 6.6 (66) \& 8.6 (90) -- Fantastic Men}
\\Even though quarterback generally isn't that volatile of a position, Danny still decided to grab two guys who could finish in the top-5 at the position. So why isn't this a bad decision? Because he didn't have to reach for either (Luck was the 6th QB taken, Palmer the 9th). Both play in very advantageous offense systems with aggressive coaches, both have a plethora of receiving targets they can distribute the ball to, and both at one point were on Wu Tang Financial last season. That's a good list.

\item \textbf{Martellus Bennett - Pick 13.12 (156) -- A Grizzly Bear}
\\Marty B is gonna wreck shit up this year next to Gronk. Both are gonna have over 180 catches, over 2000 yards, and over 30 TDs. Mark it down in your copybooks now.

\item \textbf{Eddie Lacy \& Sammy Watkins -- Picks 2.11 (23) \& Pick 3.2 (26) -- Kill or Be killed}
\\Dono crushed the early stage of the draft before slipping in the later rounds. Sammy Watkins is one of the most physically gifted receivers in the league (remember, Watkins was the first WR taken in a draft the also featured OBJ, Mike Evans, Allen Robinson, and Brandin Cooks). He's the only non-RB target Tyrod Taylor has that puts any fear into an opposing defense, and his deep ball skills play well with Taylor's scramble-and-huck skillset. Eddie Lacy is fat. But he's also a very strong runner, in a potent offense, and as long as he can stay out of the doghouse, should see quite a few opportunities at the goal line. If he can push James Starks out of the receiving RB spot in the Packers scheme, he could be the steal of the draft.
 
\item \textbf{James White -- Pick 13.8 (152) -- GREGADELPHIA GREG'S}
\\White's not going to fully replace Dion Lewis, as he's not in the same stratus in terms of rushing ability. But the Patriots love to throw to their backs, and White is easily the best pass-catcher amongst their current ensemble. He's could catch 40 balls before Lewis returns, and if he peppers in a few rushing yards here and there, that can play as a 3rd RB, not bad value in the 13th round.

\end{enumerate}

\SSs{Top 5 Worst Picks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lamar Miller -- Pick 1.6 (6) -- Wu Tang Liquidation}
\\He could be worth this slot, but he's also never shown anything close to 1st round production over a full season. There usually isn't a bad 1st round pick, since the floor of most top players is just a really-really good player (assuming no injuries). Miller is kind of the counter-case to that argument as an unusual boom or bust selection in the first half-dozen picks. On the bright side, he's finally out of a Miami situation that didn't want to use his diverse skillset, he's only 25, and his new situation in Houston is one that should result in a huge touch count.

\item \textbf{Stephen Gostkowski -- Pick 8.3 (87) -- Hot Fuzz}
\\I love kickers. In a true football sense, they're terribly underrated. The points-added by a great kicker over a bad kicker is bigger than you'd think, and the position as a whole has seen an insane development over our lifetimes. That said, this is too early for a kicker. And Gostkowski isn't the best kicker in the league (Justin Tucker is). He may be the best fantasy kicker since the Pats are gonna score 90 points every game, but still, too early. Like way too early. 

\item \textbf{Thomas Rawls -- PIck 3.1 (25) -- Casetrain Don't Stop}
\\IT'S CHRISTINE MICHAEL TIME. Seriously though, this pick wouldn't be half bad if Casey managed to grab Michael later on in the draft. Any RB who is slated to see touches in the SEA system is going to put up yards, partially due to the way defenses have to prepare for Russell Wilson's scrambling. I worry that if Rawls isn't healthy enough to seize the position in the first couple of weeks, Michael may perform well enough to make the situation murky.

\item \textbf{Aaron Rodgers -- Pick 3.12 (36) -- A Grizzly Bear}
\\Truth be told, I was a little pre-occupied creating FANTASY HOCKEY and didn't realize it was my turn to pick. Still, no excuses. I do like Rodgers as the best QB in the league, and getting Jordy Nelson back should help a lot, but there are a lot of good QB this year, and many would have been available later, when the value would be better.

\item \textbf{Seahawks D/ST - Pick 9.9 (105) -- Tallanastee Trainstoppers}
\\This pick isn't as egregious as the Gostkowski selection, but it still was a bit early for my liking, and the DEN defense will likely finish above them this year. Best front-7,  and a top-3 secondary? Playing at Denver is going to be death on opposing teams.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\Ss{Pre-season Preview}
\SSs{Preview: Pick 1 - Casey Mangan - Casetrain Don't Stop}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Tyrod Taylor [10.12 (120)]
\item Worst Pick: Thomas Rawls [3.1 (25)]
\end{itemize}
Casey semeed to alternate between picks I loved, and picks I hated. Probably since he was getting half his info from Matt, and half from Lloyd. Tyrod Taylor is a personal favorite, getting Tom Brady before Dono was good value, and I'm a big fan of DeAndre Washington, especially once Latavius Murray has his inevitable concussion. Danny Woodhead should be extremely valuable in this format, and Mike Evans could be poised for an even bigger breakout.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 2 - Donovan Sheridan - Kill or Be Killed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Sammy Watkins [3.2 (26)]
\item Worst Pick: Latavius Murray [4.11 (47)]
\end{itemize}
As previous mentioned, Donovan had a really good start to the draft, grabbing 2 dynamic WR, a top QB, and a top RB. The rest of his draft wasn't quite up to the same level, starting with Latavius Murray. I don't know if there was a RB I was ever so sure would get a concussion, he really took the phrase ``attack head on'' to heart. That said, DeVante Parker has great upside late in the draft, and Dono did well to grab the pass-catching half of the Green Bay backfield in case of Eddie Lacy eating his way out of the starting job.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 3 - Kyle McNulty - The Great Cornjulio}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Odell Beckham Jr. [1.3 (3)]
\item Worst Pick: Dwayne Allen [12.10 (142)]
\end{itemize}
Kyle needed a TE late in the draft. He didn't take Marty B. That won't end well. In all seriousness, the best team from 2015, looks equally deep this year, with intriguing names up and down the roster. It may not have the star power of last year, but I'm sure after a few weeks and some shrewd moves, The Great CornOBJ will be near the top of the league leaderboard.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 4 - Sean Musser - Lloyds' Loids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Amari Cooper [2.9 (21)]
\item Worst Pick: Kirk Cousins [10.9 (117)]
\end{itemize}
This team will finish the year 12-0, but having only scored 500 points. Lloyd will overthink every decision, trade Todd Gurley for nothing after a bad game, bench Amari Cooper because he does well against the Dolphins, and then finish 4th in the postseason. Nobody will be surprised. Except Jarvis Landy, who will be confused about what the playoffs are.

\newpage
\SSs{Preview: Pick 5 - Matt Abraham - Connor's Catz: Lump and Tux}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Michael Crabtree [7.5 (77)]
\item Worst Pick: Vance McDonald [15.5 (173)]
\end{itemize}
The team with the best icon in the league is littered with question-marks. Who is their TE? Will Matthew Stafford survive without Megatron? Will Demaryius Thomas survive without Peyton? Will Jamaal Charles heal? This is a true boom or bust team, just as likely to be in the top-3 as in the league cellar. That's not surprising, as Matt has been the definition of polarity, finishing first in 2015-football, and last in 2016-baseball. Hey, at least it matches his personality.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 6 - Tyler Edwards - Wu Tang Liquidation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Brandon Marshall [2.7 (13)]
\item Worst Pick: Lamar Miller [1.6 (6)]
\end{itemize}
Tyler probably has the best 4th WR in the league. Unfortunately, that isn't going to help him unless he sees an injury to one of his starters. While it's never smart to bank on perfect health, it's a little overcautious to assume an injury at a given position. I don't see a matchup where Brown plays over Edelman/Jeffery/Marshall if the latter three are healthy. That said, Tyler's starting lineup can match up with most of the league, he has a couple of high upside bench pieces, and a pair of cute little cheeks that everybody loves to squeeze. I just worry about his lack of RB depth behind a pair of volatile starters.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 7 - Danny Noonan - Fantastic Men}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Carson Palmer [8.6 (90)]
\item Worst Pick: Jonathan Stewart [3.7 (31)]
\end{itemize}
Our eldest statesman, Sir Danny of Sydnelrod has created a team that has one attribute lacking in every other team in the league; none of his players hail from their owner's home country. That's wild! In addition to that fascinating tidbit, Danny also pieced together a solid roster, heavily reliant on his favorite team's best two players. Honestly, I'm surprised Danny didn't splurge and use his last two picks on Tony Romo and Dak Prescott. If everything goes well, this team could be scary good, with 2 top QB, 2 top WR, potentially 3 top RB, and who knows, maybe Antonio Gates will say ``fuck-off'' to his archnemesis Father Time for the 70th year in a row and he'll have a top TE! Add in a surprising Raiders D/ST, this is a team that could go hard in the paint come playoff time.

\newpage
\SSs{Preview: Pick 8 - Greg Ebert - GREGADELPHIA GREG'S}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: James White [13.8 (152)]
\item Worst Pick: Blake Bortles [8.5 (89)]
\end{itemize}
Greg has a the strangest bench in the league, that's for sure; I think the player I'm most comfortable projecting would be James White. I'm also not sure what to make of Blake Bortles at this point. He's clearly talented, but may have been a reach in the 8th, especially over the string of Palmer/Rivers/Manning that followed. But Greg has his boyz, and apparently Bruce Ellington is one of them! He also has my favorite non-Gronk TE in Walker, a pair of great RB, and the best D in the league. So that's fun. Hooray Greg!

\SSs{Preview: Pick 9 - Kevin Mangan - Tallanastee Trainstoppers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: DeAndre Hopkins [1.9 (9)]
\item Worst Pick: Seahawks D/ST [9.9 (105)]
\end{itemize}
True Story, DeAndre Hopkins was the \#4 player on my board. Kevin did a great job snagging him at \#9. The rest of his draft was more along the ``meh'' lines for me. I don't hate any of the picks individually (aside from the early D/ST), but it seemed like every selection was 9 or 10 picks above where I would have taken the player. Still, as has become a theme, if things break right, and if the team stays healthy, Kevin could potentially tie his baby brother in Fantasy Championships Won (March Madness doesn't count, Kevin).

\SSs{Preview: Pick 10 - Trevor Carney - Hot Fuzz}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: Rob Gronkowski [1.10 (10)]
\item Worst Pick: Stephen Gostkowski [8.3 (87)]
\end{itemize}
Remember when I said Greg had the strangest bench in the league? Yeah, he doesn't. Trevor does, and it's not particularly close. Looking it over I'm not sure if Trevor is a huge college football fan, or an old-timey NFL fan from the mid aughts. He put together a unique combination of three rookie WR, a rookie RB, and maybe the oldest RB/TE combination imaginable. Fun fact, the combined age of Sproles/Witten is more than that of Thomas/Coleman/Rogers/Bookers. Don't bother checking that, I know I'm right. Similar to Kevin's squad, Trevor took a lot of guys I liked, but also took them a round or two higher than I would have, resulting in a lack of high end talent past Gronk, Nelson, and Dougy B.

\newpage
\SSs{Preview: Pick 11 - James McKenna - Hit Squad}
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: \sout{Boobie Dixon [15.11 (179)]} Willie Snead [9.11$^\text{never forget}$ (107)] 
\item Worst Pick: Jordan Reed [3.11 (35)]
\end{itemize}
This team is amazing. Probably because it was built using a bunch of SUPER USEFUL information from the genius owner of \textit{A Grizzly Bear}. Ignoring the RB position, this team is insanely good. Unfortunately for James, RB is a pretty important position and he boasts the weakest group in the league. He does have a couple of boom-or-bust backs on his bench who could potentially solidify the position, but waiting until R5 to take your RB1 is a risky strategy. If James can strike gold and find a couple of waiver RB who can produce mid-league production for the position, this team could very well win the 'ship, all of the surrounding pieces are in place.

\SSs{Preview: Pick 12 - Connor Reed - A Grizzly Bear} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Best Pick: All 15 picks were perfect, but the best was \dots Martellus Bennett [13.12 (156)]
\item Worst Pick: Hard to have a bad pick when you nailed all of them, but \dots Aaron Rodgers [3.12 (36)]
\end{itemize}
For those wondering, I wanted Jamaal Charles and Tom Brady too. If my strategy wasn't made implicitly clear last year, I'll spell it out here. I like punting early weeks in exchange for a dominant team towards the end of the season. Last year the injury bugs kept biting me at inopportune times, as well as some inverse Lloyd luck when it came to matchups. This year I'm hoping for better results. With Josh Gordon and Le'Veon Bell out the first 4/3 weeks, I'm hoping for a 2-2 start before initializing my destruction over the rest of your sickly teams. Also, every player on my team is going to have a career season and I'm going to moonwalk into the championship, only to win on a 99 yard Martellus Bennett TD rush (he's converting to RB by week 3, just watch).

{Week 1 Review - The Lloyd Roast}}
Well it's that time of the year everyone. Week 1 is over and let the freak-out commence. AP, Dez, and Gurley leave on bust train while Hyde, Williams, Willie Snead take off on the boom train. I was so eager to play fantasy football for about 8 months and now that week 1 is over I've remembered why I hate fantasy football and never want to play again. Except for next week.

\SSs{\href{http://games.espn.com/ffl/boxscorefull?leagueId=1016777&teamId=8&scoringPeriodId=1&seasonId=2016&view=scoringperiod&version=full}
{James vs. Trevor}}
\par\noindent Well well well\dots looks like the new guy came to play week 1. Can't play with the big guys yet but he could probably tussle with Lloyd. What seemed like a mismatched codswallop of a team put up a solid 111 points. Trevor was carried by Drew Brees and his stat-chasing arm and a late TD for Doug Baldwin helped as well. Remember when we all gave Kevin shit for drafting Jason Witten in like the 4th round? Well good job Trevor for drafting Jason Witten so early!! Looks like him and Dak are BFFs out there and Witten saw a massive amount of targets. Nelson didn't tear his ACL, which is a plus, and Gostkowski was Gostkowski. Unfortunately Trevor is going to have a big problem all year\dots figuring out when Gio is gonna catch 10 passes or when Hill is going to take over. Have fun with that one, I know Tyler wanted to get off of that wild ride all last year.
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.4\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure} 
\bigskip
\par\noindent BADA BING BADA \LARGE BOOOOOM! \normalsize James was on fire and made some solid lineup choices. Newton put up a solid 20+ against the strong Denver D, A-Rob was decent, Reed was decent, Mathews and the Eagles were a nice surprise. And then there's some A.J. Green guy who has never been under 1000 yards in a season and while he is a bit boom-or-bust sometimes no one catches fire like A.J. Green. Pretty sure AJ was channeling his inner Jimmy Buffet on Revis Island cuz it looked like A.J. was in paradise. James also capitalized on the Raiders/NO shootout and added 30 with Willie Snead. Melvin Gordon looked like a stud fighting for extra yardage and Yeldon/Mike Wallace put up some good numbers as well. James looks to have some good options lying on the bench and should be a contender this year. No longer a fantasy rookie, James is looking like a contender to make the playoffs in his sophomore season. 

\newpage
\SSs{\href{http://games.espn.com/ffl/boxscorefull?leagueId=1016777&teamId=5&scoringPeriodId=1&seasonId=2016&view=scoringperiod&version=full}
{Danny vs. Lloyd}}
\par\noindent Carlos Hyde $>$ Todd Gurley = Fact. Danny was down 20 points with Carlos Hyde left while Sean had Gurley left\dots and we all now the ending to that story. Carlos Hyde is one fantastic man. Danny was lifted by Andrew Luck who looks to have returned to his 2015 form with 35 points. While many of us draft trying to choose the best fantasy prospect, Danny does enjoy having people from his favorite team. Zeke is still working out the kinks but should continue to pick up steam. The rest of Danny's team was well\dots pretty bad. Gates was an afterthought on the Chargers, Stewart didn't get much running room against Denver, and the Raiders stole points from Danny after having 34 points scored on them. The real savior of Danny's team though was DEZ BRYANT!! Without that one 8 yd catch Danny would have lost to Lloyd! Honorable mention goes to Carlos Hyde for 22.3 points off of 2 TDs. While Danny snuck out a win he is going to need some shrewd start/sit decisions to make sure his team is scoring 100+ week in week out. However Gates’ stock is on the rise with Keenan getting injured and Dez can only get better so don't discount Danny from being an underdog for the playoffs.
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.4\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.325\textwidth]{week1-lloyd.png}
\label{fig:week1-lloyd}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\bigskip
\par\noindent Well Lloyd got roasted so let me add some insult to injury. September 12, 2016 will forever be remembered as the day our entire league roasted Sean ``Lloyd'' Musser. With no regard to race, decency, or any other good human qualities. Probably the craziest stat of the week. If Sean started his \textit{ENTIRE BENCH}, 2RB, 3WR, 1TE (\textcolor{red}{\textbf{NO QB, DST, K}}) he would have beat Danny by 2.2 points. I know we always say the Lloyd works in mysterious ways but that's just plain idiotic. Lloyd has clearly been talking with Connor much because not only did his bench outscore his starters he also had a player score ZERO points, which if we recall happened to Connor weeks 1-4 last year. While Lloyd deserves to be roasted significantly, and has, I'd say he has the best reason to be excited about week 1. Spencer Ware is an elite RB1 for as long as Charles is out, Landry looked involved in the offense, and while I thought Cooper was a reach he looks to be in good rapport with Carr. Not only that, but Lloyd has depth for days. Forte, Foster, Matthews, Fuller, Ebron, Hogan all put up double digit points. Hopefully the Rams figure out how to better utilize Gurley but if that doesn't happen Lloyd has the RB depth to offset that loss. Lloyd will only get better as the season goes on and injuries plague other teams. Clearly Sean had a solid draft and as long as he has better luck we should start seeing him in the win column.

\newpage
\SSs{\href{http://games.espn.com/ffl/boxscorefull?leagueId=1016777&teamId=2&scoringPeriodId=1&seasonId=2016&view=scoringperiod&version=full}
{Tyler vs. Matt}}
\bigskip\par\noindent My vote for the best smack board by far. Matt really pulled out the stingers due to some past history. 
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.52\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{week1-tyler.png}
\text{\textbf{Bold words Tyler\dots}}
\label{fig:week1-tyler}
\end{wrapfigure} \par\noindent I personally thought Tyler had one of the best drafts but looks like I was wrong for week 1. Tyler had decent numbers but was let down by Marshall, Fleener, and John Brown. Marshall climbed from round 5/6 last year to round 2 and Tyler better hope that Marshall turns his shit around and Fitzmagic connects better with him. Tyler has a weird mancrush on Rivers, drafting him again, and clearly his tendencies towards older men had him play Rivers over Winston. In a game where the Chargers had 27 points Rivers only had 15 fantasy points. That's only a couple more points than Rivers has kids!! Not what you're looking for. Edelman still has value with Brady out, but Tyler needs to get some more help from his role players. However Tyler has an elite RB core of Miller and CJ, both of whom are going to get a ton of touches this year. Even if they're absolutely terrible, if you're getting 20+ touches a game you're gonna put up 8 points minimum and I expect his RB core to provide the best floor of most duos.
\bigskip 
\par\noindent Matt's team is kind of like Trevor's team, but worse. At least with Trevor's team you've heard of them, they're just old. But for every stud in Matt's lineup there's also a backup or someone you haven't heard of. However, both teams scored a decent amount of points this week. Vance McDonald, Charles Sims, and Marvin Jones are all starting in Matt's lineup. However Matt seemed to pick the needles from the haystack for week 1 and these replacements put up some solid numbers. Based on week 1, Matt seems to have gotten a steal taking David Johnson over AP or Gurley. Surprise of the week goes to Matthew Stafford who put up 26 points! After a terrible season last year that's a nice bounce back and a bold QB choice that worked out well. While Matt did well this week I'd be surprised if this can last. His WR core is pretty lacking and DT is hit or miss due to a hip issue. Jamaalocaust is still on the bench and when he comes back is up in the ``Ware''.  Matt had a solid week 1 but if he's relying on old McDonald's farm to put up 30+ points a week he's going to have a bad time. Don't be surprised if Matt's team has a collapse due to a key injury later in the season. Matt's team has got the upside to go the distance, but also the variation to be down in the dumps.

{Connor vs. Kevin}}
\par\noindent What-if is the question Kevin will be asking this week. What if he played Derek Carr over Russel Wilson? Well he would have beaten Connor that's what. Kevin's team actually performed very well and they were all very consistent. They just didn't have a kick…. They must be taking notes from Kevin's running style. Dougie M., Hopkins, Kelce, and the Seahawks all did pretty well. Brock Lobster seems to have trust with Hopkins and he had 8 targets and a TD. If Fuller emerges that could help draw some coverage off of Hopkins but what if it steals his targets instead? Regardless Hopkins was a good draft choice as the guy has 2 nets for arms. The letdown of Kevin's team was TY Hilton. On a day where Luck threw for 385 yds and 4TDs, TY only got 11 points. Kevin's team is looking solid so far but if he's going to compete for playoffs he's going to need his studs to put up some bigger numbers.

\par\noindent Connor needed 20 points from D-Will for the win and got 32.1 instead. I'd say he owes D-Will a heartfelt tweet. Connor is the creator or the unique strategy of leaving his highest scoring players on his bench, which Lloyd tried to mimic. Lloyd is silly for thinking he can do it better than Connor and he lost as a result of his arrogance. However nearly all Connor's bench players outscored his starters just like last year. I'm not really sure if it's stupidity anymore or a strategy to get more trade value out of people for his sweet trade offers. Maybe it's an attempt to lull his opponents into thinking they have an easy win and not focusing on their matchups…. I really have no idea. He's still the smartest person in our group, and had the time to make a program to push our recaps to the web and write all our draft picks down and document our entire season yet he cannot ever play something remotely resembling an optimal lineup. He's the most polarizing idiotic genius I've ever met. Freeman seems to be splitting with Coleman which isn’'t good for Connor's \#2 pick. However taking the early win really helps Connor's strategy of 2-2 start before the studs start rolling in. If Connor can secure another win next week I'd be worried of a storm brewing that thunder him right into the playoffs. Also Marty B sucks.

{Donovan vs. Greg}}
\par\noindent Greg's fantasy picture is very relevant considering he scored the lowest points of anyone week 1. Live by the Bort, die by the Bort was Greg's motto last year. Neither was really true this game unless ``mediocre by the Bort'' is a thing. With Greg's star QB having a pedestrian performance it was up to AP, Ingram, and Delanie Walker to carry the team. Unfortunately for Greg they carried the team the wrong direction: underground. So far underground that a 30pt performance from Cooks couldn't even salvage him. So far underground that a hipster named Otto couldn't even find Greg's team. Speaking of underground, below Greg's starting roster there was this guy named Kelvin Benjamin who scored more points than AP, Ingram, and Walker combined. Greg was so worried about the Denver D/ST that he tried to figure out the Pats RB situation over playing Kelvin Benjamin. Realistically Greg should be fine. His roster has consistent players like Ingram, Decker, and AP but will need his other spots to perform if he wants to win some games. His team resembles last year's team quite a bit\dots and we all know where that got him. Don't yet discount your current sacko for the championship run just be sure to ridicule him temporarily.

\par\noindent Dono decided to take Julio Jones away from me so he's pretty much a bitch. He also picked up Fat Eddie and Big Ben again both of whom did well for him. When I say Fat Eddie did well I mean he scored more than 3 points which was about his average last year. Whoever is throwing to Antonio Brown generally is going to have some pretty solid numbers week in week out and Roethlisberger should be a pretty consistent QB option. Julio was having a quiet game until the second half where Matty Ice decided to look for one of the best receivers in the league. Dono's team is clicking early in the season and if he can get enough wins under his belt before Eifert comes back he'll have a very formidable team. Also, Larry Fitzgerald I'm convinced is a terminator. He was insane against the patriots and the only reason the Cardinals had any sort of offense. If Fitz keeps that up Dono could have an elite WR core if Watkins can stay healthy. While I've only had good things to say about Dono so far don't be fooled. We all know he's a choker. Game 3 of basketball he chokes. End of last season he choked. We'll have to wait a few weeks to see what version of Dono we get this year but for now he's moving up in the standings.

{Casey vs. Kyle}}
\par\noindent You know that feeling you get when you get a 99\% on an exam and are really stoked? And the girl behind you sees your test and says ``Hey good job!'' You turn around and begin to say thanks and then realize it's Kayla Germany holding up her test that she got a 100\% on and flipping you off? That's pretty much how Kyle must have felt about Casey beating him. Kyle's team was off to an excellent start with most of his studs putting up double digit points. Keenan Allen looked awesome with 7 points just in the first quarter until an unfortunate text from Matt kindly alerted him that his 3rd round pick was now mostly likely out for the season. Aside from that Kyle's team performed admirably, although under the shadow, of the Casetrain. His RB core both got workhorse usage and OBJ put up 10 points even with the Cowboys hogging the clock. If a mix of DJax, Benjamin, and Sanu can pick up some slack from Keenan Allen he might be a solid contender. The 49ers destroyed the Rams, but let's be honest there was no chance in hell the Rams D/ST were going to outscore AB even against the 49ers. Nonetheless the injury definitely knocks him down many spots from the initial draft rankings and a team that was a strong playoff contender after the draft loses a key piece and begins it's slow demise.

\bigskip
\par\noindent Casey is like a giant Chimera train. A three headed, steam rolling, diesel chugging monster of knowledge from Kyle, Matt, and Sean combined. However the real reason Casey's team is so good\dots is because Connor was busy making his Fantasy Hockey league and was unable to give Casey advice. As a result Casey had his starters perform incredibly and no one on his bench outscored their respective positions. TyGOD Taylor looked like garbage against a shaky Baltimore team but that was the end of the Casetrain's problems. Not only did his studs go off but Danny Woodhead now has an incredible opportunity in front of him with the Keenan Allen injury.  And to add insult to injury Casey's defense scored 21.2 points. There's pretty much no winning when the opposing defense scores 20+. The only knock on Casey's team is that he spent a high draft pick on Rawls but doesn't have Michael. However it looks like Rawls should see more work each week but you never know. Heading into MNF, Casey was down by a handful of points with Antonio McCringleberry to play. Three thrusts later, Casey skyrockets past Kyle and into the number one spot for playoff contention. The rest of the league is praying to the fantasy gods for the Casetrain to have engine problems before he makes their stop. CCHOOO CHOOOO MOTHERFUCKER!

{Kevin vs. James}}
\par\noindent It looks like the Hit Squad is living up to its name. Cam Newton had 24 completions and coincidentally 24 fantasy players NOT on James' team were suddenly eliminated. It looks like the Hit Squad has been ``taking care'' of the opposition rather efficiently. Don't get on the bad side of this 2-0 team or you might be next on Goofy's hit list. Cam Newton led the charge with 30 points. Many of us waited to take QBs until later rounds hoping to value. James bucked that trend and it looks to be paying off as Cam has been fulfilling his high price tag. A.J. Green put up a stinker, crashing back down to earth, but that was no matter because Justin Tucker booted James' team right back to the top of the standings. Ryan Mathews was a risky start that panned out and Willie Snead continues to reap the benefits of Drew Brees. A-Rob seems to be struggling a little but having a struggling A-Rob as your WR2 is a good problem to have. I'm not sure why James keeps sitting Melvin Gordon but I applaud him for sticking to his guns. You should continue to do that as I hear Dexter McCluster is going to steal a lot of his carries.

\par\noindent Kevin had no chance after Muscle Hamster pulled his hamstring while playing softball on the sideline. T.Y. Hilton continues to struggle even with good targets and Jeremy Hill had the game script run away from him on Gio's shoulders. Kelce is a big name at TE but is still isn't being fully utilized by the KC offense. Kevin doesn't have much bench depth to fall back on and his starters need to turn it around quickly before he digs himself too big a hole. On the plus side Derek Carr has been a fantasy machine and Nuk is still atomizing corners at will. The injury to Donte Moncreif ups Dorsett's value and Kevin has a high upside WR on his bench right now. There's been good performances from many players on Kevin's team they just haven't come on the same night. If he can get his guys to play better as a team and score a few TDs on the same day he shouldn't have a problem getting out of his 0-2 hole (editor's note: I believe an 0-2 hole should be henceforth known as ``the butthole'').

{Kyle vs. Connor}}
\par\noindent Going into MNF Connor needed about 20 points from Aaron Rodgers, Diggs, and Cobb to beat me. I knew I had it the win in the bag. Somehow those 3 scrubs combined for 50 points and I am absolutely outraged. My team played like they wanted to send a message to Connor. A message at how incredibly afraid of the endzone they are. Eli really took leadership in this message and threw for 300+ yards without throwing a single TD. OBJ also got in on the action and dropped 2 easy touchdown passes. The rest of my loyal team followed suit except for Michael Floyd who scored a touchdown!! However that was his only catch and he was exiled from the rest of the game. It was a quality Sunday from my team and I'm proud of Dan Bailey for outscoring half my team. I stuck to my guns just like James and left my TD machines, Crowell and Travis Benjamin, on my bench. If you stick to your guns long enough it eventually pays off. Whether that's in the form of winning the Sacko or winning the championship is yet to be seen but one thing I can guarantee is that Eli will have more turnovers than I have wins by the end of the season. You can bet your bottoms.

\par\noindent Connor is now 2-0 with a couple of potheads sitting on his bench. Unfortunately these potheads are pretty high on the fantasy rankings and he is in a great spot right now. DeAngelo Williams is the human embodiment of the Casetrain getting 32 opportunities to roll right over Kyle's team. DIGGS OUT FOR HARAMBE GUYS! Dude put on a show against Green Bay and torched them for 28.7 points. His touchdown celebration was also pretty incredible. The NFL is hounding Aaron Rodgers for playing poorly as of late but he still put up 17.4 points. Connor unfortunately lost Abdullah to the injury outbreak, but LeVeon Bell coming back soon should quickly be able to fill this void. Connor's team is being aided by the schedule quite a bit, as last week and this week about 2/3 of other teams would have beat him but alas A Grizzly Bear trudges on. I would like to point out that Connor talks a big game but refuses to back up his own words. I have heard so much about how Marty B is the GOAT but Connor refuses to play him even when he puts up 20 points. Until Marty B sees the starting lineup Connor will continue to lose credibility and I will consider a holdout of fantasy hockey.

\par\noindent look at Matt's team photo because it's hilariously cringe-worthy. Old McDonald's Farm scored 2nd or 3rd highest this week riding the combined efforts of David Johnson, Marvin Jones, Benjamin, and the Texans Defense. Also a huge surprise was Jacob Tamme putting up 16 points at the TE position. Nearly everyone on Matt's team put up double digit points and he put all the right people on the bench. Studs gave stud performances and he did everything right. Unfortunately he still lost to Lloyd, the highest scoring team this week. But as Ron White would say, you can't fix stupid. And in Matt's case he can do everything right but he'll still lose because he's just inherently bad at fantasy sports. If he spent less time thinking of witty team names and finding funny pictures he'd probably do better at fantasy football.  If he spent less time playing with his own nipples he'd probably be less of a gayfish. Oh well, doesn't hurt to dream.

\bigskip
\par\noindent YOU LIKE THAT!! Hats off to Sean for making matters personal and taking the win over Matt while playing Kirk Cousins. Matt's team had double digits across the board but Sean had quite a few single digit performances. However when Matt Forte puts up almost as many points as his age, and your defense and kicker combine for 40 points you know you're gonna have a good week and that's exactly what Sean did. In quite a bold move Sean sat his \#1 pick Todd Gurley. I'm not sure if he's giving him a scolding or what but it was a large risk that really paid off for Sean. Captain Kirk and the rest of Sean's team all put up good points and Jarvis Landry shredded the NE defense for 10 catches 137 yards. Unfortunately Foster and his fine china legs are having troubles again. Lloyd is going to need some production at RB soon once Ware gives the job to Jamaal Charles but for now Lloyd is racking up points to make it into the ship.

I have no idea what Greg's team name means but I think it's a cheat code for Blake Bortles. Starting  
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.65\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.625\textwidth]{week2-bortles.png}
\label{fig:week2-bortles}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent the second half of the game with negative fantasy points he somehow ended up with 18.6 points and spelled the demise of Tyler as we know it. What the fuck is up with these defenses and kickers combining for massive points? Greg won his matchup due to the Denver D and Von Miller. Also, I believe Greg would like for DT to play with an injured hip from now on because he produced solid WR2 value unlike his first game. Decker also absorbed some of Marshall's targets. Walker shrugged off his slow start and exploded onto the TE scene like a bomb\dots but unfortunately some of the shrapnel from said bomb shredded some tendons in AP's knee. Greg is basically going without his first pick the entire season considering AP only put up a combined 7 points the first 2 weeks. Greg's weakest area now is his shitty RB group but the return of Jamaal Charles is looming which bodes well for Greg. Hopefully his stacked WR core and the Denver D can carry him long enough until Charles comes back with a vengeance otherwise it's up to James White and some waiver wire garbage to take him to the ship.
\bigskip
\par\noindent I know we're not supposed to feel bad for Tyler, but I feel a little bad for him. The odds of the Bort having a comeback like that is pretty slim but it looks like all Greg;s ritualistic cult prayers were heard. Even with Keenan Allen and Woodhead going down, old man Rivers still produces. He;s good at throwing those balls into tight windows as evidenced by his 8 kids. CJA and Marshall are still producing and Marshall had a nice bounce-back performance. Unfortunately Decker outscored Marshall and Marshall's status is still up in the air due to his injury. Lamar Miller still hasn't exploded onto the scene yet like Tyler has hoped. However he's still getting massive volume and Tyler has a monopoly on 2 of the few every down backs in the NFL. Tyler basically lost because his defense wasn't trendy like all the others and put up about 20 points, get with it man. I really think Tyler has a shot at a win next week especially if Julian Edelman gets in some QB action. That would be a god-tier flex play right there and probably the most fun thing to watch ever. Tyler's starting roster is solid, although his TE is worth less than a bar of soap, but his bench leaves something to be desired. If there are any injuries over the season Tyler is going to be the driver of the strugglebus to sacko town.

{Donovan vs. Trevor}}
\par\noindent Playing Blount over Fat Eddie was a risky decision as you never know what you're going to get with the Patriots RBs. However Dono’s risk paid off and Blount put up 18 points. Big Ben, Latavius, Julio, and Fitz all performed well again. Fitzgerald is an animal so far and has provided incredible value from where he was drafted. A surprise play was Clive Walford at TE which Dono cashed in for 14 points. Everything went right this weekend for Dono except for Sammy Watkins who is still hobbled by his foot. Dono's team is solid and he now goes 2-0. I wouldn't call him a powerhouse yet but his team definitely high powered early in the season. Some shrewd start/sit choices have paid off dividends and launched him into first place territory.

\bigskip
\par\noindent Trevor looked to be hanging on to Dono's performance initially but his depth just couldn't match Dono's. Bernard, Gore, and Nelson all were standout performances. Gore and Bernard, two running backs not drafted particularly highly, outscored most of the RB duos on the rest of the league. Gore is still churning out points even with his age and Gio always makes plays if he gets the ball he just often is out-touched by Hill. Unfortunately Drew Brees and the Saints came back down to earth this week and as a result Brees and rookie Michael Thomas only combined for 20 points. Witten and Baldwin didn't amount to much and Trevor is going to need to find a new receiver to replace Doug Baldwin if he's out. Let's see his available replacements: Tyler Lockett (knee problems), Corey Coleman (broken hand, I'm convinced God hates the browns), and Eli Rogers. It looks like the Seahawks duo is poised to play week 3 but if not Eli Rogers, who we all know is Antonio Brown 2.0, is going to need to pick up the slack. Trevor is joining Kyle and Kevin at the bottom of the bracket and is going to need some assistance to avoid being the sacko. Trevor is hoping Gronk's week 3 debut is going to be his ticket out of these dumps.

{Casey vs. Danny}}
\par\noindent For Danny Carson Palmer and the Cowboys duo did well but aside from that his team was silent. Zeke was benched in the 4th quarter due to fumble issues but this shouldn't affect his points going forwards. Dez multiplied his previous point total by a factor of 10 which is either really crazy or really sad depending on how you think of it. Not all hope is lost for Danny. He's still 1-1 and Antonio Gates has a chance to be a top tight end with Woodhead and Keenan Allen out of the picture. Andrew Luck is lying on his bench so Danny has 2 top 7 QBs to trade in case anything goes wrong for his team. Carlos Hyde did what he did last year and disappeared after his stellar week 1 performance. After barely beating out Sean last week, Danny didn't stand a chance this week. If he can find a better WR2 his team would be much improved. I would highly advise for Danny to NOT roster the Oakland defense considering they've let up about 35 points in 2 games straight. But again, as the common theme for the this week just stick to your guns mate.

\par\noindent Speaking of guns, the Casetrain is still flexing his. Danny Woodhead injured? Thomas Rawls injured? It's no matter, I didn't need them anyway, let me just put up a quick 100 points. Casey made some interesting play calls, flexing Rawls over Shepard and playing Joe Flacco. He was saved by Greg Olsen who was the highest scoring TE of the week. AB had what will be his lowest scoring game of the year and Mike Evans had an obscene 17 targets to help pad his stats. While Casey is still rolling I sense some brakes upcoming in the next few weeks. Langford looks to be in poor favor with the Bears coaches and with Cutler out, teams might stack the box a little more. Woodhead is gone and Rawls is still in a fight for the role with Christine Michael. Similar to many other teams Casey's weak point will be his RB core and I believe that will soon cause some engine overheating of this high octane train. Chooo Chooo while you still can Casey.

{Week 3 Review - By Dr. Sean Lloyd Musser \& Maestro Casey H. Mangan}}
Our Dear Leader Kyle had to take a week off from writing the recaps. Luckily some guy named Lloyd teamed up with a literal train to cobble together something comparable to what Kyle were to deliver. The following is a result of that synthesis.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.375\textwidth]{week3-barker.png}
\label{fig:week3-barker}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent this low is kind of a mystery. Honestly I'm not even mad anymore; it's kinda amazing. Like, for anyone else this week to get 61.3 points they would have literally had to sit half of their team. If we were playing golf, Tyler would be rocking an impressive 873,645 under par and a sweet Subway sponsorship deal. But alas, this is a real sport where points are good. (Also, that means Trevor is this week's Bob Barker award winner, which Casey gives out to whoever had the pleasure of beating Tyler that week.)
\bigskip
\par\noindent All we can really say about Tyler's team is why the fuck are you still starting Phillip Rivers Tyler??? He's terrible. Literally his whole team is dead (RIP DANNY WOODHEAD :( ). The only thing he's accomplished in the last 5 years is beating the Dolphins for like the first time since he's been in San Diego. You could take any of the top 5 QBs off of free agency and get more points. And Lloyd forbid you actually were to get positive points from a defense. It's not playing the Pittsburgh defense over the Eagles defense that I question as much as why you would ever play either defense in that matchup. Wake up and smell the artisan, fairtrade \$10 coffee Tyler. 
\bigskip
\par\noindent It's not 2010 anymore. Like really, the Eagles have been one of the best offenses so far or at least they've been killing fantasy defenses and the Steelers? Well they're the Steelers, I'm pretty sure Big Ben was crafted in a lab to throw touchdown passes up the butthole of opposing secondaries to Antonio McCringleberry. Not that they did that this week but still not the two offenses that you want to bet against week to week. Otherwise you have some low floor guys but most of them have a decent ceiling and my boy Lamar is gonna kill it this year, in\c{s}allah. So factoring that in, you have an upside of about

\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent 70 points a week with a floor of 50. So as long as you play Greg whose bench has literally run out of crutches for its hobbling players or Matt who hasn't had a decent matchup since the winter of '92 you should be able to string together 1 or 2 wins this year keeping yourself in contention with Kyle for last place. I know it's early, but burn of the year goes out to Trevor for absolutely roasting Tyler in the Facebook chat, so bring some popcorn and gather around to watch Tyler's team burn down to ashes in the coming weeks. In case you didn't notice, Tyler renamed his team this week. Even he recognizes his team is going down in flames. However, we must give credit where credit is due. Tyler, you have the most TEs. Congrats. No award for that though, sorry. The man who makes regular appearances on my favorite twitter feed (@\_FloridaMan), Kevin, has the opportunity to pour more gasoline on the tire fire this week. Thus ends this week's edition of /r/roastme of our precious Tyler. Sean and I promise that none of the rest of you will be taken to task in such a manner this week. Maybe.
\bigskip
\par\noindent  As for Trevor, don't let the fact that he had the easiest matchup so far this year distract from the fact
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.65\textwidth}
\centering

\par\noindent 7 that his team is stacked. Remember a month ago at Kyle's house how we thought none of Trevor's picks made any sense. Shame on we the doubters. After playing Gronk who was out and only getting 2 points from the Green Bay defense he still busted out a monster 138 points! And if he'd played a TE and his best line up he would have been on his way to hitting that rare and coveted 200 point mark. So if you're wondering who to be watching out for early in the season you don't have to look any further that Hot Fuzz. Keep an eye out for flashing lights in your rearview because the boy in blue is locked and loaded. Trevor's super stacked team and pleasant demeanor give him the rare ability to play both good cop and bad cop. At the same time. Next up in Interrogation Room B to confess to the dominance of Hot Fuzz: Lloyd.

He put up more than enough points to get the W with the Minnesota Defense baffling audiences with an absolute domination of the defending NFC champs. Unfortunately for the Casetrain his faithful conductor Joe Flacco turned out to be nothing but steam having his only points come from a rushing TD while Jeremy Langford was unable to get a ticket for the trip leaving the game early with a severe ankle sprain. RIP. In fact at this point, the Casetrain's lineup doesn't have anymore RBs. Only RIPs. I’m sure he can't wait for Dono's lapdog Tom to come back from his four week house arrest. And in case you were wondering (pun intended), the Casetrain doesn't run on steam. The Casetrain runs on blue Doritos and bad puns. And he'll need a lot of them this week to take down noted ABBA fan, Matt.

But rather than crawl back into his cave to hibernate, Bear stuck to his guns while the Atlanta Falcons forgot that they had wide receivers and vowed only to give the ball to Freeman and Coleman setting up one of the biggest upsets of the week. Grizzly Bears everywhere rejoiced while fantasy owners cowered as Connor who put all his eggs into the week 4 success basket is now 3-0 and with the return of upstanding citizens Le'veon Bell this week and Josh Gordon next week. We're all basically fucked. Especially since waiver wire pickups Jordan Howard and future league MVP Kenny Dixon give Connor the RB depth you'd put honey on your chest and tie yourself to a tree for. Be ready to be devoured because A Grizzly Bear is out for his next meal and we all know James (and his new team photo) is the one that we would eat first of it came down to it.

{Matt vs. Danny}}
\par\noindent Preface, I (Sean) just started drinking beer, so this could get hairy. Now pitching for Magnamellis number one needle dick. Number one needle dick. Matt is in line to be the highest scoring 8th place team that the fantasy world has ever seen. Which makes him the opposite of 2015 Sean. It seems that Matt has backed the wrong conceptual horse because despite being 2nd in points he just can't buy a win. At this point Matt is basically just suffering the effects of picking Jamaal Charles over Spencer Ware. A rookie move for the supposedly veteran defending champ. Although at this point it seems like neither of us are going to win our bet as it seems Charles and Foster are both doomed to never play a game this year. But let's talk about people he actually has on his team. Kelvin Benjamin is a good place to start. 0 points. Goose egg. Nada. However you wanna say it after his breakout game last week Benjamin, along with the rest of the Housecats, were utterly useless. Maybe some parallels can be found between the NFC champs atrocious start to the season that seems likely to continue, and the defending fantasy champ Matt's start flopping around like a fish out of water to a 1-2 start with a tough matchup this week. Brandin Cooks certainly didn't help the cause scoring a measly 2.9 points, which is pretty dismal considering the Saints put 32 points on the board. It's almost like Drew Brees wanted Matt to lose. However, Matt showed off his strong core racking up 119.6 points between basically four players. But with only half of his team showing up you can't help but wonder like Radiohead if he's doing it to himself in these tough loses. Early year prediction? Matt goes .500 while scoring the 3rd most points in fantasy only to lose in the first round to Trevor. This week he'll continue to score a lot of points but continue his losing streak when he gets run over by the Casetrain. Speaking of Samuel L. comparisons, 
\bigskip
\par\noindent Danny Danny Danny. If there's ever been a more fantastic collection of men I don't know of it. (And

Sean is a history major, so that actually means a lot.) I don't think anyone saw Danny as a serious threat after he drafted not only Zeke Elliot but also Dez Bryant despite Romo now bearing a close resemblance to Samuel L. Jackson in Unbreakable \textit{(10/10 reference here guys!)}. Speaking of Samuel L. comparisons, 
Danny made out a lot better than the Australian guy in Pulp Fiction. Which makes him this week's Samuel L. Award Winner. But The Fantastic Men looked to be just that this week as Sanders, Elliot, and Rudolph of Minnesota had breakout games this week. And if it isn't Carlos Hyde coming along

\par\noindent to fuck over anyone in his path.  Now I fucking hate Carlos Hyde as he's personally dealt me two losses in as many seasons but at least now someone else feels my pain as Hyde's 25 points were the difference maker in this 135.7-119.6 matchup. So with Danny at a surprising 2-1 to start the season he's teaching us Americans a thing or two about football and making it look as easy as cookin some shrimp on the barbie. This week The Men will take aim at the Hit Squad \textit{(they're playing the Frisky Kittens you moron)}.

{Greg vs. Sean}}
\par\noindent Ugh. This was probably the hardest to watch match up of the week as The Frisky Kittens were nothing of the sort and Greg sputtered out of control not even breaking the 70 point mark. Greg's trouble started with his injuries and his bench had so many outs the SF Giants considered recruiting him as a closer (which actually might not be a bad fit in all honesty). However the trouble continued when Greg failed to make a last minute lineup change at tight end that nearly proved crucial. Greg's celebrity crush Blake Bortles continued to sputter In another dissAPointing week scoring only 11 points and showing his inner Philip Rivers. This left Greg's team of backups and benchwarmers to remind us why they're backups and benchwarmers. With the only player to score less than James White at 1.9 points was Delanie Walker at 0 pretty impressive considering Walker watched from the sidelines and White had 3 carries and a reception. The kKttens are gonna need to get a lot more friskier this week as they head down under to take on the Fantastic Men. I think we all know which adjective beginning with the letter F will prevail.

\par\noindent (That's what I found when I Google image searched Lloyd kittens.) I made the Lloydiest of Lloyd moves replacing Will Fuller V (who apparently was successful enough as just Will Fuller so now he needs a V at the end of his name) for Jordan Mathews at the last minute and played Spencer Ware over Gurley for one last joyride week. Naturally, Gurley decided to show up to the game this week and actually managed 2 touchdowns but with the amount of reps he received, his overall yardage still remains disturbingly low for such a high draft pick. So, in typical fashion I tried my best to run my team into the ground but despite my efforts Greg managed to do even worse. I will say I wake

\par\noindent up at 9 AM every Sunday morning to check rosters and change my lineup and never have problems and that's all I say about thaaat. Which means Sean is back to his old tricks of last year. You remember. The one where he scores so few points you'd think: ``there's no possible way he can win.'' But sure enough he does anyway. The Lloyd looks favorably on his favorite player. Greg is in for a rough few weeks and is gonna need some clutch waiver pick ups to help his war torn team. As for me? Well I've got plenty of good players but don't expect any good lineup moves from me in weeks to come. And besides, what does it matter? Lloyd's gonna get his skull bashed in by the Fuzz this week anyway.

{James vs. Kyle}}
\par\noindent Matchup of the week? $\checkmark$
\\ Drama? $\checkmark$
\\ Comeback? $\checkmark$
\\ Kyle losing in the clutch? $\checkmark$
\\\par\noindent Thank goodness for James and Connor that the Atlanta Falcons don't have some sort of star wide receiver to throw to so they have to rely on their 1 and 2 running backs to take all the receiving and running yards. But we'll get back to that. Kyle came out strong this week ready for a fight. T.Y. Hilton, LeSean McCoy and Demarco Murray combined for a massive 76.5 points. Unfortunately, Kyle has clearly learned nothing from the Lloyd and put faith in the Miami Dolphins of all places. For the most veteran member of our fantasy league, a mistake like this seemed all but impossible. That, and Eli Manning's last minute game losing touch held Kyle short of greatness but still with 131.2 points and a seemingly insurmountable 23.5 point lead over James with James only having Tevin Coleman of the Falcons left to play. Not exactly who I'd want in my corner at that point, but if the struggles of former 12-1 terrifictina23 (Kyle’s old AIM screen name) \textit{(holy fuck, another 10/10 reference here!)} have taught us anything, it's that we should expect the unexpected. Despite a lackluster performance from the usually super Cam Newton, Melvin Gordon and Allen Robinson  with a Tyler-esque 37 points between them, James, in a true Lloyd fashion, got 33 points from his defense and kicker. Still, he  found himself desperately behind. But then along came Polly. Uh, I mean Tevin. WHAT THE FUCK Atlanta. Or maybe more accurately what the fuck New Orleans because they gave up touchdowns number 2, 3, and yes 4 on the year to Coleman. I think Coleman either forgot that he was supposed to be \#2 to Freeman or Matty Ice forgot how to throw passes to actual wide receivers because Coleman took home 89 yards of 12 carries and 3 receptions to go along with his three shiny touchdowns. 
\smallskip
\par\noindent The most baffling part of this matchup is who is now in the top and bottom of the league. Kyle, residing at a dismal 0-3 early in the season, is gonna need to make some major changes if he wants to find himself back in the championship match. I would suggest playing players that don't suck, but hey just because I've won a couple games doesn't mean I know everything. And then there's James who apparently does
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.575\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent  know everything because after a bold grab of the 11th draft spot the Hit Squad has bumped and humped it's way into a first place tie with A Grizzly Bear. 
\\\par\noindent Be ready for what should the blockbuster matchup of week 4 as the remaining undefeated teams go head-to-head. Kyle, meanwhile, looks to turn the page with a new team name against Dono. It could very well be possible the Great Cornjulio himself continues the struggles of his former master. Either way, Kyle needs something for his bunghole after another tough loss.

{Kevin vs. Donovan}}
\par\noindent Well I saved the most mid tier for last. I don't even think the people in this matchup were interested in 
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.60\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.575\textwidth]{week3-hawaii.png}
\label{fig:week3-hawaii}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent it. But lo and behold Kevin rang the bell, slid down a pole and grabbed the hoses finally putting out the Fire that is his team long enough to give Dono a sizable beating, snatching away his hopes of staying undefeated. Dono had some major disappointments as Big Ben had as many points as he did rushing yards. So\dots 7. I actually had to check and see if Julio left the game early because he was actually less noticeable than the filler analysis lady that they stick on the sidelines making one whole catch off of 7 targets. If I actually went through and listed all the players that were garbage this week for Dono it would be the second longest and most boring summary of the week. So, in summary it's really a miracle that Kill or be Killed scored 82.9 points as it is. If it weren't for a solid performance of Blount, Dono would have been well deserved of receiving the least amount of points this week award. At this point I think it's safe to assume Dono was having a bit too much in Hawai'i and mixed up his priorities. Back in California maybe he'll get his head on straight and give us something to write about for week 4 against Kyle, but I wouldn't hold your breath. 
\bigskip
\par\noindent As for the Tallanastee Fireman or whatever, some rare praise is coming his way. I don't know how but  
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.30\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.275\textwidth]{week3-kevin.png}
\label{fig:week3-kevin}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent he actually got 9 players to give him more than 100 points, which is pretty spectacular. While the Seahawks D as well as Crowell and Hopkins put up some disappointing numbers, Kevin proved that you don't actually need much in the way of touchdowns to win a matchup with the aforementioned Matty Ice being the sole source of the end zone. This must provide some hope for Dono moving forward as his team combined for 0 TDS and an INT this week. Kevin looks as though he could be holding on to a strong core of players for now. But with a few low floor players hanging around in the roster, it's hard to imagine he'll be able to gain much momentum of the win going into next week. Not that he'll need any momentum as his next opponent is the one that you wish you had: Tyler ``Tirefire'' Edwards. After that, who knows, maybe there are a few fires left to be fought. 

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 3 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{It's Fire Season} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards} -- Admit it. You saw this coming. To add insult to injury he also the highest number of points against. Pobre Tyler.
\item \textbf{Frisky Kittens} -- \textit{Greg Ebert} -- So far they've put up as much of a fight as a not so frisky kitten. Someone get them some nutritious catnip. They’ve got nothing on Lump and Tux. 
\item \textbf{Tallanastee Firestoppers} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan} -- After realizing he wasn't going to stop the train soon, he changed his name and it lead to his first W. Is this a sign of things to come? 
\item \textbf{Even Siemians} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty} -- It's weird that I'm ranking Kyle this low. I'm used to him dominating at most everything. I suppose it's what happens when you have the second most points against. He is sixth in points scored though. So don't sleep on the newly renamed Siemieans. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan} -- The Men have a fantastic record and put in a fantastic performance last week. Their not quite as fantastic performance during the first two weeks made me hesitant to rank them any higher. Although I'm sure I'll soon see how dumb it was to rank Danny's team lower than Lloyd's.
\item \textbf{Lloyd's Loids} -- \textit{Sean Musser} -- Speaking of, just like Sean in his all male U.S. History class, the Lloyds are also sitting pretty at 2-1. Make fun of him if you will, but don't underestimate Sean's ability to face low scoring opponents. It's happened often enough that I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence. He might actually be onto something here. 
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan} -- So far Dono's been killin behind some great RB depth. That's all I have to say about that. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Goes to Ethpain} -- \textit{Casey Mangan} -- Don't expect the train to stop again anytime soon$^\dag$ folks. He's rolling straight into the playoffs behind the conductor AB. ($^\dag$ Pending RB injuries).
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham} -- Strange to see him sitting at 1-2 with all those points scored and a deep team. He has faced some tough competition thus far. I'm sure he'll right the ship sooner rather than later. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney} -- Hard to believe he had his first win of the season. I expect much more of that from the Fuzz. 
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna} -- He's undefeated and has scored the most points. Can't not put him near the top of the list. Also, I can't get enough of that new team picture. 
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed} -- He's 3-0, has depth at running back, and is only getting stronger as he mauls more innocent talk show hosts. He could very well overtake James for most points scored in the coming weeks.

{Week 4 Review - By Walter \& The Lloyd}}
Kyle made up some shitty excuse for why he couldn't write do a writeup this week. So instead reading some beautiful prose from the fingertips of Dead Leader, we will instead watch as these two dingbats (Casey and Sean) once again man the helm and attempt to cobble together something that resembles a recap for the week.

stupid while they commit crimes? So stupid to the point where the police just have to show up, do no real police work, and make an easy arrest. When you have some free time and nothing better to do (no don't commit a crime), Google image search dumb criminals. It's hilarious. I'm personally a fan of such shows. Thus, the matchup of Sean vs. Trevor brought me some great entertainment this week. Sean had performed so poorly, as he usually does, that Trevor did little more simply show up to the 911 call of a disturbingly low number of points in the neighborhood. He surveyed the scene and saw Sean waffling around like the Miami offense. Although you'd expect more from them, Kirk Cousins and Todd Gurley did okay for the Loids. Everyone else on Sean's team, not so much. When you only have two players score more than 10 points, you're not going to win. Like robbing a gun store with a knife, it's just destined to fail. Perhaps he shouldn't have left the grenade Will Fuller V on his bench exploding with points. I think Sean's days of scoring as few points as possible while still winning are coming to an end. It was quite a run. Sean had played an opponent with an off week so often, it can't be a coincidence. Kevin hopes that week 5 continues the new trend of Sean's opponents pulling the Lloyd strategy on the man himself when Portland plays at Florida. 
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.455\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent After observing this, Officer Carney called off his back up, wiped the jelly donut crumbs from Sean's face, and casually apprehended the Loids behind largely pedestrian performances from his starters. Drew Brees put up less than 30 points, which is weird. Gio Bernard's 20 point performance in week 2 seems to be moving farther back in the rearview mirror of the Crown Vic. Frank Gore continues to have no televised interviews and many solid fantasy performances. Terrelle Pryor and Michael Thomas continued their momentum with some solid outings. All in all, it was (just barely) enough to make up for a -1 from Stevie G at K and throw the Loids into the back of the squad car. Maybe a night in the joint will help Sean get his life, I mean fantasy team, in order. Trevor, meanwhile, might want to do some soul, I mean waiver wire/trade block searching as the Fantastic Men likely present a tougher challenge this week.

\par\noindent Rules would help you this week. Well, just like your decision to trot out the rotting corpse of OBJ against the invincible Vikings defense, you were wrong. And I'd like to direct your attention to the photo below to remind you what happened to the O'Doyle family at the end of the film. Why you wished that fate upon your team is beyond me. Trevor Siemian's shoulder seems to symbolize your team these days. You're not the Broncos Kyle. In fact, while they sit at an impressive 4-0, you're 0-4 next to Tyler in the bottom of Sacko Gorge. So much potential squandered by some silly injury. At least Dono beat you soundly enough you don't obsess over those nagging “what if?” questions, like should I have started Michael Floyd? (Spoiler alert: yes, Kyle. You should have started Michael Floyd.) I sincerely hope that your time as a member of the Marty B Unicorn family goes better. That said, there is hope for you this week Kyle. It's the Christmas morning of the Fantasy Season for you. You woke up really early, quietly slipped out of your room, tiptoed down the hall into the living room only to find that Santa got you exactly what you've been waiting for all year: a matchup you actually have a chance of winning! Yes that's right. All eyes will be on the bottom of Sacko Gorge as Tyle and Kyler this week. I personally can't wait.

\bigskip
\par\noindent Well it's time to move on from Drive Off a Cliff McNutty to our biggest improvement of the week in Donovan Sheridan. Back from his vacay in Hawaii and presumably drinking less drinks with umbrellas in them, Dono got back on track this week and put up 40 more points than last week. Big Ben put up big numbers against Kansas City. Hunter Henry was a great pickup off the waiver wire reeling in an impressive 14.1 points in the absence of Tyler Eifert. But my favorite performance of the week for Dono was someone else. Yeah that's right. The Liam Neesons of Fantasy Football. The only one who can mess with the Batmans: The Great Cornjulio himself. Accounting for dfrac{1}{3} of his points and literally betraying his former owner in the process, the Great Cornjulio slaughtered the once mighty Kyle. 300 yards receiving and a TD? It's almost as if Julio and his wingman (on the field and at the bar) Matty Ice intentionally screwed over the unsuspecting lab assistant from California. So while O'Doyle may rule at the game, Julio Jones is the game. If Dono continues to make the right choices at RB each week, he will continue to kill and not be killed. And he's going to need to make the right choices at every position and draw a Sea Bear circle, as this week A Grizzly Bear is coming to town.

{Kevin vs. Tyler}}
\par\noindent Well, well, well. Here we are again Tyler. I really am running out things to say. It truly is fire season in the tire fire. He did get decent performances from a few players (Rivers, Lamar, CJ, and B-Marsh). Meanwhile his WR1, WR2, and TE combined for 10.6 points. But the real dud of the week was the Chiefs D/ST putting up -5 points to AB McCringleberry and the boys from Pittsburgh. You know the old saying that defense wins championships? Well apparently the opposite is also true. Defense also loses Sackos. So it's probably good for him (and bad for Kyle) that the Eagle's D/ST are coming back from a bye week. With the return of Brady, Edelman should slot into one of his WR slots. I looked through his roster for the first time in a while today, and I was stunned to see that Tyler actually has good players. But then there's this thing with Tyler where he makes good personnel choices only to have his players betray him in the game. Let's revisit a conversation from way back in week 1:
\begin{verbatim}
Sunday 9/12 5:00pm
Tyler: Who to start though? [John] Brown or Edelman?
Sean: Brown for days
Tyler: Thanks Sean so I will start Edelman
Matt: Yeah I don't trust Sean for shit
Tyler: Nice try you snake
Sean: I can't wait for brown to blow up on your bench
Sean: Trust me I know a lot about good bench players 
    [Sean's bench outscored both his and Danny's starters that week. So he in fact did
    prove himself knowledgeable.]
Matt: Edelmen is a muuuch better receiver but Brown has the better qb
Dono: Buttttt Edelman will probably be targeted more with little options while az has
a lot
Matt: True

     [Same day, 45 minutes later]
Casey: Look at Edelman go!
Dono: Edelman is ham so far
Matt: Carson Palmer and the O-Line has looked like a steamy pile of dog shit
Greg: I like steamy things
Greg: James [McKenna-Ebert] is a douche and I hate him. He is gonna win the league.
Matt: Nah he's not smart enough
Greg: Good point
Greg: Remember when Tyler started Edelman
Casey: I knew whichever Tyler didn't pick would do great
Greg: Hahahaha true
Matt: Not even a target for Brown
Dono: Told you Edelman lol
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{10pt}\par\noindent Julian Edelman week 1: 11.7
\par\noindent John Brown week 1: 1.3
\par\noindent So as we can see here in this case example (that clearly is too small of a sample size from which to draw any meaningful conclusions, but we're gonna roll with it anyway), Tyler dooms his starters to mediocrity on a weekly basis. However there is a silver lining to all of this that was pointed out after the NE-AZ game:
\begin{verbatim}
Sunday 9/12 9:13pm
Matt: To be fair to Tyler, he would still be losing right now even if he had played 
Edelman
\end{verbatim}

\vspace{-20pt}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.375\textwidth]{week4-nopoints.png}
\label{fig:week4-nopoints}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent 
And there you have it. Tyler is doomed no matter what. Free will seems to be an illusion for Tyler. As week five approaches, all I can say is: have at em Kyle. He's all yours. Don't blow it. Thus ends this week's edition of /r/roastme of our precious Tyler. So that's it for the fantasy recap of week 4. You stay classy football fans. See you on Sunday morning for the most important event of your otherwise pitiful, meaningless lives.

\end{wrapfigure} 
\\[5mm]
\par\noindent Oh wait. Yeah, that's right Tyler didn't beat himself. He had an opponent help him. Sorry Kevin. As expected, Kevin wins this week's Bob Barker Award Winner as he took down Tyler in convincing fashion. Kevin repeated his game plan from last year's Sacko Bowl and wisely made no attempt to put out the fire and let Tyler burn himself for a fourth consecutive week. If you go back to last year, Tyler has lost 8 straight. So Tyler hasn't won a fantasy football matchup since week 12 of last year. Ouch. But in reality, anytime you put up close to 100 points you give yourself a chance to win against any opponent. And Kevin did that. Aside from DeAndre Hopkins putting up less than a point and injury issues at RB, Kevin's players put some solid performances. It's nice to see the ageless wonder Steve Smith, Sr. still putting up big numbers. It's hard to say if Kevin will linger in the middle of the pack or make a playoff push, but if he makes some smart decisions between now and December, unlike his opponent, Kevin could find himself outside of Sacko contention. Maybe it's a good thing that hurricane made him do auto draft after all.

{Connor vs. James}}
\par\noindent This was the blockbuster matchup everyone was waiting for. The fight for glory against the two powerhouse teams A Grizzly Bear and Hit Squad. While we're all still completely baffled how James managed 
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.50\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.475\textwidth]{week4-tannehill.png}
\label{fig:week4-tannehill}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent to draft anything close to a winning team you can't be mad at his early results coming into this game undefeated with probably the most points so far (I can't fucking remember and I can't be bothered to check). Hit Squad came out of the gate this week as if he was playing to win back Jessica \textit{[ed. note: this is the sickest burn!]} getting a combined 43.6 points from A.J. Green and the Bengals D as Cincinnati steam-rolled my one true love, The Miami Dolphins. While the Dolphins may be 1-3 they've already proven James prediction of an 0-16 season wrong so suck on that James! Hit Squad continued to hump and dump its way forward with a shocking 20.9 point performance from Melvin Gordon as the Chargers looked like they might actually 
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.36\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{week4-bear.png}
\label{fig:week4-bear}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent do something only to lose by a point to possibly one of the most successful football franchises in the history of the game. Yes Miami, there is actually a team out there worse than you. Huge performances from Jordan Reed (yes, I liked that) and Allen Robinson led James team to a monster 133.5 points and A Grizzly Bear was left to play catch up in what looked to be a bad salmon spawn season. 
\bigskip
\par\noindent Connor actually had some solid performances with Alex Smith (a bold choice for a play, and a nearly disastrous one, as Kansas City were on the wrong end of the Rape of the Year award losing a brutal game to Pittsburgh 43-14) and some good outings from Christine Michael, Jordan Howard and Le'veon Bell. However, the core of Connor's team went back to the cave without any fish with 4 players 
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.40\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.375\textwidth]{week4-manziel.png}
\label{fig:week4-manziel}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent combining for an abysmal 22.4 points and Stefon Diggs coming nowhere near to completing the epic comeback that Connor needed for the W as A Grizzly Bear put up a grizzly 102.6 points overall points. It was Connor's first lost of the season and left the fantasy world wondering if what looked to be a powerhouse team could be faltering as Josh Gordon of the Browns will now be spending his Sundays trying to avoid paying child support so he can have enough money to pay off the guards to help him sneak booze and bitches in so Johnny Football and him can throw some ragers. Will the core of Connor's team be enough to carry him to the promise land or is this the sign of an upcoming hibernation for the country bears? Well how the fuck should I know, I'm busy getting ready for hockey season leave me alone.

\par\noindent At this point Matt's team is just so fucking bad I think it's our moral obligation to pitch in and send him \begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.230\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.225\textwidth]{week4-suck.png}
\label{fig:week4-suck}
\vspace{-20pt}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent some more one sided trades and maybe just sit your QBs when playing him just to give him a fair shot. At the very least we should buy him this shirt. The Naggers seem utterly determined to force Matthew Stafford to play well but so far the only thing he's accomplished is consistently throwing interceptions with another 2 picks in Week 4. But I know it can be hard actually going to the trouble to play good players. Further evidenced by Crabtree playing from the bench this week instead of Brandon Cooks. If you want to know specifically where or how Matt lost this matchup than look no further as Crabtree put up a monstrous 30 points that would have been more than enough to win the matchup. But hey it sucks to suck. The rest of Matt's team did some things and got some points but 
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.440\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.425\textwidth]{week4-garbage.png}
\label{fig:week4-garbage}

\par\noindent it was all pretty worthless and not really worth mentioning. It's just like when the garbage smells bad, you don't dig through it to figure out the source of the smell, you just tie up the bag and toss it in the dumpster. That's all that can really be said for The Naggers who put up a measly 95.9 points to drop to 1-3 on the season. 
\bigskip
\par\noindent The train kept a rollin all night long for Casey though as Tavon Austin 
was the lone under performer this week and Casey averaged around 14 points per player without Austin included leading the Casetrain to put up 112.6 
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.440\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.425\textwidth]{week4-choochoo.png}
\label{fig:week4-choochoo}
\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent points for the easy win. Casey was a perfect example of what to do as he put in his best possible lineup. Maybe Matt could take a page from his book. But I doubt it. Joe Flacco actually fucking did something and apparently he even knows how to run, although he certainly doesn't move out of the way for all the sacks he takes but regardless he finished the game with a rushing TD and a passing TD to lead the Train into victory. At this point the Casetrain looks nearly unstoppable and passengers are concerned that if it gets going any faster it might just go fast enough to push the Delorean back into the future. Its early in the Season but Casey, James and Connor have shown themselves to be clear favorites while the championship players of last year Kyle and Matt how shown themselves to be absolutely useless. And it looks as though Matt's so called ``depth'' and one sided trades are doing anything for him. So I would look elsewhere for entertainment in the coming weeks.

\par\noindent I keep waiting to see Danny's team just dip off into nothingness but I'll be damned if the Dallas Cowboys don't have one of the best rushing offenses in the League. I'll be the first one to say that I called that 
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.440\textwidth}

\par\noindent wrong; who knew that the offensive line that reminded Romo just how many bones he can break in his body would actually be able to support Elliot on his now monstrous rookie campaign? This week he rolled in with another TD and 138 yards for 22.2 points (the first of many stellar performances for the week). Matt Jones and Emmanuel Sanders combined for another 39.6 points and the LA defense managed to stand up to the cardinals for another 13.9. Fuck Carlos Hyde. I just\dots ugh\dots fuck him. I refuse to write about him. Overall Danny managed to put up a ridiculous 138.2 points leaving any team, but especially Greg's, with little to no hope of scraping out
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.240\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.225\textwidth]{week4-fantastic.png}

\end{wrapfigure} 
\par\noindent  a win. At 3-1 it would be idiotic to say that The Fantastic Men aren't a team to watch. I would think they'll continue to be pretty fucking fantastic. 
\bigskip
\par\noindent This is of course the complete opposite of Greg's team whose weekly name changes are doing about as much good as Chris Ivory (2.9 points this week). I honestly don't know what Greg's team is called right now, but what I do know is that they lost horribly. If there was any team besides Tyler obviously that should consider throwing in the towel at this point it's Greg. Even with Blake Bortles begin goat or ham or whatever animal you want to call him, the rest of the team did so little that it really didn't matter. As Greg got about half his points between just two guys and the other 7 combined for about 50 points. Not a pretty site. At this point it might be time to consider some major roster moves Greg because Blake Bortles and the Denver Defense a team does not make.

\SSs{Casey's Week 4 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{It's Fire Season} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- I mean, come on. I'm running out of things to say about why Tyler is at the bottom. He's just here. Get used to it. But look out folks. Next week we will only have one more winless team. That's right, Kyle and Tyler duke it out for the right to have a one in the win column for the first time since Kyle was 12-1. Feels like forever ago, doesn't it?
\item \textbf{Lloyd's Loids} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 7)} -- Sunday was opposite day in Lloyd World. Sean, known for his ability to beat the weakest performer in any given week, just barely gets edged out by the Fuzz. I know, I'm just as surprised as you are. Aside from a monster performance in week 2, Sean hasn't done much to impress thus far. Is this a sign of things to come?
\item \textbf{Frisky Kittens} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 11)} -- It's nice to see the kittens are getting friskier, but they ran into a tough matchup this week. They still sit very low in points scored and don't forget, Greg's only win so far was against perennial whipping boy Tyler.  
\item \textbf{Tallanastee Firestoppers} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 10)} -- The Firemen are trending up each week and have the strength to compete week in and week out, but it still seems like he'll have an uphill battle. If he can manage to trade one of his three stellar QBs for some help at a FLEX position tho, he could become that much more dangerous. 
\item \textbf{O'Doyle Rules} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 9)} -- Who rules? Sadly, this week not O'Doyle. But I think Kyle and his celebrity look alike Chris Farley have their best (fantasy) football still ahead of them and at least are a candidate to sneak into the playoffs based on points scored. Could Kyle be this year's Matt? I think a blowout win against Tyler next week will get him the momentum he needs to make a push for the Playoffs. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 3)} -- The Fuzz continue their winning streak as the Lloyd hath provideth a favorable matchup this weekend. The Fuzz better do some investigating and find out who stole 50 points from them since their huge win last week. Regardless, they remain in the hunt to push for one of the final playoff spots. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Goes to Ethpain (LW 5)} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 5)} -- Well the Casetrain kept up enough steam this week to keep rolling to Spain's famous Estaci\'{o}n de los Playoffs. Scoring at least 100 points every week is a recipe for success. With some health and a little luck at RB, he could do some damage with prodigal son Tommy back at the helm. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 8)} -- Another strong performance from the Fantastic Man himself, Danny Noonan. One wonders how he does it while studying law and suing governments. Keep up the good work Danny, in all respects. You're a top bloke. I apologize for having ranked you lower than the Lloyds last week. I knew I'd regret that decision. 
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 6)} -- Dono is now back on track after a poor performance last week, handing Tyler surrogate Kyle his fifth straight loss. Now I know what you're saying. “Casey, we're only in week four. And he didn't even win a regional qualifying match.” Well to that I counter: Blair Walsh. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, nice team Dono. 
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 4)} -- I know he's only 1-3, but some of his key performers had an off week and he is still second in points scored. I still think he'll work his way into the playoffs as his next four opponents only have five combined wins.
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 1)} -- Once A-aron comes back from the bye week and Mike Evans doesn't play against Denver, The Bear will be back. I bet Marty B still haunts him though. Ghost Marty B could rack up some serious points now that Saggy Balls Brady is back. In a sneaky move you probably didn’t see, Connor traded and then later picked up future league MVP Kenny D all in the same week. More honey for the bear. 
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 2)} -- Well when you beat the \#1 team, are \#1 in points scored (by almost 50), and remain undefeated, you wind up at \#1 on Casey's power rankings. It scares me to write about how good James is, because I have to play him next week. When's my matchup against Tyler, again?

{Tyler vs. Kyle}}
\par\noindent Martellus Bennett. A six pack. A functioning fantasy team. A win. The difference between Tyler and I in the 2016 fantasy season is a win. Riding high on the back of Marty B and his 3 touchdowns Kyle streaked to his first win of the season. No thanks to Eli Manning, the epitome of mediocre, and Djax, the boom or bust who always booms on your bench, Kyle begins a win streak that will take him to the playoffs. Shady Mccoy, Murray, and the Bills DST all put up 15+ points to put his team in a position to win. Unlike the Giants, Kyle has a couple closers named TY Hilton and Marty B. TY Hilton continues his hot streak and shiftily makes his way to a near 30pt game. The game turned from a close matchup to a joke though on Sunday morning during basketball when all Dono yelled was ``KYLE MARTELLUS BENNET TOUCHDOWN'' the whole morning. Connor didn't put trust in Marty B and Kyle trusted and nurtured Marty B into the beast that he will be ROS. Watch out James, I'm coming for your squad and your sorry ass.

\par\noindent Well Tyler, it was a good show mate. In the greatest matchup of the 2016 season so far, Tyler just couldn't quite pull through. The toad croaked one too many times. People (Sean) keep asking why Tyler keeps starting Old Man Rivers. 26.4 points is why you keep starting Old Man Rivers. Who cares if the chargers had a 1/38 million chance of losing each of those first 4 games? Rivers continues to deliver and is a fantasy goldmine for the late draft pick that Tyler spent on him. While Rivers continues to be a producer as a late round pick, Miller continues to be a fantasy coalmine with a first round pick. Miller leads the entire NFL in yards without a touchdown\dots so the touchdowns will come eventually right? Miller is a high floor type of guy. Miller is the bellcow back. Miller has no competition. Miller is involved in the passing game. Tyler knows these are all the reasons to hold Miller and that the touchdowns will come eventually. Well, have fun with that buddy. Miller and the rest of the fantasy analysts are straight blueballing. 2.9 points later and Tyler is going to have to wait for week 6 until a Miller TD possibility. CJA is returning to last years committee form and Jeffery continues to struggle with Hoyer as QB. Brandon Marshall is the lone bright spot for Tyler's team, and with Decker out on IR look for Marshall to continue production as the season continues.

{Greg vs. Matt}}
\par\noindent If Miller is blueballing Tyler then my God Matt's balls have long fallen off due to his team's performances. How can a team have so much depth and score so many points yet only have one win? Well, I don't have the same depth but I have intimate knowledge of that kind of situation. Matt even had David Johnson put up 32 points and couldn't get the win. David Johnson didn't destroy the 49ers, he murdered them and had a 76 yd drive and touchdown in which he was the only Cards player that got the ball. Marvin Jones and Michael Crabtree did their part putting up double digits but and Winston salvaged a terrible game but that's about where the positives for Matt's team ends. Orleans Darkwa, Cameron Brate, and Kelvin Benjamin are all under producing. Dustin Hopkins also seems to be taking after Deandre Hopkins and after being a solid kicker for the year is looking like a rookie missing some easy extra points and FGs. Matt, you need to WAKE THE FUUUUCK UP MAAAN! I need you to win some games so I can squeak into the playoffs on points scored! Start managing your team like a real man and make some lineup choices and require some balls because whatever experts you're getting lineup advice for right now is the worst decision you've ever made behind starting Blair Walsh last year.

\bigskip
\par\noindent Gregory Ebert is a small man. He is a shifty man. Gregory Ebert made some shifty lineup choices that go against the norm which won him his matchup. Who starts Tyrell Williams and Theo Riddick over Eric Decker and Jamaal Charles??? Well, Greg does when Jamaal and Decker are on bye/IR. And what a roster move that was. Riddick put up a career high 23.2 points and Tyrell Williams teamed up with Old Man Rivers for 20 points. Since I'm writing this in week 6, and have a sneak preview into the future, I believe NFL players's are actually starting to take offense to Matt's team name and purposely going off when they're matched up against him. The Broncos D was a bit of a letdown for Greg but DT and Delanie put up a combined 30 points, which is all you can ask. Greg's closer for the match was Ryan Tannehill, a popular streaming option for the week. He was the lowest scoring skill position on Greg's team with 3.6 points. I'd advise all members of our league to consult with the Lloyd before starting any Dolphins players not named Foster or Landry. Congratulations Greg, your team is a hogwash of waiver wire pickups and is proof that dedication and working the waiver wire can make you go the distance.

{Casey vs. James}}
\par\noindent Men and women of the jury – The casetrain is back. The high scoring, diesel churning, horn tooting train gets Tom Brady back from suspension and is planning on plowing through anything in his way. I've already talked so many weeks about how Casey's team is good that I'm beginning to get sick of it. Let's do a quick recap: Tom Brady went off, Devonta Freeman went off, Antonio Brown had a quiet game with 18 points, Randall Cobb went off, Greg Olsen went off, Vikings D went off, Adam Vinatieri went off. Yes, even Casey's kicker outscored everyone on James's team except for Brian Hoyer. The Vikings D has been absolutely insane and so has Greg Olsen. Casey's team is probably the most intriguing winning team because of the disparity he produces at two positions that normally don't produce at a high rate. Casey has found consistent options of 15+ points in the Vikings D and Greg Olsen and this forces his opposing teams to need very strong outings from other positions in order to make up for the disparity at TE and DST. As long as the rest of Casey's team does average he has a strong shot at winning games. Antonio Brown and Tom Brady also add to this disparity, who normally outproduce others at their respective positions. I think Casey has one of the most dangerous teams due to those stats and because of it Casey's team will rarely score less than 90 points. I think he is currently top 3 in terms of our power rankings and should have no problem making playoffs.

\bigskip
\par\noindent James has a similar record as Casey, but I don't think he has a similar caliber team as Casey. James struggled with bye week ailments this week, but he should come back strong next week. The real decision for James is do you play Hoyer the destroyer or Cam Newton? While Hoyer might not be the best real-life QB, he's a surprisingly good fantasy QB and has thrown for 300 yds every game so far. Melvin Gordon continues to put up good numbers due to TD production  but that's about all she wrote. Victor Cruz put up an egg, AJ Green with a lackluster 7 points, and Reed and Wallace combined for 18. Unfortunately Reed is now out with a concussion and James is going to need to figure out a way to replace him. In hilarious fashion James was absolutely burned by Tevin Coleman.  The two headed monster in ATL continues to breath fire and Coleman blew up for 24.3 points. Looks like sickle cell anemia hasn't been a big factor in Coleman's production thus far. After a strong start in the first 3 weeks Hit Squad has been slowing down and will be searching for some momentum.

\par\noindent Alright Connor, these MNF wins are starting to get real annoying. In true Connor fashion he scrapes through this week with another win due to MNF performances.  Mike Evans was able to edge out the Carolina DST and a lead even when Winston looked like a sack of potatoes out there. 11 points by both his DST and kicker helped seal the win. While we constantly talk about Lloyd being the matchup king Connor has consistently been the matchup queen. In every matchup except for Kyle week 2 he's just barely been able to beat his opponent on MNF. Connor's team has been putting up slightly above average points and somehow Connor always seems to play the team putting up average points. Some worthy trades and strong waiver pickups in Jordan Howard have kept Connor's lineup full of studs. With his most recent Doug Martin debacle Connor will be looking to roll out a lineup of pure studs outside of his TE position. Look for Connor to pick up steam as the season continues to unfold and no longer need to rely on MNF to beat opponents. Once his bye weeks are over and his team is at full strength Josh Gordon should be able to carry his team to the playoff cagematch.

\par\noindent Remember when Dono's team started off hot but I told everyone to cool their jets because he's known to choke? Week 5 is evidence of the beginning of a slippery slope for Dono. Julio Jones choked against Denver and that is the sole reason while Dono lost. A meager 3.9 points after his 300yd explosion is not what you want from your \#1 pick, even against an elite defense such as Denver. Luckily Dono was bailed out by Big Ben for 30 and Hunter Henry was a sly waiver pickup by Dono who is looking to shape up as an every week TE1 depending on Gates.  Fitzgerald continues to defy age and is a WR2 with every week WR1 upside but unfortunately Dono couldn't maintain pace. Blount, Terrence West, and Eddie Lacy all couldn't break into double digits. Latavius Murray, Sammy Watkins, and Tyler Eifert are all injured for Dono and unfortunately he just didn't have the depth to hang on. If Julio can pick his shit up and put on his best OBJ face Dono's team could be the 5th playoff seed. We'll see if the choking continues or if he makes some lineup changes.

{Trevor vs. Danny}}
\par\noindent Let's have a talk about my main man Danny. Danny is the ghost in our league who is absent from our fantasy chat, our basketball games, and our country.  Danny doesn't have any inside jokes against him except for the fact that he's a Cowboy homer and I haven't really torn apart his team yet. Why you may ask? Not because he's quiet in our league, not because he hasn't had any trades, but because the man is winning. Danny, in his usual modest fashion, is now 4-1 and tied for 1st. Ezekiel Elliot has been a rookie running with something to prove and he put on a show against Cincinatti with 150 yds and 2 TDs. Carlos Hyde is the only worthwhile players in the 49ers and he's been putting up good numbers albeit a little TD dependent. The rotation of Andrew Luck \& Carson Palmer at QB is a good problem to have and Kyle Rudolph, although he had a dud this week, has turned from waiver wire trash to a startable TE1 with Sam Bradford at the helm. Danny is 4-1 with Carson Palmer, Dez Bryant, Jonathan Stewart, and Antonio Gates all out. His record is setting him up impeccably for a strong late season push when all those guys come back healthy. League you've been warned.

\par\noindent Monday night came and Trevor was trying to do his best Connor impression, needing 13 points from Fozzy Whitaker to take the win. Unfortunately Connor has a monopoly on Monday night miracles and Trevor will have to settle for being 2-3. Trevor's team has been putting up high floor numbers consistently each week and just unfortunately hasn't has the boom needed to get a few more wins. Dak Prescott was a great choice as a bye week fill in for Brees and Giovanni Bernard has been stealing looks from Hill recently. If Gio begins to take over that backfield he'll be an RB2 with RB1.5 upside each week in our 0.5 PPR league. Jordy Nelson continues to be effected by Aaron Rodgers struggles though. His only week above 20 points was week 3 against Detroit. Rodgers deep threat in 2014 seems to be missing a step in 2016 and Trevor needs to bank on Aaron Rodgers returning to form fast. Gostkowski hasn't been the godmode kicker he used to be and the 9th round price tag seems a little early in hindsight. However the bright spot for Trevor in this weeks close loss is Gronk. When Martellus Bennet has 60+yds and 3TDs and Gronk is still able to manage 13.4 points you know he is the real deal. It's only a matter of time before he spikes it in the endzone.

{Kevin vs. Sean}}
\par\noindent Sean continues to defy the laws of randomness and consistently plays the opponent who scores next to nothing. It's not even close the amount of points scored he has on him to the next closest person. This week Sean actually did average, with Wentz, Gurley, and Cooper putting up respectable points. Also the Cardinals D/ST lit up the 49ers for 17.5 points. It looks like Gurley is now being used in the passing game a little bit more which is giving him a higher floor than before. Unfortunately Matt Forte, who started out red hot, is not on a steady decline. Bilal Powell is really eating into his work and Sean needs Foster to come back soon to fix up his RB situation. However, Barnidge continues to produce and it looks like Cooper is overtaking Crabtree more as the season goes on. Sean has made some good decisions with hi QB streaming options and Landry usually plays at a higher level than his 4.5 points reveal. Ultimately though, Sean can make whatever the fuck kind of decisions he wants when his opponents are averaging 84.6 points scored against him.

\par\noindent Ladies and gentlemen I think you’re looking at our \#1 r/roastme candidate. I am in agreement with Teacher Casey that Kevin is currently in the bottom of the barrel in our league.  This is what happens when you chase production. A team once littered with studs like Hopkins, TY Hilton, Doug Martin, and Russell Wilson has been slowly and steadily Digging (heh) itself a hole. The perfect analogy for Kevin's team is the Klondike bar commercial. Every time a hot guy in tight jeans walks by Kevin instead of staying true to his man he always turns his head and watches them walk by. Kevin's team is now littered with players that have had a few big games but haven't been able to keep production. What Kevin doesn't understand is that fantasy football isn't a game of numbers, it's a game of trust. You need to trust that your studs will eventually produce at where you drafted them, and if they don't get comparable value. Jimmy Graham and Matt Ryan are going to need to play out of their minds in order to bring Kevin's team out of the sacko and Kevin is going to need some waiver wire gold pickups. With the lowest score so far of the 2016 fantasy season Kevin is having a deadly stare down with r/roastme.




\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 5 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- Rather than go through my usual routine of why Tyler's team is the laughing stock of the league, I must say that this week he was simply doomed by the explosion of Kyle back into fantasy relevance. Had some of his players not had nightmare matchups, Tyler would've put up an admirable amount of points this week. Last week I mentioned that his team is surprisingly talented and that showed once more. Despite the fact that five of his next six opponents are the top five teams in the league, Tyler will win some games this year. At least two. And from there his opponents in sacko territory better not underestimate him. That said, the teams in the top half of my rankings still need not worry about Precious Tyler. Your playoff bound infielders can stay in. I will continue to rank him at the bottom until he actually wins, but I definitely envision a future where a new worst team emerges. 
\item \textbf{Tallanastee Firestoppers} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 9)} -- And that new future worst team, unless his highly questionable moves actually pan out, could very well be the boys from Tallanastee. He has certainly outperformed Tyler to this point, but moving forward I am concerned that we will see more forgettable performances like this week. As his team is struggling to cope with injuries to some key players, I can understand the desire to make risky moves to stay afloat in a very competitive league where all of your potential opponents are realistically capable of scoring 100+ points in any given week. With Diggs and SSSr. injured and having traded away Deandre Hopkins and Doug Martin, his supply of players who can put up huge numbers is dwindling. He better monitor the waiver wire and trade carefully is he is to remain competitive, or at the very least avoid the sacko bowl. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 7)} -- Well Officer Detective Carney had his hands full in Sydney this weekend. The Fuzz's inability to capture the thunder they had early in the season, coupled with quite a few bye weeks, resulted in a tough outing for the boys in blue. I do think they have been underperforming lately, but they'll have to get out of this funk before they move up the rankings. Gotta get out there and earn your stripes rook!
\item \textbf{Frisky Kittens} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- The Frisky Kittens are still purring after surviving the bye week of their team captain and treasurer of the Central Florida Bird Watching Society, Borty Bort. As the Kittens get more players back from bye weeks and injuries, expect them to keep on purring and meowse their way up the standings a little bit. I think we've yet to see the best from these kittens, but until then I'm not changing the kitty litter.
\item \textbf{Lloyd's Loids} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 11)} -- Sean is constantly moving up and down this list every week as his team is hard to pin down. Once again he somehow managed to play the lowest scoring team of the week. At this point we can all agree he's keeping a secret from the rest of us. However, until he makes it clear that he can consistently put up numbers that make him competitive against the league's best, he will continue to float around in the bottom half of the power rankings. So you can keep your infield in when the Lloyd's come to town as well. 

\newpage
\par\noindent This week our top 7 spots are so close that they are almost interchangeable. Only 35 points separate the seventh from the second highest scoring teams through week 5. Only 13.3 points separate the sixth from the third. It's been that close of a season thus far (with a few exceptions already noted above [cough, cough, Tyler \& Kevin, cough, cough]. Excuse my coughing. Anyway, back to actually ranking you silly people. 
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW )} -- Bye weeks were unkind to our dear friend Matthew this week and prevented him from once again moving up in the W column. Now that four of his starters are back from their major bye week party (presumably in the same place Dono went in Hawaii), the Naggers are poised to continue their climb up the points scored column and start earning some W's. Don't sleep on the Naggers and their 1-4 record. Even in an off week they score at least 95, usually much more. These people will annoy you if you don't put up even bigger numbers every week. 
\item \textbf{MARTY B PLZ HELP} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 9)} -- Kyle moved up from 8th to 3rd in points scored after a monster week behind new team captain Marty B. It may be his first win of the season, but Kyle may very well be the real deal. He just put the league on notice. When asked for a comment, he had the following to say: ``MARTY B!!!'' Oh, and congrats on winning the weekly Bob Barker Award. My only hesitation with moving him further up the rankings is the inconsistency from week to week. But if he can continue to crack the 100 point barrier every week he will continue his climb up the rankings, into the playoffs, and, most importantly, back into our hearts.   
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 4)} -- With three of his starters on the mend and Eddie Lacy going down this week, the injury bug has definitely bitten into Dono's team. That said, even without four of first seven draft picks, he still manages to put forth a lot of points every week he's not in Hawaii due to the solid core of players he's formed through smart draft choices in the later rounds and an effective use of the waiver wire. Look for Dono to continue to stay in the playoff hunt with more of the same. 
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 2)} -- Speaking of people who form their team in interesting ways, of all the players Connor started last week, he only drafted three of them. He also consistently stays on the list of teams you definitely don't want to play against on any given week, as Donovan found out this past week. I'm sure he has a few more tricks up his sleeve that will help his team go from good back to great. Additionally, you can't help but love his flair for Dramatic Monday Night Comebacks\textsuperscript{TM}.
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 5)} -- As usual The Men once again put forth a solid (albeit very top heavy) effort and racked up another W. As a fan and fantasy owner, Danny must be anxiously awaiting the return of Dez Bryant because while the W's keep piling up, other teams are starting to catch up in the points scored column. Still, the Fantastically Consistent Men\textsuperscript{TM} are soon to be at full health, always deep, and look well positioned to continue their drive to the playoffs. Also, how about that Ezekiel Elliott guy?
\newpage
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 1)} -- Three types of players weren't kind to the Hit Squad this past week: those with bye weeks, underperformers, and players on Casey's team. Look for the Hit Squad to rebound and get back to their winning ways next week. Like Paulette's Social Security check arriving to the trailer on the 3rd Thursday of every other month, the Squad is very close to a sure thing when they are firing on all cylinders.
\item \textbf{Casetrain Back to Eskool} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 6)} -- As has been my system thus far, when someone dethrones the number one team, becomes the leader in points scored, and moves the top of the standings all in the same week, they get to be número uno in the power rankings as well. This week that person happens to be me, The Casetrain. Who, for the record, doesn't stop. With Tom Brady back at QB, a K and D/ST combo that is capable of putting up 30-40 points every week, the number 1 TE and \#2 WR, and solid names at every position the Casetrain is primed to choo-choo all the way to the playoffs and beyond. While you're sitting around watching your team dwindle around in mediocrity, remember It's still not too late to put on your Ken Bone sweater and hop on the caboose with my other fans.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 6 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{Tallanastee Silver Ferns} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 11)} -- Well, just like he did with his real life cross country team, Kevin got his fantasy team stuck in the mud this week. Cracking the 60 point barrier shouldn't be seen as an improvement, but it actually was for the Kevs this week. The boys in FL better get their act together, and fast. Tyler has more than caught up to him in overall team strength. I know they don't have any hills in Florida, but you're on slippery slope Kevin. Tread lightly. 
\item \textbf{Lloyd's Loids} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 8)} -- Well the Miami Dolphins had themselves a spectacular and unexpected week. What was supposed to be a huge defeat turned into a nice W. Kinda like a normal week from Sean where his opponent lays an egg. This week though, Sean had the exact opposite of that. Which is what happens to Matt every week. So it's ironic that Matt's favorite NFL team pulled a Matt against Sean's boy Jarvis. His mid-week trade did not pay him any dividends this week and only two of his players did anything of note. Have we reached the end of Sean's incredible, statistically improbable run of having so few points scored against? If so, Sean's team is in big trouble. Actually The Loids are already in big trouble: They're ranked below Tyler. 
\item \textbf{Kellyanne Conway} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 9)} -- Injuries to some key contributors, a few disappointing performances, and trusting Jamaal Charles 1.0 over Jamaal Charles 2.0 did not help Greg in this week. But just like Donald Shitbag Trump is Kellyanne Conway's ride or die, Blake Bortles is Greg's ride or die. Which meant this week he got run over by the Casetrain. Which makes the Casetrain the Hillary Clinton of Fantasy Football. I expect more points from the old kitties every week, but not enough to seriously challenge for a playoff spot. 
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- Just as I predicted Kevin would be the next \#12, Tyler proved me right with his first win. His team is finally playing up to their potential and not having ridiculous matchups every week. Leading up to this week his point differential was -200, which meant he could never catch a break. Excuses aside, seriously what took you so long? It might be too little too late to challenge for a playoff spot, but if Tyler can continue to dig himself out this hole and avoid the Sacko Bowl altogether it would be similar to the Flint Tropics miraculous run to 4th place in the final season of the ABA. Tyler got tropical this week, and looks well poised to stay tropical. Fun fact about Tyler: He's from the same state as the Flint Tropics. Coincidence? I think not. 
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 7)} -- Busted! Matt got beaten good by the Fuzz this week. He has been unable to regain his fine form from the first three weeks with many of his players continuing to look less impressive with each passing week. I do think he is capable of rebounding and getting back into playoff contention via points, but he better act fast. A five game losing streak now puts him at the bottom of the standings with someone cuter than him. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 10)} --  Well Detective Carney cracked the case of the missing points and put up a huge performance this week. They haven't been consistently fed enough donuts and coffee each week, but when the Fuzz put the pedal to the medal in the Crown Vic they have gone all out. You're back on the case rook. Here's your gun and your badge. You're gonna need them to stay in the high speed playoff chase.
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 4)} --  I had always thought Tyler would win some games, but I didn't think it'd be against Connor. Now we know Tyler is Connor's kryptonite as he's never actually beaten him. Having gotten Tyler out of the way though, the Grizzly Bear is well positioned to continue to do what he does best: take pictures of his cats and win regular season fantasy sports match ups. Next week he looks to rebound with another patented Dramatic Late Night Comeback\textsuperscript{TM}.
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 2)} -- For the second week in a row the Squad got hit. Hard. This time by the league wide outbreak of quality starters struggling against resurgent defenses. I know I said the same thing last week, but look for the Squad to get back on track very soon. Unless of course they start to get injured as often as James himself. 
\item \textbf{Atl\'{e}ti Casetrain} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 1)} -- I mean, I know I beat Greg this week, but scoring less than 100 points was not fun. I can't wait for the Vikings D to come back and single-handedly win matchups again. The Casetrain was also greatly affected by the league wide outbreak of quality starters struggling against resurgent defenses this week. So like the Hit Squad, he seems poised to bounce back over the 100 point barrier next week and well into the future. 
\item \textbf{Marty B\dots So LIT} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 6)} -- Kyle continues to receive monster performances from his team and looks well positioned to continue to rack up big W's and be dangerous in the playoffs. Which is why he takes so long to finish up the weekly write-ups. He's far too busy making sure Marty B and the boys are going to salvage his once miserable, pathetic life, I mean season, to once again make it all the way to the championship game. And I think we all know what happens once Kyle makes it to the championship game in fantasy sports. 
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 5)} -- Dono's boys rebounded nicely after a close loss against the Bear last week. With a deep squad and quality bench players, Dono looks to continue his success on the mainland. Unlike when we play basketball, he only seems to be improving and gaining speed with each passing game. His upcoming opponents better hope he starts hitting the umbrella drinks again. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 3)} -- The Fantastic Men remain fantastically consistent. They are currently almost back to full health, but still keep winning week after week. When Dez Bryant comes back and Carlos Hyde gets through whatever he suffered on Sunday, the Fantastic Men are capable of beating every single team every single week. Enjoy your time in the sun, Danny, and make it last. No one has held on to the \#1 spot for consecutive weeks so far. But if you keep this up you will stay right where you are. That notion will be put to the test as Kyle, Connor, James, and Donovan come calling in consecutive weeks hoping to unseat Danny. Who, for the record, is the most likely in the league to be a badass secret superhero defender of justice and peace.

\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 9)} -- Well this week Tyler returned to three places after a brief respite: Snapchat, the L column, and the dreaded \#12 spot on the power rankings. He had a decent week but Kevin outscored him and he's still the only one yet to win two games. Will he ever win two games? Lloyd only knows. (Seriously, I'm sure Sean could tell you.)
\item \textbf{Tallanastee Fatthews} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 12)} -- Oh brother, where art thou? Upper Carolinaz I think. You put up a lot more points this week and overshadowed Tyler by a mathematically discernible amount. But the gap between you and precious Tyler is still as thin as a fried frog leg or whatever they actually eat over there. It must be some weird twin thing because the Casetrain has been atop the leaderboard of cumulative points scored but the KevCaboose has been bringing up the rear for a few weeks now. He still has some serious catching up to do. Which of course is not symbolical of anything related to a sibling rivalry. 
\item \textbf{Cheeto Benito} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- Happy Bday Greg. I wish you nothing but the best this coming year. May all your wildest dreams come true and may your fantasy team finally find a way to escape the rut of mediocrity for consecutive weeks. You're clearly better than Kevin and Tyler, but you seem to be way too comfortable in the 10th spot. Do something with your life young man. Here here!
\item \textbf{A Vengeful Salmon} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 11)} -- Perhaps Kyle and Sean had a little too much fun at the Chance concert, because they both sucked eggs in fantasy this week. Sean, for yet another week, forgot to play his patented fantasy defense and got mauled by a ferocious Connor. As his strength of schedule appears to be increasing, so does his chance of being the Dolphins. Not the equivalent of the Dolphins. Like the actual Dolphins.
\item \textbf{Marty B\dots So LIT} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 3)} -- Back to his disappointing ways, Kyle put up an amount of points we had previously thought only Kevin was capable of producing. It's not week 2 anymore Kyle, you can actually try to win. Where's Marty B to save you now Kyle? 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 7)} -- Trevor had the chance to move above a .500 win percentage this week. But with a little birthday luck the bad guy managed to get away in dramatic fashion and left the police with a lot of explaining to do back at the precinct. Moving forward he has a good team and could certainly challenge for a playoff spot if he can get past the Casetrain this week. Currently, the police movie/TV show embodiment of Trevor's team is, idk, whatever Die Hard is the one with Samuel L. Jackson. Because why not. 
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 8)} -- Matt narrowly edged out the Henrik Sedin of our friend group this week and remains in a good position to nab one of the points positions for the playoffs. I mean, even Barry O gave Matt a shout out this week. We have to assume it's because even el presidente is pleasantly very surprised Matt actually won a game. It's not that Matt doesn't have a good team (check the cumulative points column of the standings), it's just that he sucks at winning. So right now he's like The Godfather, Part III. We know he's been a champ in the past (a la parts I and II) and has once again assembled an all star cast, but this time the story mostly sucks and the movie has been a total dud. Maybe The Godfather, Part IV will be even better? Maybe? 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Pirate Train!} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 4)} -- After the evil league dictator cancelled his blockbuster trade (Sic Semper Tyrannus, am I right or am I right Greg?), the Casetrain still put up an impressive amount of points but was taken out in a tough loss to Trainkiller Donovan Sheridan. Both his losses where along the lines of 115-120, which are always tough pills to swallow (not that trains take pills). The Train still sits atop the leaderboard for points scored though (in case you forgot after half a page). So perhaps “Casetrain don't stop” simply means doesn't stop scoring points, which hasn't happened yet. Nor will it. Ever.
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 6)} -- -Well Connor put his embarrassing loss to Tyler behind him and continued his steady play with a win. Although I get the feeling that he will regret the losses of fantasy standouts Flash Gordon and Future League MVP Kenneth Dixon as the season progresses, he must be pretty stoked he proved Tyler wrong as he didn't drop Flash. It still doesn't avenge his loss to Tyler though.
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 2)} -- I don't feel too bad about losing to Dono this week because he's a good guy and as usual his team put up huge numbers. I knew I should've bought him and Julio Jones plane tickets to Hawai'i last week. 
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 5)} -- Just like Tyler's losing streak, The Squad is back. Always a difficult match up, look out for James to do some serious damage to your sister, I mean fantasy team, moving forward. The Yelp! reviews for the Hit Squad were 2-3 stars for a couple weeks there, but now it's all 5 stars. Look for that to continue. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 1)} -- Until he loses, Danny will stay at number one. But I talked with Danny this week and he said it's funny he's the only one who escapes weekly ridicule from the Power Rankings and the week recaps. Not anymore. Being super busy with school and work and still killing it each week is impressive, but let's not pretend that Danny's team isn't built on the Cowboys model. You can count on the Men to be Fantastic during the regular season and even clinch the occasional divisional title en route to a playoff flameout. Enjoy being number 1 in the rankings for a second straight week, but, just like your beloved Cowboys, you still have to prove you can be fantastic in the playoffs. Maybe a mid-90's revivial is in the works though. If so, look out for the Men under all the confetti.
\end{etaremune}
Have a good week everyone, and don't forget to get informed and hit the voting booths. Only you can prevent forest fires, I mean, dictators.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 8 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{Marty B\dots not quite as lit} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 8)} -- If Kyle's team was an actual I would say they have no momentum and lack confidence. But this is fantasy where anything can happen and dreams come true, especially if your name is Kyle William McNulty. After losing in the championship match of two consecutive fantasy seasons, Kyle must've dreaded the prospect of such a horrible fate befalling him again. And so just like the Carolina Panthers, Kyle has returned this year looking to put last year's disappointing ending to shame with consistent sacko worthy performances. Seriously, what is going on?   
\\[2mm]Well, we got that out of the way. It's just so hard because we want to be nice to Kyle, but his team is garbage. To everyone else ranked 1-11, I might not say it often enough, but you actually have decent teams. 
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- At this point, I'm pretty sure Tyler is just happy to be ranked higher than 12. He did fulfill my prophecy that he would win more than one game this year. He's turned a corner and put his early season sacko-play behind him. And when Tyler does win, it's against a solid team. First Connor, now Dono. You can stop that winning now Tyler. You need to make room for the Casetrain this week.
\item \textbf{Blake Bortles} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- Greg Bortles put up such a solid performance this week that there was only one possible opponent he could lose to: himself. Greg, I mean Kevin, outdid the original Greg. Keep week 11 circled on your calendar, as the brother battle will take place. 
\item \textbf{Gregadelphia Gregs} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 11)} -- Way to shed the KevCaboose label as fast as I gave it you. Your team is actual good now and you could go on a nice little run here at the end. My recommendation for you is to win out or else you're strong late and postseason performances probably won't be in the playoffs for the second straight year. Except week 10 of course. I think it's fair to chalk that up as an L for you already.
\item \textbf{Cooper, Forte, And Sons} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 8)} -- Well Cooper and Forte are probably making lots of new sons this week after putting up lots of points for the Lloyds. It's weird to actually say this seriously, but Sean actually has a decent chance to get into the playoffs this year. He's at 4-4 and his team is actually good right now. And they know have 100\% more Dak. I want to write something underhanded, but right now I can't think of anything. I'll just have Matt post slightly more weird things on Sean's facebook page to make up for it. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Pirate Train!} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 5)} -- I can only use the bye weeks, injuries, and under performances excuse so many times. But seriously I should've gotten more than 4 points from the \#1 TE, \#1 K, and \#1 D/ST. I considered ranking myself even lower, but I know Kyle has been saving up lots of mean things to write about me when I lose. Say what you will Kyle, but I'm still \#1 in cumulative points scored. So that means the Casetrain still isn't stopping. Pr\'{o}xima Parada: Los Playoffs. 
\item \textbf{The Naggers} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 6)} -- It can't be. *Rubs nonexistent glasses* Well I'll be damned. Matt Abraham won back to back games for the first time since last year's playoffs. Which is more of a testament to Kyle's egg laying ability than Matt having actually turned a corner. Or maybe he actually mastered The Lloyd Fantasy Defense™. Either way, his poor record doesn't tell the whole story and he is currently locked in the tight battle to enter the playoffs via points. Currently teams 3-7 are separated by 4.7 points. Omg what a cliffhanger ending to the week. So dramatic. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 7)} -- Well they always told me crime doesn't pay. And this week Trevor busted up the train robbery and sent the Casetrain into the land of the plebeian 5-3 teams. Although he's riding a bit fast and loose with only two real RBs, The Fuzz looks primed to crack the case. This week, Trevor's team's police film/TV show equivalent is Super Troopers.
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 3)} -- Well Halloween really separates the diligent from the careless. And, well, let's just say someone partied a little too hard this weekend and forgot to win his fantasy matchup. I can only imagine your costume was a Hawaiian shirt touting umbrella drinking tourist. As a result you got TOADALLY DOMINATED! But if you get your head out of the sand you'll still march straight through to where your fantasy teams always arrive: a loss in the round 1 of the playoffs, round 2 if you're really lucky. I usually compare Danny to the Cowboys, but historical fantasy records show that you are the true Romo.
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 2)} -- The Squad was cursed in the name of the Lloyd last week. And while the addition of Flash Gordon won't help him points on the board, it sure does suit the bad boy image James is going for. Only a misogynistic country could such a group of delinquents make millions of dollars and put up lots of points week in and week out. Although we must that James also routinely makes those little touches that often go unnoticed but help you win. For example, his team picture is as awesome as it is ever changing. Keep it up Jamesy Poo. And no, Paulette didn't tell me to write that.  
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 4)} -- I know it's weird to move a losing team up the ladder but all the previously 5-2 teams lost last week and those below the now 5-3 teams still need one more week to prove their mettle. Connor's team is super stacked and about to get some potential key performers back. Let's all hope he pays way too much attention to fantasy hockey.
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 1)} -- Damn Danny. Idk how you do it week in and week out. You're officially this year's Kyle. Hopefully you can have a fairy tale ending, unlike Kyle. Next week I'll throw out odds on who will be this year's Blair Walsh. 
\end{etaremune}
Well that it's it for week 8. Don't forget that on Tuesday we vote for important things. Of relevance to our fantasy league, there's a measure to repeal the death penalty in California. So if it passes we'll have a lot less options for the sacko punishment. Also, you can vote to legalize pot. I don't smoke personally, but if you could please help make Trevor's job easier and vote yes, that'd be great. And don't forget to vote for Stephen Reed for Port Commissioner. His qualifications include working for the Carter administration and fathering Brooks Reed. My political commentary ends on a sad note: No, Matt Abraham is not eligible to run for the Office of the President until 2028. Casetrain gets dibs on Secretary of State. Secretary Casetrain Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? If I find out you didn't vote you'll be \#12 on next week's rankings and I'll call you a poopyface who's worse at fantasy sports than Kyle.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 9 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 11)} -- As expected, The Casetrain TOADALLY DOMINATED Tyler this week. Not that it took any sort of effort. I wonder if Tyler's opponents usually feel like Sean does every week. Also, Sammie Coates. Lolz. 
\item \textbf{Cheeto Benito} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- Ironically in a week where Borty Bort did well Greg lost. I guess Greg forgot you need more than one player to actually do something. With no birthday luck set to come around for about 350 days, Greg better hope he's like Gary Johnson to Tyler's Jill Stein: able to put up slightly better results when it really counts. There's always something to be said for not being last.
\item[T9.] \textbf{Gregadelphia Hotcops} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 9)} -- What's that? A tie in the power rankings? Well yes. There are two reasons for the Canadian outcome. 1) We're basically the same person. 2) We play each other this week so it's probably best to settle this tie on the (fantasy) field. Two Mangan enter. One Mangan leave. I hope to outscore Kevin by the same margin next week to show him that 30 seconds older actually means 30 seconds less read good and do other stuff good too, e.g. Fantasy Football. 
\item[T9.] \textbf{Casteraindrick West} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 7)} -- Not a lot to be excited about if you're a passenger on the Casetrain. At least I played Tyler this week. Dominating the first half of the season makes it so I could possibly still squeak into the playoffs with one more win and/or a return to my high scoring ways. But the pack has overtaken the leader and the Casetrain is moving very slowly into a matchup against someone who looks like him. Uh oh. Help me Charmander West! Help me Tom Brady! Help me Tom Cruise!
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 6)} -- Once again Matt did really well and still lost. The anti-Lloyd continues to haunt him. I wonder if it's a curse that has anything to do with Matt have changed his team name with the sole purpose of annoying Sean. At this point he better put up ridiculous points every week in hopes of making the playoffs. Or get Blair Walsh back to break the curse. Maybe Matt will go 108 years without winning a fantasy championship. 2124 isn't for a while. At least he had fun watching the first half of the 49er game.
\item \textbf{Cooper, Forte, and Sons} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 8)} -- Well Sean, you were found right by a jury of your professional athlete peers. Your team is currently better than mine. But you still have some serious work to do to get into the playoffs sitting 2 games back and not close enough in points. Are you the Evan McMullin of our league? Too little too late in Utah. And by Utah I mean the playoffs. If the playoffs were a state, could you think of a better state for them to be? What's that? Oregon? Ha! No way.
\item \textbf{Marty B\dots not quite as lit} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 12)} -- Well Sean isn't the only one who proved me wrong this week. Damn Kyle. Did your white hot rage from striking out in a sport where strikes are supposed to be good fuel a white hot rage inside your fantasy team? Kyle mad! Kyle smash! 
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 2)} -- Connor's team really lived up to its real name this week, a welcome return to tradition for Bear fans everywhere. Despite Matt not sucking eggs for once, his efforts were thwarted by the Dramatic Monday Night Comebacks$^{\text{TM}}$. Those comebacks will be all the more dramatic come playoff time, assuming A Grizzly Bear is one of the 63.654 fantasy teams he currently cares about.
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 4)} -- It was weird that Danny lost this week. It just doesn't happen. Still, his team is stacked. Who'd have guessed Ezequiel Elliot and Jay Ajayi would be such a good 1-2 punch at RB? And his RBs 3-5 are also quite solid. Danny could be a trading partner if you're looking for some always coveted RB depth.
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 4)} -- Dono just keeps on killing it. Idk what else to say. If you thought Sean's mystical Lloyd powers would give Dono an off week, you thought wrong. Dono's trades keep paying off for him. And picking LeGarrette in the 8th round could go down as the steal of the draft.
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 3)} -- Just like we keep ripping on James week after week for his personal life, he keeps showing us up week after week in the one thing we actually care about. His team is good. Which is surprising because, one month ago, in a move that largely went unnoticed James dropped Most Valuable Name winner Boobie Dixon. How he manages to survive with the young and spritely Boobie is amazing. I suppose he's content to keep scoring with the old and saggy kind.
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 5)} -- Guys. Trevor's team is still amazingly good and just keep getting better. When you hear the sirens you best runaway. They gon find you. They gon find you. This week their cop movie/tv show equivalent is True Detective season one. Which is clearly the best. Just like Trevor's team. Maybe we'd have known they were so good earlier in the season if Marty hadn't clipped Ledoux. Expect these guys to be a tough out in the playoffs. Unless they start to play like True Detective season two. In which case, yikes.

\SSs{Casey's Week 11 Power Rankings}
Well after the beloved Casey Teacher's Power Rankings had a bye week during a tumultuous week in both my personal and fantasy football life, they are back and better than ever. Well I haven't written them yet, but it's safe to assume, unlike your pitiful fantasy team, they will be awesome. I'll be including a fun new weekly feature that will cover the playoff chase as well. 

\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- Tyler's team actually isn't bad. Seriously. He just beat Danny. None of us would've predicted that. In fact there's only one problem with Tyler's team: They absolutely sucked eggs during the first 2/3 of the season. Which is why…
\medskip\\Tyler's Path to the Playoffs: This section is a joke. Lolz. Jk. Roflcopter. The playoffs are not gonna happen for Tyler. At least you are decently positioned to avoid the sacko punishment this year. But seriously, when's Tyler gonna get roasted?
\item \textbf{Gregadelphia Kingmakers} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 9)} -- Well he would've moved ahead of his little bro had there been rankings last week. So we must give credit for his victory in the 2016 Wendy's Mangan Brother Bowl™. This week a close win to Kyle puts a lot of wind of his sails and keeps his hopes alive for another week. I had to edit this note because Connor's random points generator, for the first time ever, was incorrect and thought Derek Carr wouldn't score over 20 points. And yes by Connor's random points generator I mean I mostly randomly predicted a number that would be convenient. Kevin, your team's brilliance (or slightly higher brilliance than Kyle's) made my job more difficult this week. Congrats on your Dramatic Mexican Monday Night Comeback$^\text{TM}$.
\medskip\\ Kevin's Vocabulary Building Unlikely Path to the Playoffs: Win out, score an unbelievable amount of points, and pray. But in all honesty you might want to gear up for the anti-playoffs. You'll need a lot of help from the other teams above you. Also, can someone come up with a better phrase for that playoffs in the next two weeks. The Sacko Cup? The Sackley Cup Playoffs? We'll workshop it and come up with something nice. Anyway, your team has certainly been doing much better of late and you could very well have the highest score in the final week once again. But will it be in a meaningful game is the question. 
\item \textbf{Facism comes to America} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 11)} -- Greg might not be making the playoffs this year, but I don't think he cares. He accomplished his true goal of beating his brother-in-law in the 2016 DVD-To-Go McKenna-Ebert Brother Bowl$^\text{TM}$. Good job Greg. Your season might not end with a trophy, but you can sleep soundly knowing you accomplished your goal. Now for the bad news.
[Editor's note: Please read the next section with the guy from Sur La Table in South Park's accent for your reading pleasure.]
\medskip\\ Greg's ``Improbable, but Not Impossable'' Path to the Playoffs: Hello Greg. Please put your hopes here on the table. The playoffs are definitely more attainable than Kevin's or Tyler's (whose cheeks are very pinchable), but you need to win out, score a bunch of points, get Borty Bortable running at full speed, and even still get some help from teams above him collapsing down the stretch. The Sackable Playoffs are preventable for you, Gregable. 
[Place holder for week 12: Next week in this section just insert a meme of the guy from the same episode of South Park who says ``And it's gone!'']
\newpage
\item[T8.] \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 8)} -- Early in the season Matt was the anti-Lloyd, always scoring a lot of points but still being cuckolded by a stronger male. Over the past five weeks things have begun to change. Matt is 2-3 (which by Matt's standards is something to be happy about I suppose) in that span but his point totals have gone way down. I will explain below why that is particularly bad for Matty Poo. Changing his team name back to Gold Team Rules!! appears to only be a cosmetic change as it appears Gold Team currently consists of Current League MVP David Johnson, everyone's favorite TE, Travis Kelce, and a bunch of tempermental New Orleans players. 1.2 points from your K and D/ST isn't gonna cut it. Also, Michael Crabtree played so poorly on Monday Night to really put the final nail in your coffee. He couldn't even catch dysentery if he drank the water.
\medskip\\ Matt's One Dimensional Path to the Playoffs: Evil tyrant, I mean Benevolent Supreme Leader Kyle's new rules for the 6th and final playoff spot give Matt a glimmer of hope. Matt, there is one thing and only one thing you need to do to get into the playoffs. You can't be Jigglypuff and down+B your way out of this one. You NEED to score a ridiculous amount of points over the next two weeks and hope those above you don't. If this week is any indication though, you'll probably come up a fraction of a point short on some play super late in the game. Or at least I hope so.
\item[T8.] \textbf{Mediocre Of All Time} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 6)} -- Well Mediokyle followed up his amazing two week winning streak of 120+ point performances with a very mediocre week. He should probably be disappointed in everyone on his team not named Mariota, McCoy or Murray. OBJ, Kelvin, Eifert and team captain Marty B have to be better. It's almost like this team is playing against its coach. Kyle has positioned himself for a less heartbreaking finish this year though. So if that was your goal, to be MOAT, then well done. If not, bummer broski. Since you both scored basically the same amount of points and lost because of the Raiders on Monday night, you and Matt are tied this week. 
\medskip\\ Kyle's Surprisingly Not Totally Improbable Path to the Playoffs: Maybe I was too harsh on Kyle. It's probably because he continues to be mean to us all by neither doing the writeups nor telling anyone else to do them. Kyle, you gotta let us know if you can't do them so we can fill in for you. And by we I mean Sean and maybe myself. But most certainly Sean. But in all seriousness, get to work. 
Anyway, Kyle you actually have a chance at the playoffs. You can longer win out to get in nor hope other teams help you out. Your only chance is to start actually scoring points again. Right now your 17 points out of the top 6. So get out there and hump those points into submission. As clear cut as the top 6 teams seem to be, you have the best chance at crashing the party. So don't blow it Tina.
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item \textbf{The Lloydsville Express} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 7)} -- Sean sent me a snapchat this weekend of himself at a Sacramento Kings game. To which I replied with a mega burn that D-League games are surprisingly fun to go to. Sorry not sorry Sacramento Kings but you're team has consistently been garbage since you lost to the Lakers in 2002 Conference Finals. What I didn't tell Sean was that his team has a lot in common with Sacramento Kings. Ever since you lost to Matt in the equivalent of the Conference Finals last year your team has consistently disappointed its fan base and merely hoped for mediocrity from opposing teams to stay relevant. So on Thursday when you are giving thanks before you eat way too much turkey, be sure to say you are thankful for all the teams who laid an egg instead of actually playing you (cough cough James). Lloyd knows the Casetrain isn't one of them. You actually had a shot at a Dramatic Mexican Monday Night Comeback™, but for some reason Derek Carr threw it to Stonehands Crabtree way too often and ignored the usually stellar Amari Cooper. 
\medskip\\ Sean's Spiritual Path to the Playoffs: Win out, make up the 94 point differential between you and the sixth highest scoring team, and pray the Lloyd's prayer in hopes that not only does your ridiculous luck mean your opponents will suck over the next two weeks, but also that the teams you need to overtake also suck. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 1)} -- As Connor Reed noted in the group chat, there is a very clear cut top 6 in the three primary ranking systems that we rely upon. Trevor is the little brother of the top 6. He's definitely part of the top 6, but would certainly be the one we would leave behind since James' car only has five seats. Trevor is currently in the now dreaded (thanks to Benevolent Despot Kyle's new rules) 6th place position. However, he is currently fourth in points scored and seems well positioned to take the 6th and final playoff spot. Which brings us to this week's cop movie/tv show equivalent for Officer Trevdog. This week Trevor is everyone in The Departed except Mark Wahlberg right before Alec Baldwin screwed everything up and suspended Marky Mark. Will the story play out the same way for Trevor? He better hope not because, as a result of Baldwin's action and Matt Damon's cunning, everyone except Mark Wahlberg dies. Even Martin Sheen. When Martin Sheen dies in a movie you know someone really screwed up. 
\medskip\\Trevor's Straight and Narrow Path to the Playoffs: Trevor needs to do the fantasy equivalent of not suspending Mark Wahlberg. Don't overreact to your disappointing performance this week and make a drastic change. Your team is good Trevor. Stick to your guns. Is the Beretta still standard issue? 
It's funny that Trevor's path to the playoffs is the exact same as one other person, because that person could very be the one who messes up Trevor's plans, shares the same first name as the actor who benefitted from Alec Baldwin's misstep, and would be a terrible cop, and. Not as bad as Connor, but still pretty damn bad. Trevor shares the same path as Matt: score a ridiculous amount of points to ensure Matt, Kyle, and Sean don't overtake him. There are two scenarios for Trevor here. (1) Be Alec Baldwin, overreact this week and then watch your playoff chances get gunned down. (2) Be Mark Wahlberg and shoot Matt Abraham, I mean Damon, in the face en route to the playoffs. The choice is yours.  
[Editor's note: Dear reader, sorry if you've never seen The Departed and not only did that make no sense, but it also spoiled the whole movie for you. As I am a lazy editor I didn't feel like writing spoiler alert and the beginning. My bad.]
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 2)} -- In fact, James did so bad this week, I think he must actually enjoy getting beat by people named Ebert. No judgment here James; we all have our preferences. But onto more important matters: What happened this week? With the playoffs looming you better get your family affairs sorted out and your head back in the game. Best picture of the week tho.
\medskip\\ James' Ironic Path to the Playoffs: He's \#1 in points scored still and is two games ahead of Trevor, so basically he just shouldn't implode and he'll be in the playoffs. Wouldn't it be kinda funny to watch James miss this playoffs though?
\newpage
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 3)} -- Ben Roethlisberger, like many in the league this week laid a complete egg. How could he not have a monster game against the Browns? With some more saavy line up choices, which you make more often than not, you'll be back on your feet and killing again. If not, you might pull a Connor/Sean and have your bench outscore your starters. With the playoffs looming you better sharpen your knife and get ready to play in the big leagues again. Congrats on your Dramatic Mexican Monday Night Comeback™ thanks to a somehow still unconcussed Latavius Murray.
\medskip\\ Donovan's Clear Cut Path to the Playoffs: Simple. Win one more game and you are in. And then when you get there make smart line up choices or hope for some more of that late game magic you can only seem to muster up in fantasy and not in basketball. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Off the Rails} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 3)} -- After three weeks below 85 points, your worst nightmare has come true: The Casetrain is officially back on the rails. After one of his associates successfully eliminated C.J. Prosise, Thomas Rawls is back to round a solid list of starters where Randall Cobb is actually the weakest link. The train doesn't appear to the clear favorite as the playoffs approach, but he, inshallah, won't be an easy out by any means. Y'all better choo choo out of my way. 
\medskip\\ Casetrain's Two Rail Path to the Playoffs: Two games ahead of Trevor and in the top 6 of points scored, the Casetrain can lock up a playoff spot this week with a win over Mediokyle. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 4)} -- Danny lost to Tyler. Which is the second biggest upset of the month. And the first biggest upset of the month was only allowed to happen because of some archaic law from the 1860's. Maybe that's also where Kyle got his idea for the new rules regarding the 6th playoff spot. Danny and Donovan's losses this week occured for the same reason and can be rectified in the same way: personnel choices. Danny certainly has the talent to go all the way. But will he? 
\medskip\\Danny's Already Completed Path to the Playoffs: Get your favorite beverage out of the fridge. Sit in that favorite spot of yours on the couch. Put your feet up. Grab the remote. Watch everyone else duke it out nervously and try to eliminate each other. You and Tyler actually have one thing in common: you both know exactly where you are headed after week 13.  
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 5)} -- I really like saying Dramatic Late Night Comebacks$^\text{TM}$, and I really like saying Dramatic Mexican Monday Night Comebacks$^\text{TM}$, but if Connor keeps playing the way he does there will be no need for those. He had already thoroughly beaten Trevor before he even woke up on Sunday. As things stand right now, we are looking at a final matchup of Men vs. Bear. Connor might make a bad policeperson, but he is good at fantasy. Unlike his Deadly Accurate Fantasy Predictor$^\text{TM}$, I am giving Connor a greater than 50\% chance of making the playoffs in more than half of the 3 leagues he cares about. 
\medskip\\Connor's Easy Path to the Playoffs: Same as James, just don't completely collapse and you're in there. Connor needs to beat Kyle or Kevin over the next two weeks to punch his tickets to the promised land. But he has enough points scored to almost guarantee a spot no matter what. 
\end{etaremune}
Public Service Announcement: Don't forget there are several games on Thursday this week. Set your rosters accordingly. Unless you're Kyle in which case you can wait til next Thursday to set your roster since you'll too busy doing all those write-ups you've put off.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 12 Power Rankings}
\textbf{\large{The Pretenders Gearing up for the Sackley Cup Playoffs}}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item \textbf{The Lloydsville Express} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 7)} -- All aboard The Lloydsville Express. Next stop: Major sacko contention. The weather forecast at our next stop is a 100\% chance of awkward pictures of Lord Lloyd and Lady Lloyd.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Nope. 
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- Just be happy you're not ranked \#12 this week.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: At no point this year was Tyler ever on the path to the playoffs. How bout those Huskies though?
\item \textbf{Mutated Seabass} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 11)} -- Don't get too excited. You're only ranked ahead of Tyler and Sean because, well, Sean laid an egg this week and Tyler seems to be allergic to winning. How bout those DaWgs though?
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Honestly, Kevin's best bet is to get an early start on his March Madness bracket.
\end{etaremune}
\textbf{\large{The Has Beens Competing for the Final Spot}}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 6)} -- Trevor had himself a fine week. Issued some parking tickets. Cleared a local shopping area of loitering teenagers. Made some sick jokes around the office. He also put up a respectable amount of points in fantasy. The only problem is that Kyle and Matt put up a ridiculous amount of points. This week Trevor is Blade Runner, where the main character needed the bad guy to just kind of stop being invincible in order to save the day.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Buy a super sweet Harrison Ford outfit and hope Matt and Kyle stop scoring so many points. Also, he should try to regain his midseason form which is currently escaping faster than Nicholas Cage's film career.
\item \textbf{Maybe it's Maybelline} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- Greg did just enough to win and it keeps him in the hunt for the playoffs by record. Donovan could've put him out of misery but didn't.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: The best Greg can hope for is finishing in a 7-6 tie with Donovan and/or Casey. I'm assuming points scored is the tiebreaker and that Greg will beat Tyler next week. In which case Greg would need to outscore Dono and/or Casey by over 100 points next week. If that happens just put Dono and I in the sacko bowl immediately.
\item \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW T8)} -- In the sacko bowl preview this week Matt handed Tyler his own ass. As one of the playoff bound teams I can say that I am really hoping you don't end up in the playoffs because your team is genuinely scary right now. Not starting Ingram certainly didn't affect your performance this week, but since you need every single point you can get to overtake Kyle and Trevor, that mistake might actually come back to haunt you.
\medskip\\Path to playoffs: Outscore both Trevor and Kyle by a lot next week and squeak into that sixth and final playoff spot. I'd say your \% chance of making the playoffs is 18 right now. And just like those 18 year old girls, don't give up just because everyone is telling you you can't do it.
\item \textbf{Mediocre Of All Time} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW T8)} -- Jeez. Someone wanted revenge this week. I never thought he would take the new nickname Mediokyle so personally. But I gotta hand it to you Kyle. You beat me good. Like Matt, however, you are perhaps peaking a little bit too late in the fantasy season. Next week should be interesting.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Score a lot more points than Matt and Trevor to keep Matt away from a certain 18 year old, I mean out of the playoffs. Trevor still has the spot held down right now. But you are right on his heels. You are the new Matt Damon.
\end{etaremune}
\textbf{\large{The Final Five Praying for No Injuries}}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 4)} -- Bro, you go a bit too ham at the Thanksgiving table and forget to play fantasy this week? Hopefully the month of December brings out the best in you.
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Don't get outscored by Greg by over 100 points next week.
\item \textbf{Casetrain Thankstrain} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 3)} -- The Train did what it had to this week despite the loss. It was an uneven performance as everyone either went full turkey or laid an egg this week. The train looks kind of threatening entering a likely meaningless game next week. Next stop\dots 
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: \dots don't get outscored by Greg and the next station will be the playoffs.
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 1)} -- Connor has been getting his groove back just in time for the playoffs. We can only hope he gets distracted by his other leagues. Or a literally grizzly bear. Either way, those Dramatic Late Night Comebacks$^\text{TM}$ will be even more dramatic come playoff time.  
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Connor has already punched his ticket to the playoffs. The two first rounds are up for grabs between the Bear, the Squad, and the Men.
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 5)} -- No longer distracted by his family affairs, James did as well as we expect him, too. This week we also learned more about James' professional life. So that's always exciting. Also, when will someone answer the question: Where is James?
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: As sure as Paulette is in the AARP, James is already in the big boy playoffs and will be a part of the ManBearSquad duking it out for a first round bye next week. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 2)} -- Ok Danny. We get it. You're really good. So now that you have a first round bye clinched, why don't you ahead and rest your fantasy starters. Don't wanna be too tired for the playoffs. No that suggestion has nothing to do with who your opponent is next week. What makes you think that?
\medskip\\Path to the playoffs: Just like Tyler was never on the path to the playoffs, Danny never left the path and has been waiting for us at the end for several weeks now. He has to win next week if he wants to assure himself a first round bye. I think we can assume he will do just that.
\end{etaremune}

\noindent Bench of the Week: Greg. Hands down. Kaep alone merits bench of the week but when four of your bench players do better than your starters you win the first ever bench of the week. Unlike most bench of the week winners you actually won your matchup, too. So be pretty stoked about that. Honorable mentions: Matt, Connor, and Kevin.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Week 13 Power Rankings}
\textbf{The Basement Dwellers}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 11)} -- With a chance to finish the season on a high note and his opponent scoring under 70 points, Tyler was primed for a nice finish. But he only managed to score 64.1 points and lost. I think that just about says all there is to be said about Tyler's regular season.
\item \textbf{The Lloydsville Express} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 12)} -- Lloyd got anti-Lloyded this week by the former anti-Lloyd. He definitely had a solid streak in the middle of the season when he was named after a law firm. Other than that he had to rely on this Lloyd luck which failed him. Maybe next year will be better. Maybe not though. 
\item \textbf{Mutated Seabass} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 8)} -- Kevin actually turned it around at the end of year a bit and finished on a high note beating a playoff team. As your little bro I hope to follow in your footsteps this week and do the same.  
\item \textbf{Maybe it's Maybelline} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 10)} -- He didn't outscore Dono and Casey by 100 points in the final week and thus missing his opportunity to better his 3rd place finish from last year. However, Greg was definitely doomed by injuries this season. All things considered, finishing above .500 is a nice feather in his cap. Greg is a saavy fantasy player. Look for a return to podium form next year. 
\end{etaremune}
(There is a 149 point difference between Matt and Kevin, I mean Greg)
\\\textbf{The ``Good Try, Better Luck Next Year'' Teams }
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 9)} -- Trevor you had such a good thing going there and then idk what happened. Ironically the cop movie that most embodies your season is Hot Fuzz. It was really great for the first 2/3 and then ending was pretty meh. 
\item \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 7)} -- 7. Gold Team Rules (LW 7)-Matt seems primed to avoid the sacko after a strong finish to a disappointing season. Although lezbe honest, Matt should've started Mark Ingram in week 12. How funny would it be if he got sacko in his title defense season though? 
\end{etaremune}
\textbf{The Playoff Teams}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 2)} -- Just like he did in the back of Paulette's car this weekend, The Hit Squad is limping into the playoffs. James better ignore his 8:00pm bed time and figure his shit out or he'll get run over by the Casetrain. 
\item \textbf{Mediocre Of All Time} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 6)} -- After faking sick at work to have time to trade away every resident of the great state of Tennessee, Kyle managed to squeak into the playoffs thanks to Trevor's late season regression and the rules that he invented. Naturally our resident mutiny instigator Greg is very suspicious. How badly will he miss everyone he traded away? Knowing Kyle he'll probably lose in the championship game. Again. Saying third time's the charm is always cliche but isn't always true. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain T\"{u}rkletown'da} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 4)} -- The Casetrain appears to be regaining his early season form. Just like his sick burns in Tahoe this summer, the Casetrain won't stop in the playoffs. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 1)} -- The Men got passed up for the \#1 seed this week. But that's what happens when the Casetrain comes to town. Either way they get to chill this week and await Casetrain or Jamesy Poo in the semis. Also, when will Danny share some public comments about fantasy football and/or throw shade at his fellow competitors. We know you don't have school right now mate. 
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 5)} -- Too bad the playoffs didn't start this week. You straight killed it bro. Now you just gotta keep it up. 
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 3)} -- The Bear has a bye week and has been more consistently hungry than Kill. Connor seems primed to make a nice little run this December.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Playoffs Week 1 Power Rankings}
\textbf{The Sackley Cup Playoffs}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item \textbf{The Lloydsville Express} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 11)} -- Remember how badly Dono did when he was in Hawai'i with his main squeeze? Well let's just say Sean's in Europe with his boo thang. I think the road to Pleasuretown and the Sacko Bowl might be one in the same. Or maybe Sean just doesn't fear spray tans, roasting, and comedy nights where we write the jokes. Either way, he just lost to Tyler and looks poised for more. 
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 12)} -- At least you're better than Sean. But you still have prove you are not destined for last place.
\item \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 7)} -- Gold Team certainly didn't rule this week. You may have only missed out on the playoffs by 4 points, but this week I think your performance showed us which playoff bracket your team belongs in.  
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 8)} -- At least you're better than Matt. Although with all the promise you showed in the regular season, it's still a big disappointment for all your fans to see the Fuzz finish this way.
\item \textbf{Kevin Mangan} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 9)} -- You may have missed out on early escape from the sacko bowl, but your team is poised to avoid punishment as your remaining opponents are generally bad. You on the other hand are not. 
\item \textbf{Gregadelphia Gregs} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 10)} -- For the second year in a row, Kevin played his best football in the Sackley Cup Playoffs and is now immune from punishment. If only he could figure out the formula to regular season success. Maybe next year. 
\end{etaremune}
\textbf{The Big Boy Playoffs}
\begin{etaremune}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item \textbf{h-IT'S-q-A-ud WONDERFUL LIFE} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 6)} -- Once the hottest team in the land, the Hit Squad finishes a disappointing end to regular season with an early playoff exit. Better luck next season.
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 2)} -- The most painful elimination of the week, however, goes to Donovan. Despite putting up huge numbers he was outdone by playoff darling (and an all around darling) Kyle. Donovan easily outscored the other playoff matchup, but just got plain unlucky. Donovan appears to have found the formula for success and looks primed to go even farther next season. 
\item \textbf{Casetrains, Planes, and Automobiles} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 4)} -- Good thing James did his best Squidward impression and really sucked eggs this week. The Casetrain survives Eli Manning's pooping of the bed and Devonta Freeman's week off. The train moves on to a semi-final with A Grizzly Bear.  
\item \textbf{Remember the Titans} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 5)} -- The Russian hackers appear to have done a little bit more than rig the election. Either way, Kyle showed he belongs in the playoffs and looks poised to give the Fantastic Men all he can handle. He does have a big decision to make at QB this week give Tyrod and Brady's polarizing matchups. 
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 3)} -- I hope the Men enjoyed a Fantastic week off. They're back in action this week. 
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 1)} -- Someone forgot to tell Le'Veon about the week off. 
\end{etaremune}
\bigskip\textbf{Semi-final predictions:}
\\The Grizz is just too dangerous. Even though the Casetrain looks likely to rebound this week, I think we all start to see this week why you silly people shouldn't have traded Connor all of your good RBs. 
\bigskip\\ I keep wavering back and forth on who will win this matchup. The Men will once again be Fantastically Consistent, but in the end I think Kyle has destiny on his side and will squeak past Danny to move on to his rightful place in the fantasy world: 2nd place.
\bigskip\\\textbf{Bench of the Week:}
\noindent The Fantasy Manager Formerly Known as Greg. When it all mattered most, how could not trust your ride or die Bort? That and the decision to leave Marty B on the bench will haunt him as he continues to move closer to the Sacko Bowl.

\newpage
\SSs{Casey's Playoffs Week 2 Power Rankings}
\begin{etaremune}
\item \textbf{Life is Impermanent} -- \textit{Greg Ebert (LW 8)} -- ``You may have missed out on early escape from the sacko bowl, but your team is poised to avoid punishment as your remaining opponents are generally bad. You on the other hand are not.'' I wrote that last week. Never have been so wrong. Your team is garbage and you were Bortely dominated this week by Tyler. Try to grab onto a tree branch to stop your freefall or you risk losing to a European lover boy whose list of pet peeves now include Todd Gurley. Although we do all have some sympathy for you since your first three picks essentially died, that's loser talk because in fantasy baseball Casey's first two picks died and he still won the whole thing. 
\item \textbf{The Lloydsville Express} -- \textit{Sean Musser (LW 12)} -- Speaking of Europe, Sean better not succumb to jetlag and Guiness hangovers this week. There is too much at stake here. Put your head on straight son. You've got a sacko to avoid. Last year Kevin won the sacko by scoring the most points in the league that week. But you, on the other hand, need to play to your strengths: get that Lloyd magic working again and ensure Greg scores 20 points next week.
\item \textbf{TOADAL DOMINATION} -- \textit{Tyler Edwards (LW 11)} -- See this is why the death penalty is a bad idea. All people are redeemable and capable of making something of themselves even if they were criminally bad and sucked serious eggs in the regular season. And I must say I was wrong. We all were. You are not as we say in Spain, el doble saco. I hope you are greatly entertained by Greg and Sean nervously duking it out this week to avoid their punishment. 
\item \textbf{Gold Team Rules!!} -- \textit{Matt Abraham (LW 10)} -- With a strong performance this week you avoided going from hero to zero. Congrats. At least you ended on a positive note. But seriously you should've started Mark Ingram in week 12. 
\item \textbf{LloydGreg EbertMusser} -- \textit{Kevin Mangan (LW 7)} -- Your season ended last week so it didn't really matter that you lost to Trevor. I think the biggest surprise of the season is that you didn't finish with 4 top 10 QBs on your roster. 
\item \textbf{Hot Fuzz} -- \textit{Trevor Carney (LW 9)} -- 135 points? The Trevor we all once feared has returned a day late and dollar short. This week you are Super Troopers: you solved the case after you lost your job. But at least you'll get a new team next year. Also, I can only assume you chugged a bottle of syrup at a diner while on duty this week. Safe assumption.
\item \textbf{Kill or Be killed} -- \textit{Donovan Sheridan (LW 5)} -- Well you just missed out on 5th place. But hey back to back years in the playoffs in a competitive league is nothing to be ashamed of. 
\item \textbf{Hit Squad} -- \textit{James McKenna (LW 6)} -- Weirdly enough, this year James' team didn't get super injured and unlucky like he does in real life. 5th place is a respectable finish. 
\item \textbf{Casetrain Matador de Osos} -- \textit{Casey Mangan (LW 4)} -- Unfortunately the Casetrain ran out of fuel before the final destination and a match against Master Hand. I mean Kyle. Actually Kyle could also be a Master Hand since his girlfriend doesn't live close by.
\item \textbf{Fantastic Men} -- \textit{Danny Noonan (LW 2)} -- A rough ending to a great season from Danny. Is this a sign of things to come for the Cowboys as well?
\item \textbf{A Grizzly Bear} -- \textit{Connor Reed (LW 2)} -- Connor is like Craig from the Pandemic episode of South Park. Destined to defeat the evil guinea pig menace and remain entirely nonchalant the whole time. Okay maybe that was a bad example, but I do like to envision Kyle as an evil guinea pig menace because he did such a shithouse job on doing writeups this year. I mean, at least delegate them to Sean or me. Anyway, Connor has a good team and will probably, to the surprise of no one, become our league champion in football en route to winning hockey as well.
\item \textbf{Remember the Titans} -- \textit{Kyle McNulty (LW 3)} -- 1. Remember the Titans (LW 3)-Like I said earlier, Kyle has destiny on his side. We all knew deep down he would make it to this point. And we all know what will happen next week. It's his destiny. 
\end{etaremune}

\\Sean will call upon the name of the Lloyd who will smote Greg's entire team, starting with Blake Bortles-Ebert-McKenna. Sean 25, Greg 20
