	Whoa. Hit the jug and flew up and over Conor. Great spotting from him and soft dirt prevented an injury after one of the most exciting falls I've ever taken and somehow Caitlin got it on video. I left a nice human sized crater in the dirt. Maybe one day I'll go back and try again."

	Slapped the hold once surprisingly. Had taken a couple months off climbing but surprisingly felt okay on crimps and skin didn't hurt too bad. Who knows why.

Session #2 on 2021-05-03 at 11:30:00. 10 attempts, over 60 minutes. 
	Slapped the hold a couple times before busting off and opening my knuckle. I don't think I can do this in the hot weather.

	Felt really slippery even though it was super cold. Also realized it's not over after the first move, matching or getting your foot up to go left is going to be hard as well."

	Man...I didn't expect this to be as spooky as it was. I don't know if the new landing zone makes it better or worse, but the tree is  really bothersome to me. I did the first move a couple times, but haven't quite figured out the match. I tried starting from both hands on the lip off the tree, but couldn't commit to doing any moves even with the tree padded up. Maybe this one will have to wait until I'm waaaay stronger or something."

Session #1 on 2022-12-31 at 15:00:00. 15 attempts, over 60 minutes. 
	Never did the first move, but did it (to a safe drop off point) from a move in. This is VERY crimpy and sharp. Caitlin could do the first move but not the 3rd(?) move, so combined we had a team send. Conor gave up, but then got bored and gritted his teeth and did it. It still looked hard.

In lighter news, Casey took my first witnessed Hueco dump. We collected all the plastic bags we could find and off he went, only to return after relieving himself alerting us to the fact that he couldn't find any of the bags other than the bag that the toilet paper was in. He took C^2's saucy sandwich bag for a second layer, and made the (smart) decision to sacrifice his tupperware for extra protection.

When we left the area he realized the bags were in his jacket pocket which he had removed prior to pooping. A comedy in three parts."

Session #1 on 2022-02-20 at 12:00:00. 10 attempts, over 30 minutes. 
	Couldn't figure out how to do the punchy undercling move, felt really far.

Session #2 on 2022-02-24 at 12:00:00. 10 attempts, over 60 minutes. 
	I thought this innovative heel beta I saw a video on was going to be the difference. It wasn't. Underclings are still way too hard. My down jacket did blow away in a strong gust of wind though so that added some excitement. I think a gust whipped through the cave and rocketed out; my jacket flew up and out of the cave, probably like 40-70 feet up in the air. I thought I was going to have to spend the rest of the day looking for it, but luckily I found it after maybe 25 (stressful) minutes. It had blown maybe ~250 feet east and I audibly shrieked when I found it. Probably happier to find the jacket than to do any climb, so I'll take it."

	Well I did what I thought was the crux, and then had no idea what to do after so I guess that's something. Maybe wearing shoes that had a more precise heel could have been helpful, but who knows."

	After doing Flow Stone and checking this out this morning, I went home and watched some videos of this to gauge whether it would be worth going back to. After sitting around for a few hours the weather had cooled down I couldn't think of anything else to do so I drove back out there to give it some goes. It was decently scary trying to figure out the mid/top section with 2 pads, but almost doable. However it was pretty sharp, and harder than I thought, so overall a 2.5/5 experience. Would consider going back, but probably not solo."
