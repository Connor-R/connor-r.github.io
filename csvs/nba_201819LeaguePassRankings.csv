Team_Name,Conference,Grade,Justification
"""Atlanta Hawks""","""Eastern""",1.5,"""development of John Collins/Kevin Huerter/Taurean Prince; does Trae Young provide any value outside of PNR offense?; BAZEMORE"""
"""Boston Celtics""","""Eastern""",6.0,"""stylistically pleasing; Smart/Brown/Hayward/Tatum/Horford might be the most defensively versatile lineup in the league"""
"""Brooklyn Nets""","""Eastern""",6.5,"""I don't think they're going to be that bad!; strong depth"""
"""Charlotte Hornets""","""Eastern""",1.5,"""Kemba Walker and Nic Batum are the only reasons this isn't a straight up 1"""
"""Chicago Bulls""","""Eastern""",4.0,"""Wendall Carter Jr. is one of my favorite rookies this year; Lauri Markkanen was one of my favorites rookies last year; Kris Dunn and Jabari Parker are two of my least favorite young players; Zach LaVine confuses me"""
"""Cleveland Cavaliers""","""Eastern""",2.5,"""they're going to be relatively boring, but I think the 7th seed is a realistically possibility since they have a lot of NBA caliber players, which not all the teams in the East feature; I hope JR Smith averages 15 FGA per game"""
"""Dallas Mavericks""","""Western""",6.0,"""Luka Doncic is worth 5 points by himself, but the rest of the team is relatively boring; Dwight Powell is quietly very entertaining"""
"""Denver Nuggets""","""Western""",8.0,"""Nikola Jokic might be my favorite player to watch, and Jamal Murray/Gary Harris/Paul Millsap all rank highly as well; why did they give Mason Plumlee so much money?"""
"""Detroit Pistons""","""Eastern""",1.0,"""unless Dwayne Casey coaches out of his mind, an offense centered around Jackson/Griffin/Drummond is have no space and be relatively boring"""
"""Golden State Warriors""","""Western""",5.0,"""who plays between Bell/Jones/Looney; integration of DeMarcus Cousins, is Jacob Evans an NBA player this year?; where is Patrick McCaw?; how much do any of the Big 6 (Curry/Thompson/Durant/Green/Iguodala/Livingston) try during the regular season?"""
"""Houston Rockets""","""Western""",6.0,"""they would be at least a 7.5 without Melo and MCW; Marquese Chriss has potential to be the next JaVale McGee of watchability; maybe this is the year my Zhou Qi draft day rankings start to show some value"""
"""Indiana Pacers""","""Eastern""",6.0,"""hated their last 2 drafts with Holiday and Leaf; don't like Collison or Thad Young much, but CoJo/Dipo/Bogdanovic/Turner are personal cheeseballs"""
"""Los Angeles Clippers""","""Western""",3.0,"""tuning in for the PG (Beverely/Teodosic/Shai G-A) and backup C (Boban/Montrezl) minutes, if all 5 are every on the floor at the same time I might faint;"""
"""Los Angeles Lakers""","""Western""",8.0,"""Lonzo Ball is likely my 2nd favorite player to watch (behind Jokic), his passing, help defense, and cutting are unreal; they're be at least a 9 without Rondo and Michael Beasley; I'm high on Josh Hart and Alex Caruso"""
"""Memphis Grizzlies""","""Western""",3.5,"""really sad that this is where Jaren Jackson Jr. ended up, they would be a 2 at best without him"""
"""Miami Heat""","""Eastern""",8.0,"""""Jazz East""; stylistically pleasing; depth; love Josh Richardson, Bam Adebayo, and Justise Winslow"""
"""Milwaukee Bucks""","""Eastern""",7.5,"""Giannis Antetokounmppo is an automatic 5 points; Brogdon, Middleton, and Ilyasova are favorites; Eric Bledsoe and Thon Maker confuse me"""
"""Minnesota Timberwolves""","""Western""",3.0,"""wish Tyus Jones was appreciated more, he's better than Teague; Josh Okogie was a draft favorite"""
"""New Orleans Pelicans""","""Western""",4.0,"""weird situation where 3 of the best 4 players all want to play the 4 (unless AD finally gives in and realizes he's a 5); Jahlil Okafor is becoming a 20/10 threat now that he's vegan and Elfrid Payton is going to shoot 40% from 3 now that he cut his hair (sarcasm); AD, Mirotic, and Jrue Holiday save the grade from slipping into the bottom echelon"""
"""New York Knicks""","""Eastern""",1.0,"""it's bad when the players I'm most interested in are draft busts from 4 years ago; I hope they don't mess up the development of Knox and Ntilikina, they could be 3/5 of a good team with Porzingod one day"""
"""Oklahoma City Thunder""","""Western""",5.0,"""extremely stylistically dis-pleasing; tons of players I like (Roberson/Abrines/Luwawu-Cabarrot/George/Patterson/Adams/Noel); RWB/Jerami Grant are two of the most explosive athletes at their positions"""
"""Orlando Magic""","""Eastern""",1.5,"""Jonathan Isaac (and a little bit of Aaron Gordon) keeps them from being a 1; Mo Bamba *could* be extremely fun"""
"""Philadelphia 76ers""","""Eastern""",9.0,"""only thing keeping them from going higher is the hype train surrounding them; Robert Covington is a favorite; Zhaire Smith is one of my favorite rookies; Simmons is one of a few players in the league with all-time great vision (LeBron James, Lonzo Ball, Luka Doncic)"""
"""Phoenix Suns""","""Western""",2.0,"""I really want Dragan Bender to be good (him and Zhou Qi are maybe my two biggest draft over-rankings so far); the Mikal Bridges trade will likely go down as a franchise altering one (in a bad way)"""
"""Portland Trail Blazers""","""Western""",5.0,"""Lillard time may be the single most exciting time during regular season NBA basketball;"""
"""Sacramento Kings""","""Western""",2.5,"""I like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Willie Cauley-Stein quite a bit; how do they handle frontcourt minutes between the young (WCS/Bagley/Labissiere/Giles) and old (Randolph/Kougos/Bjelica)"""
"""San Antonio Spurs""","""Western""",2.0,"""oh how the mighty have fallen; the late 00's/early 10's Spurs teams were true 10s; I'm disinterested in watching DDR/Gay/Aldridge isolate and shoot 16 foot jump shots; Popovich's greatest accomplishment may be making this team watchable"""
"""Toronto Raptors""","""Eastern""",8.5,"""tons of favorite players (Lowry/Green/Leonard/VanVleet/Anunoby/Siakam); early viewings of Nick Nurse's coaching style give me hope they could be extremely fun"""
"""Utah Jazz""","""Western""",9.5,"""stylistically pleasing; depth; Rubio, Exum, Mitchell, Ingles, Crowder, Gobert, Udoh are all favorites; would be a 10 if they didn't botch the Grayson Allen pick"""
"""Washington Wizards""","""Eastern""",3.0,"""John Wall is a more pleasing (to me) version of RWB; the junior wings (Otto Porter Jr., Kelly Oubre Jr., Troy Brown Jr.) are fun and I want to see lineups with all 3; Wizards of years past have had the worst end-of-game offensive strategy in the league"""
