1,2013-07-20,"""Patrick D (@FTFs_SnarkSD)""","""Sports(Hockey)""","""Twitter""",,,"""The Cronin(sp?) article brought an interesting question? Is there such a thing as ""quality"" possession? The short answer is; at the nhl level, teams cannot sustain a higher quality possession game, relative to other teams. I think this phenomena is similar to goaltending talent, but for coaching. We don't observe a significant difference, because the overall high quality washes any difference in potential difference in skill. Coaches make sure to squeeze every ounce of quality out of possession. The high level washes out any potential advantage."""

I won't be ""training"" him at all, really. Here are the rules I'd laid out:    1) It must be his idea. No dragging him to the park to hit unwanted batting practice or throw or field grounders. If he wants to do it, I will make myself available as best as possible.    2) It has to be fun. If it's not fun, we're not doing it. No reason to hate the game at age 9 because your father makes the game terrible.    3) Everything will be done at full intensity and speed, with errors/mistakes not counting. Praise will be heaped on him for swinging out of his shoes and throwing a ball as far as possible 60 degrees away from the target. There is a limited time in youth athletes to develop speed, power, and intent. Sacrificing those for present-day success is the fastest track to stalling out later in life. It also teaches poor life lessons; namely that passion is something that should be routinely derailed for what's important right now - a clear lack of understanding how delayed gratification plays a role in learning, making, and doing.    3a) I will rarely throw balls overhand at him at anything less than 80% of my arm strength (admittedly nothing special, but to a 3 year old, pretty fast). I don't throw balls and nail him in the face with a 65 MPH heater of course, but I throw them against a fence/tarp/net comfortably away from his body, which he picks up and then hits/throws back. I never want him to associate overhand throwing with ""easing it in there."" Underhand throws for field work is fine, overhand is not.    4) He has to bat left and throw right. (Kidding, but he already grips the bat left-handed. Why ruin a good thing?)"""

Is it as simple as ""no pretty goals in the playoffs - you've gotta work harder""? Probably not. And obviously, the competition is better in playoffs. But one difference no one really talks about between regular season and playoffs is coaching and, specifically, opponent-specific preparation. During the regular season, there's very limited practice time and almost no opponent-specific prep. This isn't the NFL, where you get a week. So you can win a lot of games in the regular season on a skill advantage and a novel wrinkle on your PP or what have you. In the playoffs, however, it's a lot of team-specific prep. So it stands to reason that better coaches (and staffs) fare better. And that's part of why you saw the Leafs (Babcock) give the Caps some trouble early. Ditto PIT, to an extent. But Caps adjusted in both. Anyway, people talk about the *what* of the difference between regular season and playoffs (in vague terms), but not so much the *why* of it. And I think a big piece of that *why* that people miss is the difference in opponent specific prep. Might be biggest area of coaching impact."""

276,2017-11-30,"""Jason Ochart (@JasonOchart)""","""Sports(Baseball)""","""Twitter""",,,"""An interesting thing happened the other day. Our hitters were hitting 88 mph cutters from the pitching machine. A pro hitter was hitting very well, so I told him ""well done! You're hitting those cutters very well, I'm impressed"" He responded with ""oh those are cutters?"" He didn't realize he was hitting cutters. His next round was pure yip salad, he swung and missed half the pitches, was consistently late and had a terrible round. It didn't make any sense to me, and it's been on my mind. My thoughts are that his brain was able to couple an action(swing) with the perception (incoming pitch) naturally just because he is an elite athlete and mover. This happened subconsciously, as is ideal. But once he was made aware of the pitch, he began to deliberately think about swinging to where a cutter moves. He began to try to override his motor system's method of attaching a movement solution to a movement problem by consciously making the adjustment perceived to be needed. Some of the best hitters I've ever coached have no idea what pitch they hit after at bats. Or when I'd tell them that I picked the pitcher's pitches and will give them verbals, they say they don't want them. It used to confuse me a lot. So I guess the take away is that we have to be careful about where we direct the attention of a hitter. If a guy is flowing and hitting well, the best thing to do is leave them alone. Saying nothing is often the best thing to say. As a matter of fact, telling a hitter what he's doing well (especially physically) when they are doing well is likely a good way to screw them up if they aren't capable or trained to deal with that information productively."""

Not going to lie, I'm pretty sad at the state of the league today. To borrow again from Gartner, 3.5 years ago, we hit the ""Peak of Inflated Expectations"". We are now massively in the ""Trough of Disillusionment"", and I don't see us digging out for a while. I'm hopelessly biased because he's a long time friend of mine, but man, Sunny Mehta is a top tier NHL GM, and instead of seeing him work his magic, we watch a bunch of guys whose dads were famous stumble around like Hans Moleman's kids. We still have 27 GMs who are there because they played pro or their dads are famous. The other three: Lou (no longer an outsider) and the mysterious John Chayka and Jeff Gorton. In today's NHL, any team that spends to cap should be a 93-point team. Literally, VGK, assembled from useless scraps, is that good. So you can make BizNasty2.0 your GM and he'll probably make the playoffs if you give him that much cash. In fact, no GM has really shown any deterministic talent for building a good team. Every GM has either relied on good drafting after being bad, or great legacies. What I find unfortunate, is that nobody has had the guts to break through this. There is so much untapped value in the NHL, you can find a GM who will win the cup at the salary floor. You can't do that by picking up guys who have the aura of being a 2nd line center and who coach knew in Moose Jaw. It's a recipe for being no better than anybody else.     I thought this was worth addressing. Steve Yzerman got his job because he's Steve Yzerman, Hall of Fame hockey player.

PUCKS is a video system published by a company called Sydex. The genius of the system is twofold. First, you can look at stuff based on events from game sheets. I find what happens after faceoffs fascinating. I was interested in this back before I went to work for the Oilers. I identified teams that were good in certain situations and then I'd work through video from Gamecentre, trying to identify tactics. It was a nightmare to do. With PUCKS, you can say ""OK, SJ gets great results after DZW - what is Todd McLellan up to?"" Then you can sit down and watch his team win 600 defensive zone faceoffs and pick out as much stuff as humanly possible and mark the best clips to show to a coach.     So the first great thing about PUCKS is that it's tied into RTSS. If you can identify situations that lead to certain results with data, you can sit down and just watch that scenario over and over and over with video. Stuff jumps off the screen when you do that, in my experience. The second great thing is that you can mark whatever you want on the video. So a video coach can sit down and watch the game and mark every goalie touch or whatever. @jprutherford had a great story about this recently. It makes collecting clips of something much easier. So if you're interested in something that isn't captured by RTSS, you can capture it yourself by marking the instances when it occurs on PUCKS. I will tell you: the first time I saw PUCKS, my mind was blown. And I've missed it every day I haven't had it, never more than when I look at video for something.

After all, you could dive into the inside view and draw conclusions, then turn to the outside view. Wouldn't that work as well? Unfortunately, no, it probably wouldn't. The reason is a basic psychological concept called anchoring. When we make estimates, we tend to start with some number and adjust. The number we start with is called the anchor. It's important because we typically underadjust, which means a bad anchor can easily produce a bad estimate. And it's astonishingly easy to settle on a bad anchor. In classic experiments, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky showed you could influence people's judgment merely by exposing them to a number-any number, even one that is obviously meaningless, like one randomly selected by the spin of a wheel.10 So a forecaster who starts by diving into the inside view risks being swayed by a number that may have little or no meaning.

If you need something to do your job better, buy it. I guess if it costs a lot, ask. If it doesn't, and you can justify it, buy it.    - Ability to choose R&D and independent projects mostly at-will as long as they further the company's goals.    - A research stipend for any on-floor trainer or R&D member to spend, no-questions-asked, on anything they think that will improve their careers at Driveline Baseball and beyond. Examples include: Postural Restoration Institution certification, Graston/FAKTR certification, trips to Atlanta to attend a sports science course on injuries, and trips to ALTIS in Phoenix to learn how Olympic sprinters are trained.

There are still players whose imagination and creativity capture the Soviet spirit -- Johnny Gaudreau in Calgary, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews in Chicago just to name a few. However, they are becoming exceptions to the rule. Many young players who are intelligent and can see the game four moves ahead are not valued. They're told ""simple, simple, simple.""    That mentality is kind of boring. Nobody wants to get fired. Nobody wants to get sent down to the minors. If you look at the coaches in Juniors and minor league hockey, many of them were not skill players. It's a lot of former enforcers and grinders who take these coaching jobs. Naturally, they tell their players to be just like them. Their players are 17, 18 years old -- younger than I was when I joined the Red Army team. Say what you want about the Whiplash mentality (or the Soviet mentality), but if coaches are going to push kids at that age, why are they pushing them to play a simple game?

The problem that gets overlooked is the thought that ""hockey is too complex to be modeled"" or ""these teams never won the title"". People love to think that our thoughts and ideas are uber-complex - but they really aren't.    Google ""systems biology"" or ""bioinformatics"". In scientific research we use statistics every day to model thousands of molecules and other moving parts in cancer and other diseases whose functions/roles are much more seemingly random than a hockey game, so tell me again how modeling 10 players in hockey has too many moving parts? Just because most people don't have the desire (and in some cases, the intellectual power) to learn the tools necessary to figure out how to do this doesn't mean that we should just assume that the more ""human"" approach is the correct one. Human nature is to dismiss approaches that we don't understand.    Scientists have developed drug targets and drugs based off these models - some are very effective, but other may only work in 45% of the people treated. So it seems that with these drugs, since they aren't ""championship material"" (i.e. 100% effective), we should dismiss them completely right?:sarcasm:    I get that real life is different (and obviously much less important) than sports, but the models (if done correctly) play out similarly in terms of applicability in many ways. Because sports are entertainment, nobody is forcing you to pay attention to stats if it takes away your enjoyment of hockey's beauty. If people choose to evaluate the games they watch in a more advanced way, why should those who don't feel the need to bash them and denounce their methods (and yes it should go in both directions)?    The ""eye test"" used to be the way to find molecules involved in disease. Over the course of 20+ years, very few were discovered (leading to even fewer treatments) and many human biases were introduced, such as the need to confirm one's beliefs (similar to hockey), money invested, and stature (promotions, Nobel Prize, publication count, etc.). Since statistical approaches started becoming more commonplace in biology (about 15 years ago), hundreds of new molecules (and data types) were discovered absent of bias. Granted, there are many false positives that don't tell us anything, but the true positives are the important discoveries. Just because stats may provide some incorrect interpretations doesn't mean that the correct ones it does provide won't tell us what we want to know (and in a much better way than the eye test)."""

It's well known that a player born in the last three months of the year has a distinct advantage over his draft classmates, due to the Entry Draft cutoff date of September 15. A first-time draft-eligible player born in October, November or December has essentially had an additional year of development over one born in March, for example, since minor hockey generally uses birth year only to group players into divisions.    But how much of a difference does it really make? Quite a difference, actually.    To illustrate the dramatic effect that a player's birth month can have on his projection, let's look at a hypothetical forward from the OHL, a prospect for the 2011 Entry Draft. He plays for an average OHL team, is of average size (6'1"") and recorded the following statistics: 40 goals, 60 assists and 60 penalty minutes in 60 games. The Projectinator sees this player being worth an average of 8.1 GVT in his prime years, making him a very good prospect; however the projection ranges from 6.0 GVT to 9.9 GVT, depending on when he was born.    The Effect of Birth Month on Projected GVT    Birth Month		Projected GVT  September 1992	6.0  October 1992		6.3  November 1992		6.6  December 1992		7.0  January 1993		7.7  February 1993		8.0  March 1993		8.3  April 1993			8.7  May 1993			8.8  June 1993			8.9  July 1993			9.1  August 1993		9.5  September 1993	9.9    If there's a factor that can cause a swing of as much as 25% in a player's projected value, you'd better be sure to consider that factor. Birth month is a terribly important thing to consider when you're drafting a player. It can make the difference between a great prospect and a merely very good one."""

Any time somebody is anti-analytics they'll always look for the outlier, the example or two that are somehow meant to ""disprove"" the usefulness of a metric, or of analytics as a whole.    It's a level of scrutiny we apply to almost nothing else in life, and certainly not in this sport. Nobody is going to take a scouts draft board and, if he gets one projection wrong, say that scouting has no place in the league. Yet that's what feels like happens when we talk about analytics.    I've frequently said that those who believe in using analytics are more skeptical towards numbers than those who don't. There is nobody in the league, or who covers the league, that doesn't use numbers to some degree, whether that's field goal percentage or true shooting percentage, whether that's rebounds per game or rebounding percentage, or whether that's points per game or RPM or warp projections.    But where some people have settled on the well-traveled metrics like per-game stats, practitioners of analytics (the good ones, at least) are keenly aware of the weaknesses in the numbers they use, and are always on the lookout for ways to improve upon those weaknesses.    And if we're not looking to constantly improve our methods of evaluation, whether that's traditional scouting or with statistical tools, then what's the point?"""

We now have examples that if done correctly, the opposite is true.    EXAMPLE:   Last season, 32% of the Bucks' true shots (FGA or trips to the line) were from 2s away from the hoop. That percentage has dropped to 15% this season. In exchange, the Bucks are seeing significant increases in shot rates at the hoop and above-the-break. And with the changes, the Bucks' efficiency above the break and at the hoop have improved.    Part of the improvement is due to new personnel (e.g. Brook Lopez) that are better-suited for Budenholzer's desired shot selection. But also, spacing the floor with 3-point threats is proven to open up more space and create efficient looks around the hoop. And when a team is that efficient and attacking that often at the hoop, opposing defenses will collapse/help, leaving shooters open for catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts.    Overall, the Bucks have improved from 1.14 pts per shot last season to 1.19 this season (or 5 points per 100 shots). That's a significant improvement."""

The answer is that it strongly depends on the makeup of the kid, the athletic profile of the player, the opportunities they'll have if they don't go to school, and the bonus money.    Some thoughts of mine in the thread below:    I am of the opinion that basically all non-top-100 position players should go to college unless their grades / aptitude for school is so bad that it's a non-starter. The quality of pitching and defense in the minor leagues is insane. The jump from HS to pro as a bat is crazy.    Pitchers are a different story. They must have strong makeup to deal with long days on the road and growing up around the pro game, which is not for everyone. Development isn't equal amongst the 30 teams, either. Half the orgs are probably not worth going to as a HS arm for low $.    A HS arm that gets paid big $ gets better opportunities, but is usually babied too much (as Scherzer pointed out), which is bad for their future career and clubhouse chemistry, unfortunately (bonus baby stigma).    Often the best route to go is Junior College ball where you retain draft AND four-year eligibility, but the MLB draft has historically been biased against JC players. This has changed recently with Jackson Rutledge and Nate Pearson, but still many orgs downgrade JC players.    Ultimately it depends on the makeup of the kid, their present abilities, and aptitude for school.    As a rule of thumb, position players should almost always go to college, while I think pitchers have a bit more flexibility in their decision making process.    Also, the concept that a HS player gets to FA faster if they reach MLB quicker than a college player is such a remote chance that it is not worth considering. It matters for Mike Trout and Bryce Harper, but the likelihood it matters for any single HS kid is negligible."""

Millions of people screened out of jobs based on elaborate random number generators.    @TheWrongNoel says:  A friend of mine has been trying to hire a new employee for her department in a medium-sized org. After advertising several times with few applicants, and a couple of rounds of interviews, the new employee is less than great. Then she discovered there were other applicants.     Among them was someone she knows personally, who has a spot-on CV, loads of experience, lives locally and would be the perfect person for the job. So she goes to HR to ask why that application was never sent through to her dept. The answer ? she didn't score well.     Score well on what? It turns out the HR dept adopted screening software that asks a bunch of random questions that applicants must answer quickly, the results of which determine a suitability score. Only those deemed suitable are sent through to the department for interview.     The test supposedly shows with a high degree of scientific accuracy whether an applicant is suitable, giving scores for self-confidence, caring nature, respect for authority etc.    So regardless of someone's qualifications and experience, if they don't pass the personality test, their application doesn't even make it past HR.  So my friend sat down with the dept head and took the test. She scored 1 star.    She has worked there for more than 10 years and is quite senior in the department. She has been recognised with internal and external awards for her work. But she wouldn't even get an interview for a junior casual spot in her dept because she failed a personality test.    The HR dept insist their system is highly accurate and they will not pass on any applications from people who don't pass the test. So now the entire department, along with a few senior members of other departments are all taking the test, and coming up with some very poor scores.    So if you're wondering why you never got an interview for that job you *know* you would be perfect for ? it might be because recruiters are basically slaves to shitty software.    There *might* be some systems out there that are actually good at this, but I doubt it. It's basically reading tealeaves or the entrails of a sacrificed goat. People's careers are being derailed by HR astrology. It's clearly not ideal for the orgs that need good people either.

With the NHL draft a week away, it's interesting how many probably still apply to hockey:    Biases of the NFL Draft:  1. People are likely to think their ability to discriminate between two players is greater than it is. ""I think the character is impeccable, so mature for his age. And he fits in to what we have. Barkov, Bjugstad, and Gudbrandon, Ekblad. There's our corner stones of the franchise, they're guys you can build a solid team around for a long time."" Dale Tallon after selecting Aaron Ekblad 1st overall. 50/50?    2. Scouts make forecasts that are far too extreme. Scouts are too likely to say a particular player is going to be a superstar. Note that as you watch the draft, everyone's ""comparable"" was or is an all star. Nobody is talking about a future Zach Sanford at the time of the draft.    3. The winners curse. In an auction, the person who most over values an asset is likely to win. I don't think there are enough trades of high-end picks to test this, but teams who hang on to high picks in bad drafts may be victims. Or teams who hang on to high but not top first rounders in a draft with a distinct top tier, and a murky middle ground. One example is during the same Dale Tallon interview, he talked about taking Ekblad, and turning down the #6 pick (Nylander and Ehlers go 8 and 9), the #24 pick (Bob McKenzie's #22 ranked David Pastrnak goes 25), plus Hunter Shinkaruk.    4. The false consensus effects. When a certain team falls in love with a certain player (or players), they are sure everyone else has too. This is likely part of the reason teams aggressively reach for players. See the Bruins taking Zboril, Debrusk, and Senyshyn, not Barzal, Connor, and Kylington.    5. Present bias. Everyone wants to win now. The theory that future picks are under rated relative to current picks. This would be interesting to test. Also that people are way too quick to think a single player will turn an entire team around. You could argue and for and against the second part of this point.    6. High profile busts actually hurt a team, because teams are likely to ignore sunk costs. Even if a player is not worth, a player who was picked high will get more playing time than their skill suggests they should."""

Coaches do this and it seems pointless, but I'm wondering if it's ever not."" - Dominic F.    The general consensus among analysts is the ""quarter+1"" convention for determining when a player is in foul difficulty and then sitting him until the start of the next quarter is overly conservative. In an effort to preserve top players for high-leverage situations, coaches in effect ""foul out"" their own players early in the game, possibly taking the team out of the running for crunch time, or putting the squad in a closer game, with greater chances to lose, than would have been the case had the star played closer to his normal minutes.  There are other factors to consider of course:    -How foul prone is the player in general? The handsier he gets, the higher the risk of conditioning to play him.  -How well does the player perform in perceived foul difficulty? In the past I have found that certain bigs are very aware of the foul ""rules"" and play with demonstrably less aggression in terms of things like contesting shots or going after rebounds if they are one foul away from sitting for a while. If the player in question has this characteristic, you aren't losing as much by sitting him as you wouldn't actually be getting the same player if you did take the risk.  -Is there something about the game itself that might create and elevated risk of further fouls? Is the player on the end of a particularly tough matchup where he is likely to be put in compromised positions where a foul might occur? Is the refereeing of the contest tighter either in general or around a specific important aspect of the player's game? Basically, are there conditions present that a player's normal foul rate underestimates the risks of playing him?  -How good is his backup/other options? The smaller these drop offs, the smaller the risk in not risking the player."""
