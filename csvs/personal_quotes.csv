The most direct evidence for this claim comes from a study in which people who had bet on professional football games provided tape-recorded accounts of their thoughts about the outcomes of their bets. (Their thoughts were recorded in the guise of keeping a record for themselves to help them make additional bets later in the season.) An analysis of their comments indicated that they spent more time discussing their losses than their wins. Furthermore, the kind of comments made about wins and losses were quite different. The bettors tended to make ""undoing"" comments about their losses-comments to the effect that the outcome would have different if not for some anomalous or ""fluke"" element (""...it was just luck. Their quarterback got hurt during the game and that probably led to their defeat.""). In contrast, they tended to make ""bolstering"" comments about their wins-comments indicating that the outcome either should have been as it was, or should have been even more extreme in the same direction (""I don't think you can put the blame on losing the quarterback. He is an exceptional quarterback, but so is their backup""). By carefully scrutinizing and explaining away their losses, while accepting their successes at face value, gamblers do indeed rewrite their personal histories of success and failure. Losses are often counted, not as losses, but as ""near wins""."""

It's well known that a player born in the last three months of the year has a distinct advantage over his draft classmates, due to the Entry Draft cutoff date of September 15. A first-time draft-eligible player born in October, November or December has essentially had an additional year of development over one born in March, for example, since minor hockey generally uses birth year only to group players into divisions.    But how much of a difference does it really make? Quite a difference, actually.    To illustrate the dramatic effect that a player's birth month can have on his projection, let's look at a hypothetical forward from the OHL, a prospect for the 2011 Entry Draft. He plays for an average OHL team, is of average size (6'1"") and recorded the following statistics: 40 goals, 60 assists and 60 penalty minutes in 60 games. The Projectinator sees this player being worth an average of 8.1 GVT in his prime years, making him a very good prospect; however the projection ranges from 6.0 GVT to 9.9 GVT, depending on when he was born.    The Effect of Birth Month on Projected GVT    Birth Month		Projected GVT  September 1992	6.0  October 1992		6.3  November 1992		6.6  December 1992		7.0  January 1993		7.7  February 1993		8.0  March 1993		8.3  April 1993			8.7  May 1993			8.8  June 1993			8.9  July 1993			9.1  August 1993		9.5  September 1993	9.9    If there's a factor that can cause a swing of as much as 25% in a player's projected value, you'd better be sure to consider that factor. Birth month is a terribly important thing to consider when you're drafting a player. It can make the difference between a great prospect and a merely very good one."""

It's easier to destroy than to create. As a coach, it's easier to tell your players to suffocate the opposing team and not turn the puck over. There are still players whose imagination and creativity capture the Soviet spirit -- Johnny Gaudreau in Calgary, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews in Chicago just to name a few. However, they are becoming exceptions to the rule. Many young players who are intelligent and can see the game four moves ahead are not valued. They're told ""simple, simple, simple.""    That mentality is kind of boring. Nobody wants to get fired. Nobody wants to get sent down to the minors. If you look at the coaches in Juniors and minor league hockey, many of them were not skill players. It's a lot of former enforcers and grinders who take these coaching jobs. Naturally, they tell their players to be just like them. Their players are 17, 18 years old -- younger than I was when I joined the Red Army team. Say what you want about the Whiplash mentality (or the Soviet mentality), but if coaches are going to push kids at that age, why are they pushing them to play a simple game? Why aren't coaches pushing them to create a masterpiece?    We lose a lot of Pavel Datsyuks to the closed-minded nature of the AHL and NHL."""

I won't be ""training"" him at all, really. Here are the rules I'd laid out:    1) It must be his idea. No dragging him to the park to hit unwanted batting practice or throw or field grounders. If he wants to do it, I will make myself available as best as possible.    2) It has to be fun. If it's not fun, we're not doing it. No reason to hate the game at age 9 because your father makes the game terrible.    3) Everything will be done at full intensity and speed, with errors/mistakes not counting. Praise will be heaped on him for swinging out of his shoes and throwing a ball as far as possible 60 degrees away from the target. There is a limited time in youth athletes to develop speed, power, and intent. Sacrificing those for present-day success is the fastest track to stalling out later in life. It also teaches poor life lessons; namely that passion is something that should be routinely derailed for what's important right now - a clear lack of understanding how delayed gratification plays a role in learning, making, and doing.    3a) I will rarely throw balls overhand at him at anything less than 80% of my arm strength (admittedly nothing special, but to a 3 year old, pretty fast). I don't throw balls and nail him in the face with a 65 MPH heater of course, but I throw them against a fence/tarp/net comfortably away from his body, which he picks up and then hits/throws back. I never want him to associate overhand throwing with ""easing it in there."" Underhand throws for field work is fine, overhand is not.    4) He has to bat left and throw right. (Kidding, but he already grips the bat left-handed. Why ruin a good thing?)"""

After all, you could dive into the inside view and draw conclusions, then turn to the outside view. Wouldn't that work as well? Unfortunately, no, it probably wouldn't. The reason is a basic psychological concept called anchoring. When we make estimates, we tend to start with some number and adjust. The number we start with is called the anchor. It's important because we typically underadjust, which means a bad anchor can easily produce a bad estimate. And it's astonishingly easy to settle on a bad anchor. In classic experiments, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky showed you could influence people's judgment merely by exposing them to a number-any number, even one that is obviously meaningless, like one randomly selected by the spin of a wheel.10 So a forecaster who starts by diving into the inside view risks being swayed by a number that may have little or no meaning. But if she starts with the outside view, her analysis will begin with an anchor that is meaningful. And a better anchor is a distinct advantage.  """

Researchers have found that merely asking people to assume their initial judgment is wrong, to seriously consider why that might be, and then make another judgment, produces a second estimate which, when combined with the first, improves accuracy almost as much as getting a second estimate from another person.13 The same effect was produced simply by letting several weeks pass before asking people to make a second estimate. This approach, built on the ""wisdom of the crowd"" concept, has been called ""the crowd within."" The billionaire financier George Soros exemplifies it.

Many people have what she calls a ""fixed mindset""-the belief that we are who we are, and abilities can only be revealed, not created and developed. People with the fixed mindset say things like ""I'm bad at math"" and see that as an immutable feature of who they are, like being left-handed or female or tall. This has serious consequences. The person who believes he is bad at math, and always will be, won't try hard to improve, because that would be pointless, and if he is compelled to study math-as we all are in school-he will take any setback as further proof that his limits have been revealed and he should stop wasting his time as soon as possible. Whatever potential he had for improvement will never be realized. Thus, the belief ""I am bad at math"" becomes self-fulfilling.3  """

Investing in the notoriously volatile world of technology, Khosla has watched countless forecasts fail and he knows he can't specify the next big thing with exactitude. So he spreads his investments around, expecting most to fail, but hoping that he will, occasionally, find one or two of the rare start-ups that beat the odds and yield a Google-size fortune. Most people lack the stomach for this because they look at it the wrong way, he told me in 2013: ""It's funny that a 90% chance of failing people don't like, but a 10% chance of changing the world people love."" This is black swan investing, and it's similar to how Taleb himself traded-very successfully-before becoming an author. But it's not the only way to invest. A very different way is to beat competitors by forecasting more accurately-for example, correctly deciding that there is a 68% chance of something happening when others foresee only a 60% chance. This is the approach of the best poker players. It pays off more often, but the returns are more modest, and fortunes are amassed slowly. It is neither superior nor inferior to black swan investing.

The problem that gets overlooked is the thought that ""hockey is too complex to be modeled"" or ""these teams never won the title"". People love to think that our thoughts and ideas are uber-complex - but they really aren't.    Google ""systems biology"" or ""bioinformatics"". In scientific research we use statistics every day to model thousands of molecules and other moving parts in cancer and other diseases whose functions/roles are much more seemingly random than a hockey game, so tell me again how modeling 10 players in hockey has too many moving parts? Just because most people don't have the desire (and in some cases, the intellectual power) to learn the tools necessary to figure out how to do this doesn't mean that we should just assume that the more ""human"" approach is the correct one. Human nature is to dismiss approaches that we don't understand.    Scientists have developed drug targets and drugs based off these models - some are very effective, but other may only work in 45% of the people treated. So it seems that with these drugs, since they aren't ""championship material"" (i.e. 100% effective), we should dismiss them completely right?:sarcasm:    I get that real life is different (and obviously much less important) than sports, but the models (if done correctly) play out similarly in terms of applicability in many ways. Because sports are entertainment, nobody is forcing you to pay attention to stats if it takes away your enjoyment of hockey's beauty. If people choose to evaluate the games they watch in a more advanced way, why should those who don't feel the need to bash them and denounce their methods (and yes it should go in both directions)?    The ""eye test"" used to be the way to find molecules involved in disease. Over the course of 20+ years, very few were discovered (leading to even fewer treatments) and many human biases were introduced, such as the need to confirm one's beliefs (similar to hockey), money invested, and stature (promotions, Nobel Prize, publication count, etc.). Since statistical approaches started becoming more commonplace in biology (about 15 years ago), hundreds of new molecules (and data types) were discovered absent of bias. Granted, there are many false positives that don't tell us anything, but the true positives are the important discoveries. Just because stats may provide some incorrect interpretations doesn't mean that the correct ones it does provide won't tell us what we want to know (and in a much better way than the eye test)."""

It's a level of scrutiny we apply to almost nothing else in life, and certainly not in this sport. Nobody is going to take a scouts draft board and, if he gets one projection wrong, say that scouting has no place in the league. Yet that's what feels like happens when we talk about analytics.

There is nobody in the league, or who covers the league, that doesn't use numbers to some degree, whether that's field goal percentage or true shooting percentage, whether that's rebounds per game or rebounding percentage, or whether that's points per game or RPM or warp projections.    But where some people have settled on the well-traveled metrics like per-game stats, practitioners of analytics (the good ones, at least) are keenly aware of the weaknesses in the numbers they use, and are always on the lookout for ways to improve upon those weaknesses.

But one difference no one really talks about between regular season and playoffs is coaching and, specifically, opponent-specific preparation. During the regular season, there's very limited practice time and almost no opponent-specific prep. This isn't the NFL, where you get a week. So you can win a lot of games in the regular season on a skill advantage and a novel wrinkle on your PP or what have you. In the playoffs, however, it's a lot of team-specific prep. So it stands to reason that better coaches (and staffs) fare better. And that's part of why you saw the Leafs (Babcock) give the Caps some trouble early. Ditto PIT, to an extent. But Caps adjusted in both. Anyway, people talk about the *what* of the difference between regular season and playoffs (in vague terms), but not so much the *why* of it.

2017-11-30,"""Jason Ochart (@JasonOchart)""","""Sports(Baseball)""","""Twitter""",,,"""An interesting thing happened the other day. Our hitters were hitting 88 mph cutters from the pitching machine. A pro hitter was hitting very well, so I told him ""well done! You're hitting those cutters very well, I'm impressed"" He responded with ""oh those are cutters?"" He didn't realize he was hitting cutters. His next round was pure yip salad, he swung and missed half the pitches, was consistently late and had a terrible round. It didn't make any sense to me, and it's been on my mind. My thoughts are that his brain was able to couple an action(swing) with the perception (incoming pitch) naturally just because he is an elite athlete and mover. This happened subconsciously, as is ideal. But once he was made aware of the pitch, he began to deliberately think about swinging to where a cutter moves. He began to try to override his motor system's method of attaching a movement solution to a movement problem by consciously making the adjustment perceived to be needed. Some of the best hitters I've ever coached have no idea what pitch they hit after at bats. Or when I'd tell them that I picked the pitcher's pitches and will give them verbals, they say they don't want them. It used to confuse me a lot. So I guess the take away is that we have to be careful about where we direct the attention of a hitter. If a guy is flowing and hitting well, the best thing to do is leave them alone. Saying nothing is often the best thing to say. As a matter of fact, telling a hitter what he's doing well (especially physically) when they are doing well is likely a good way to screw them up if they aren't capable or trained to deal with that information productively."""

Not going to lie, I'm pretty sad at the state of the league today. To borrow again from Gartner, 3.5 years ago, we hit the ""Peak of Inflated Expectations"". We are now massively in the ""Trough of Disillusionment"", and I don't see us digging out for a while. I'm hopelessly biased because he's a long time friend of mine, but man, Sunny Mehta is a top tier NHL GM, and instead of seeing him work his magic, we watch a bunch of guys whose dads were famous stumble around like Hans Moleman's kids. We still have 27 GMs who are there because they played pro or their dads are famous. The other three: Lou (no longer an outsider) and the mysterious John Chayka and Jeff Gorton. In today's NHL, any team that spends to cap should be a 93-point team. Literally, VGK, assembled from useless scraps, is that good. So you can make BizNasty2.0 your GM and he'll probably make the playoffs if you give him that much cash. In fact, no GM has really shown any deterministic talent for building a good team. Every GM has either relied on good drafting after being bad, or great legacies. What I find unfortunate, is that nobody has had the guts to break through this. There is so much untapped value in the NHL, you can find a GM who will win the cup at the salary floor. You can't do that by picking up guys who have the aura of being a 2nd line center and who coach knew in Moose Jaw. It's a recipe for being no better than anybody else.     I thought this was worth addressing. Steve Yzerman got his job because he's Steve Yzerman, Hall of Fame hockey player. He may be better at it than the other ex-players who've been hired to do it elsewhere, but ""deserve"" isn't quite the right way to describe it."""

PUCKS is a video system published by a company called Sydex. The genius of the system is twofold. First, you can look at stuff based on events from game sheets. I find what happens after faceoffs fascinating. I was interested in this back before I went to work for the Oilers. I identified teams that were good in certain situations and then I'd work through video from Gamecentre, trying to identify tactics. It was a nightmare to do. With PUCKS, you can say ""OK, SJ gets great results after DZW - what is Todd McLellan up to?"" Then you can sit down and watch his team win 600 defensive zone faceoffs and pick out as much stuff as humanly possible and mark the best clips to show to a coach.     So the first great thing about PUCKS is that it's tied into RTSS. If you can identify situations that lead to certain results with data, you can sit down and just watch that scenario over and over and over with video. Stuff jumps off the screen when you do that, in my experience. The second great thing is that you can mark whatever you want on the video. So a video coach can sit down and watch the game and mark every goalie touch or whatever. @jprutherford had a great story about this recently. It makes collecting clips of something much easier. So if you're interested in something that isn't captured by RTSS, you can capture it yourself by marking the instances when it occurs on PUCKS. I will tell you: the first time I saw PUCKS, my mind was blown. And I've missed it every day I haven't had it, never more than when I look at video for something.

Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.  4. Expand your sense of the possible.  5. Don't trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.  6. Expect no more of anyone than you yourself can deliver.  7. Tolerate ambiguity.  8. Laugh at yourself frequently.  9. Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.  10. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.  11. Give up blood sports.  12. Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Do not endanger it frivolously. And never endanger the life of another.  13. Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)  14. Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.  15. Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.  16. Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.  17. Praise at least as often as you disparage.  18. Never let your errors pass without admission.  19. Become less suspicious of joy.  20. Understand humility.  21. Forgive.  22. Foster dignity.  23. Live memorably.  24. Love yourself.  25.

We now have examples that if done correctly, the opposite is true.    EXAMPLE:   Last season, 32% of the Bucks' true shots (FGA or trips to the line) were from 2s away from the hoop. That percentage has dropped to 15% this season. In exchange, the Bucks are seeing significant increases in shot rates at the hoop and above-the-break. And with the changes, the Bucks' efficiency above the break and at the hoop have improved.    Part of the improvement is due to new personnel (e.g. Brook Lopez) that are better-suited for Budenholzer's desired shot selection. But also, spacing the floor with 3-point threats is proven to open up more space and create efficient looks around the hoop. And when a team is that efficient and attacking that often at the hoop, opposing defenses will collapse/help, leaving shooters open for catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts.    Overall, the Bucks have improved from 1.14 pts per shot last season to 1.19 this season (or 5 points per 100 shots). That's a significant improvement."""

2019-02-20,"""Keith Smith (@KeithSmithNBA)""","""Sports(Basketball)""","""Twitter""",,,"""Quick story time: In April of 2017, as the Brooklyn Nets were winding down what was a pretty terrible season, they signed Cliff Alexander and Prince Ibeh to 10 Day Contracts and waived each player one day later. Odd transaction right? Read on for why and why it matters now.    Turns out that the Nets had promised both Alexander and Ibeh, who had played for the NBAGL Nets that year, that they would take care of them for their hard work. Well, other roster needs arose late in the year, but Sean Marks and crew fulfilled their promise. By signing both Alexander and Ibeh, the Nets allowed both players to accrue an NBA year of service and collect a full 10 Day Contract worth of pay for one day's ""work"". BKN didn't have to do this. Things change in the NBA all the time, especially with 10 Day guys and deal.     So, why does this matter now, two years later, beyond being a nice story? I was talking to an agent who has some mid-tier FAs today and he said ""You know where I'm looking? Brooklyn. They have some money, they develop guys, but they take care of their guys too. Marks and (Trajan) Langdon and the Nets took care of those two NBAGL guys a couple of years back when they didn't have to. We don't forget stuff like that. It makes a huge difference to keep your word in this league. I haven't forgotten it.""    By keeping their word, helping a couple of players and their agents, BKN fostered a lot of goodwill. The agent I spoke with today isn't with the same agency that represents Alexander or Ibeh, but he noticed and so did his players. This stuff really matters. Marks gets it."""

Being a hitter has also helped me be a better pitcher. I was never taught how to pitch because I didn't throw much till college, and even in college I just threw hard, fastballs in, didn't even really know where the ball was going. Now that I'm learning how to pitch, I'm attacking guys certain ways, and when I'm in the box, I see what they're trying to do. I see their plan."""
