2018-04-26,Geronimo,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,8.0,7B+,,soft,3,,True,,,,Day 2 flash. Spent so much damn time messing up the beta my first time here. Was pretty easy the second time around with the correct method.
2018-04-26,The Icehouse,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,,hard,3,,,,,,"More like the sweathouse! This boulder was roasting! Jacob has cousins named Joan, Jean, Jane, and....DAWSON."
2018-04-26,The Pony Ride,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,"Fun fact: my dad LOVES pony rides. I did this because I had no hope of doing the cotton pony dyno move, but it was actually pretty good!"
2018-04-25,Yosemite Highball,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,Mackenzie didn't understand why I topped out backwards....UNTIL SHE DID IT TOO. Then we proceeded to get our asses kicked on fricken everything else at this sector.
2018-04-24,X1,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,1.0,5B,True,hard,3,,,,,,Scary last move in the Nikes!
2018-04-24,Twisted Tree,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,SHOW EM UR DICK TEDDY!
2018-04-24,The Sword,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,3.0,6A,True,,3,,True,,,,Does this count as my first outdoor lead? There were bolts on top!
2018-04-24,Cubicle Gangster,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,0.0,5A,True,,3,,,,,,CHASIN THEM STARS.
2018-04-23,Alfalfa Or Spanky,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,"Lesson of the day: The raisins are ants, the celery is the log, and the peanut butter is the log filling. Still not sure what the ""hidden beta"" was."
2018-04-22,Beckey's Problem,Leavenworth,Tumwater Canyon,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,Third time's the charm. Made the topout real sexy. I finally understand why Teddy didn't top this out...he wouldn't have remembered what to call it on 8a. Kelly's Problem? Nicole's Problem? All girl names are the same.
2018-04-22,Played It Like A Poop Butt,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,0.0,5A,True,hard,3,,,,,,"THIS WAS A V0+, WHAT IS THAT ON THE FONT SCALE?!?!"
2018-04-21,Yoda,Leavenworth,Mountain Home Road,9.0,7C,,soft,2,,,,,,"~10 tries. It was at this point that I realized most of Leavenworth was developed by gigantic lumberjacks, since the dyno was a ""hold the swing"" crux. Gigantic lumberjacks can jump much further than I can, but I can hold on during a swing easier than they can. It'd be cool to be good at both though."
2018-04-21,Cattleguard Arete,Leavenworth,Mountain Home Road,8.0,7B+,,soft,2,,,,,,"~10 tries. I did a semi difficult flat wall!! So what that it's a one move wonder, sharp, and not the coolest problem overall, I'm very proud of myself, and that's what's important. I also did a badass lumberjack style log roll (aka standing on a dead piece of wood, having it roll away, and landing on my buttocks. SUPLEX'D)."
2018-04-18,Arrested Development,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,True,,2,,,,,,"A very nice looking problem, but doesn't climb quite as nice."
2018-04-18,The Real Thing,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,,,3,,,,,,One day I will flash a vertical/slab problem harder than V1.
2018-04-18,Breadline,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,1.0,5B,True,,2,,,,,,FIRST BOULDER IN LEAVENWORTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2018-04-18,The Pocket,Leavenworth,Icicle Canyon,4.0,6B,,,2,,,,,,The last pain free boulder in Leavenworth after hurting my wrist on Pimpsqueak. One day Mackenzie and I will both be healthy at the same time.
2018-02-08,Left Handed Scissors,Roy,Upper Mesteno,5.0,6C,,,2,,,,,,Went off-route on the flash attempt. Fun getting to practice my dynos.
2018-02-08,Ergonomicon,Roy,Upper Mesteno,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,My hands numbed out on the flash attempt. High crux kinda freaked me out.
2018-02-08,Hand Solo,Roy,Upper Mesteno,4.0,6B,,,2,,,,,,So many sucker holds! Cool boulder
2018-02-07,Fun Bags,Roy,Middle Mesteno,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,Climbs really well once your fingers get warm enough to feel the holds!
2018-02-07,Chesticles,Roy,Middle Mesteno,9.0,7C,,,2,,,,,,"Not the best thing I've ever climbed, but gave me some hope that I might be able to top some things out in Roy. Unfortunately, that wasn't super true. Roy is hard (and kinda scary, and sometimes a little chossy :/). Also I did 4 hand moves on the same 2 holds which was kinda unique."
2018-02-05,Flaming Liberty,Roy,Mills Canyon,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,Best problem I did in Roy. Slowly getting better at flatwall (thanks to Mackenzie).
2018-02-02,Nobody Gets Out of Here Alive,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,2.0,5C,True,,3,,,,,,Bookended the trip with sweet V2s. This was my project....AND I SENT!!
2018-02-02,Denizen,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,4.0,6B,,hard,3,,,,,,"Had to wait until everybody else topped out and I was the only one left in the cold, dark cave."
2018-02-02,Bloodline,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,6.0,7A,,hard,3,,True,,,,"Probably the hardest flat wall I've ever done. Had to think ""Keep Going"".http://bit.ly/keep_going_video"
2018-02-01,Better Beat Your Sweeties,Hueco Tanks,East Spur,7.0,7A+,,soft,2,,,,,,"""Once again, that is not the lip"". Wise words from Conor as I informed him that, ""I'm just going to jump"" and proceeded to hold onto a nothing hold. Everybody on the ground was stoked on me."
2018-01-31,Black Mamba,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,9.0,7C,,soft,2,,,,,,"A combo of Castle Rock (yus), and palming a basketball (double yus). Gave myself 20 mins before the sun was gonna destroy the sloper, but only needed 15. Though, in classic fashion, I nearly botched the topout."
2018-01-31,Lobster Claw,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,I was super confident that the name was referring to clawing at this pinch like a lobster. Then I was told it's because it looks like a gigantic lobster claw. It broke my world into a million tiny pieces. I grabbed a sick non-hold on the flash attempt. Conor and Mackenzie were extremely impressed and kept saying how cool I was.
2018-01-29,Hector in a Blender,Hueco Tanks,East Mountain,7.0,7A+,True,soft,2,,,,,,"Not quite as good as Ides, but still pretty good."
2018-01-29,Ides of March,Hueco Tanks,East mountain,6.0,7A,True,,3,,True,,,,Surprised I didn't dab on the rock behind during the lower moves. Climbing with non-numb fingeys is >>>> climbing with numb fingeys.
2018-01-29,Hobbit in a Blender,Hueco Tanks,East Mountain,5.0,6C,,hard,2,,,,,,Brrrr. Kinda scary topout as I was fully numb and didn't know if I was holding onto the hold or not. First day being guided by Kwang. He didn't remember telling me about the pee trail in Squamish back in 2013. Rude.
2018-01-29,Something Different,Hueco Tanks,East Mountain,8.0,7B+,,hard,2,,,,,,"That weird heel move almost destroyed my hamstring, but I'm a god damn warrior so I just endured the pain. Jk. I bitched about it a lot."
2018-01-29,Dragonfly,Hueco Tanks,East Mountain,5.0,6C,True,,2,,,,,,"Slippery feet -> blinded by the light over the lip. Apparently that song (Blinded by the Light) was done by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, which is a sweet name."
2018-01-28,Girls of Texas,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,Went left hand first. For some reason I have really fond memories of this one.
2018-01-28,Sign of the Cross,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,4.0,6B,True,,2,,,,,,"Fuck yes I started slightly lower so I could get that sweet, sweet bonus V-grade. Did this one after putting on a falling clinic (pro tip: go limp) on Choir Boys."
2018-01-28,T-Bone Shuffle,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,"The rock was really cold but this problem warmed my heart. Also, I dabbed on the opening move, but it doesn't matter. Nothing matters."
2018-01-26,Better Eat Your Wheaties,Hueco Tanks,East Spur,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,"Probably should have had a plan for what to do past the 3rd move so I wouldn't go full Thrutch King on the easier moves. Whatever, still sick."
2018-01-26,Frogger,Hueco Tanks,East Spur,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,,,,,"Looks pretty dumb, climbs pretty well. Shoutout to my down jacket for providing endless entertainment with its sweet worm arms."
2018-01-26,The Vulgarian,Hueco Tanks,East Spur,2.0,5C,True,,3,,,,,,HQ warmup. I like jugs.
2018-01-26,El Burro,Hueco Tanks,East Mountain,3.0,6A,,hard,1,,,,,,All I remember is it being pretty warm and wanting to take a nap in the sun. Also Conor did that sick 4 to the right and it was sick as hell.
2018-01-25,Daily Dick Dose,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,I think this one was pretty fun? Don't fully understand why it's so popular though.
2018-01-25,Babyface,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,7.0,7A+,True,soft,3,,,,,,Shoutout to Kenneth Brian Edmonds. This one was pretty fun; good job Hueco! Way to set fun problems!
2018-01-25,Ghetto Simulator,Hueco Tanks,North Mountain,2.0,5C,True,,3,,True,,,,"First problem in Hueco! Access is a gift. This place is a gift. Stoney guy is a gift. Oh, Conor had a fucking SIACK pad ascent on this too."
2018-01-05,Taurine,Red Rocks,Red Springs,9.0,7C,,soft,2,,,,,,Needed a confidence boost and this definitely delivered. It's about time the homie Tom Moulin put up a softie instead of brutally stiff problems like Ultraviolet. Fun double dyno (one of the few times I've successfully gone all 4 points off).
2018-01-03,Vino Rojo,Red Rocks,Kraft Boulders,6.0,7A,,hard,3,,True,,,,"Really good, and not that scary with 4 pads. I even took a backsplat and was totally fine. The trick to survival is to power your body off when you start falling. The trick to doing the problem is to grab a non-existent sloper."
2018-01-02,Drunken Monkey,Red Rocks,Oak Creek Canyon,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,"Hardest fart ascent to date. You know you're having a good time when the number of farts > number of moves. I used perfect beta too. If you want to know exactly how to do this boulder, hmu for good tips (it involves cutting your feet and getting confused)."
2018-01-02,Blood Trails,Red Rocks,Oak Creek Canyon,5.0,6C,,,3,,True,,,,"Incredible problem. Glad I re-climbed it, since my first ascent was fugly as hell. Jolie cruised this on the 2nd session of the day; I think the first time I've seen that work?"
2018-01-01,Brown Round Crack,Red Rocks,Willow Springs,3.0,6A,,,2,,,,,,"Got some SIACK shots of Teddy and Mackenzie on this rig. I may climb like shit, but at least I can take beautiful photographs."
2018-01-01,Peruvian Flake,Red Rocks,Willow Springs,2.0,5C,,,3,,,,,,Really fun. It sucks that I'm awful at this style of climbing because it's really fun when I'm able to do stuff.
2017-12-29,Go Granny Go,Bishop,Buttermilks,5.0,6C,,,1,,,,,,Not very fun. Not very pretty. On a boulder that gets slammed by people. Why is this one popular?
2017-12-29,Bowling Pin,Bishop,Buttermilks,6.0,7A,True,,3,,,,,,"Someday I'll be able to climb the actual ""classic"" problems in Bishop instead of going around climbing second-tier problems because they're less crowded"
2017-10-21,The Swan,Moe's Valley,South-West End,7.0,7A+,,soft,3,,,,,,"Slightly dabbed on the flash :( Guess I feel okay about it since not dabbing was probably the crux for me. As long as you have a ~68 inch wingspan, this is soft. If not, it probably starts to get waaaay harder."
2017-10-21,Dead Rabbit,Moe's Valley,Monkey Boy Area,10.0,7C+,,soft,2,,,,,,"So nice I climbed it twice. Fell off the awkward-not-hard topout the first time I got through the bottom. Thankfully it's really soft (only one hard move, which may not even be hard if I knew how to do a kneebar?). Still, I almost didn't finish after botching the topout because my crimping abilities had been depleted."
2017-10-21,Pink Lady,Moe's Valley,South-West End,6.0,7A,True,,3,,,,,,"Hopped on this to do the bottom moves to warm up, ended up getting flash pumped and nearly botched the top because I was climbing so sloppily."
2017-10-21,Spectro,Moe's Valley,South-West End,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,"Couldn't hold the swing going RH first, but did it first try after deciding to try to go LH like Mackenzie."
2017-10-20,IsRail,Moe's Valley,South End,6.0,7A,True,,3,,True,,,,Real good compression problem. Super pleasant evening send after driving over from Joe's to avoid the Festival.
2017-10-19,Bendin' Corners,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,3.0,6A,True,,1,,,,,,Not super secure at the top; a couple of the jugs feel a little sketch.
2017-10-19,Rims Still Spinnin',Joe's Valley,Right Fork,3.0,6A,True,,2,,,,,,"An annoyingly tricky topout, but this area (The Flu) is really sweet. Huge shoutout to the dudes who developed/recorded/guidebooked/made the trail up to these boulders."
2017-10-19,Glock 9 Handy,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,,,,,"Only one hard move, but a pretty sweet victory dyno/topout."
2017-10-19,Sitzpisser Left,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,6.0,7A,,hard,2,,,,,,"Way harder than it looks and I almost botched the V3 topout (also Mackenzie went V0-V7 today, which was pretty sweet)."
2017-10-18,Big Boy,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,7.0,7A+,,,1,,,,,,"Not a great problem, but reminded me of a great internet picture:http://bit.ly/a_very_big_boy"
2017-10-18,Resident Evil,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,10.0,7C+,,soft,3,,,,,,Total fluke. Pulled on just to remember how to do the come-in move and ended up taking it to the top. Like 6th try this year (after like 600 last time I was here).
2017-10-18,Super Sloper,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,3.0,6A,True,,3,,,,,,A little bit of Castle Rock in Utah!
2017-10-18,Tang,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,Spicy up top! Climbs way better than it looks (since it looks a little crumbly)
2017-10-18,Gatorade,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,5.0,6C,,,3,,True,,,,"I DID A FLATWALL! Plus I totally called it, telling Mackenzie, ""Watch out! This boy's taking it to the top!""Honestly don't know if I've ever been happier to do a boulder."
2017-10-17,Great White,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,6.0,7A,,,3,,,,,,Thuggy and powerful on a cool lip feature. The weird RH holds limit it from getting the recommended flag.
2017-10-17,Playmate of the Year,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,True,,,,"Didn't use a heel, cuz fuck heels. Also managed to miss both of the large pads (nearly 40 ft^2!) from about 4 feet off the ground because I rocket off holds occasionally."
2017-10-16,Big Joe,Joe's Valley,Left Fork,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,"I almost threw a ""Hard"" on this, but I think the first time I tried it I was just pooped since it went 1st go on the 2nd day (and didn't feel super strenuous)."
2017-10-15,Proppa Dyno,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,"Pretty good, but a little spicy at the top (even without any dynoing)."
2017-10-15,Buoux Problem,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,3.0,6A,True,,1,,,,,,This problem was not as fun. Pockets don't make for the best warmups.
2017-10-15,Bowling Ball,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,"This problem was legitimately really good. I'm not 100% sure why, but it is (or maybe I was just stoked that day?)."
2017-10-08,Mad Max,Mammoth,Hartley Springs,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,"FWIW, this would be one of the best problems at CRSP. \_()_/"
2017-10-07,Meadow Face,Mammoth,Way Lake,8.0,7B+,,hard,1,,,,,,"Did it from a half move in cuz I'm a gosh danged IDIOT. 100% not worth the hike, but 100% worth the hot stone massage."
2017-10-06,The Warm Up,Mammoth,Way Lake,3.0,6A,,,2,,,,,,Hashtag crushing the hashtag boulders.
2017-10-06,Crimp Ladder,Mammoth,Way Lake,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,World class pad slide under this problem. Maybe one days I'll psych up for the boulder transfer to Wave Catcher.
2017-09-15,The Amazing Gift,Tahoe,Woods Lake,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,I topped a boulder and Mackenzie picked up her car; gg weekend #2. Too bad I pulled a full Johnny Hekker on the Buttload of Sausage.
2017-09-09,NC-17,Tahoe,Donner Summit,9.0,7C,,soft,2,,,,,,"I topped a boulder and Mackenzie bought a car; gg weekend. A CBarth Original and prob a bit better than Girls on Film, since it's a bit more sustained."
2017-08-17,The Touch,Squamish,The Apron,9.0,7C,,soft,2,,,,,,"Fun roof-jug climbing other than the lone crux move, but if you were tall or had long arms I don't know if this would feel harder than like V6 (maybe the post-crux big move might feel more cramped though?) Had to dyno to the tooth jug cuz I'm not very long, and also didn't want to risk hurting my knee/ankle on that twisty heel hook."
2017-08-15,Practical Horseman,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,,hard,3,,,,,,"Glad I could slay this nemesis with the help of Teddy's tall(er) man beta. Did the top out so so clean. My feet never cut, I didn't one arm lockoff an intermediate, and I definitely didn't grab any moss or anything. Mackenzie cried again watching me, I guess I'm just that inspirational."
2017-08-12,Autobody,Squamish,Grand Wall,8.0,7B+,,,3,,True,,,,"Fun powerful climbing, and a cool mantle move over the lip (did it with a toe under the roof instead of the heel hook method). Wish there were more lines like this."
2017-08-11,Sit Down to Holm Boy,Squamish,Grand Wall,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,"This is really just training for my future super project Lie Down to Sit Down to Stand Up to Sit Down to Holm Boy. I like this type of sloper traversing, where you say fuck technique and mostly campus the cruxy move."
2017-08-10,Sesame Street,Squamish,Grand Wall,9.0,7C,,hard,2,,,,,,So hard for me. Had to really mess around with the beta for nearly every move to make it fell doable. Shoutout to my new Quebecois friends on Tim's Sloper Problem during the final session.
2017-08-07,Master Plan,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,Pretty similar to Golden Boy but maybe a touch harder and a touch better?
2017-08-05,Is It Pure?,Squamish,North Walls,2.0,5C,,,3,,,,,,"First outdoor boulder in over 12 months after ankle surgery; maybe I should have picked something smaller? Super good, but a little dirty up top."
2017-08-04,Portable,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,hard,3,,True,,,,"(Picking up the superfly rock). Proudest ascent to date. Thanks to Keenan for the support, Mackenzie for the video, and basketballs for being a great training device."
2016-08-02,Change Agent,Squamish,Cat Lake,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,"Weird first move and I felt like every topout hold may break. Unfortunately it started raining right after this, but the other problems at Cat Lake look like they could be pretty sick!"
2016-08-02,King Kong,Squamish,The Apron,9.0,7C,,,3,,,,,,"Felt like an epic, even though I only pulled on maybe a dozen times. After the start hold broke, people are calling this V10? Still think it's in the V9 range, there's really only one hard move before the mantel, and I didn't think it was that bad. Botched the topout on the 3rd go in classic Connor Reed fashion. Eventually had to use the mantel beta that was told to me instead of the beta that felt comfortable. Only thing that takes away from this problem is the brokeness of the start holds."
2016-08-01,Anubis,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,hard,2,,,,,,Really tough for me. Had to put my big boy pants on and pull 100%. The move after the big move was almost a devastator.
2016-07-31,Has Tim Doyle Done This?,Squamish,Grand Wall,1.0,5B,,,3,True,True,,,,"OH FUCK SO SICK. Pretty scary topping out. Can't believe it all came together finally. This problem may only be 20 inches off the ground, but it feels much taller, maybe 22 inches! Shoutout to Mackenzie for the encouragement and beta. Would give it 10 stars if I could."
2016-07-29,Depth Charge,Squamish,Grand Wall,6.0,7A,True,,1,,,,,,Shoutout CRSP for prepping me for this. Reminds me of Duct Tape.
2016-07-29,Dumb Slab,Squamish,Grand Wall,0.0,4C,,,2,,,,,,"""I just fell on a V0-"". I think it's sandbagged. Probably closer to V0+"
2016-07-29,The Mantis,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,Kinda randomly ended up here looking for something at the end of the day. This problem was actually pretty fun despite being 5 feet tall.
2016-07-29,The Cricket,Squamish,Grand Wall,5.0,6C,,,2,,,,,,"Maybe should have flashed, but I tried this SICK rose under move. Mackenzie made a lot of fun of me for that beta; she's a H8R."
2016-07-29,Twister,Squamish,Grand Wall,1.0,5B,True,,1,,,,,,I don't remember which problem this was. I bet it was probably unreal.
2016-07-29,Low-rider,Squamish,Grand Wall,3.0,6A,True,,1,,,,,,"Crushed it in my street shoes. Perfect boulder, 3 feet tall, dirty holds, awkward moves, the complete package."
2016-07-27,Minor Threat,Squamish,Grand Wall,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,"Climbs like a gym problem, which I'm apparently bad at now? Had a lot of trouble remembering beta while climbing this."
2016-07-27,King Swing,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,hard,2,,,,,,"Continued on the Squamish nemesis takedown tour with this thing. The Quebecois dudes may not like the far right foot, but I sure did. The sit looks nutty."
2016-07-26,Undertow,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,hard,2,,,,,,In the heat. Felt pretty hard and awkward. Big shoutout to CRSP for the lifetime of preparation to climb this sick rig. Probably not in my personal top-100 though.
2016-07-25,Mr. Bigglesworth,Squamish,Grand Wall,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,On the late night prowl for new boulders. Did it quick after Phil's beta. First move crux for me. The low looks really thrutchy and dabby :/
2016-07-24,Sunshine and Lollipops,Squamish,Grand Wall,6.0,7A,,hard,2,,,,,,Super difficult for me. Rocking onto heels outside of my shoulder box comes so unnaturally. Glad I no longer have to do the first move anymore.
2016-07-24,Phantom Power,Squamish,Grand Wall,8.0,7B+,,soft,3,,,,,,"Good problem, but difficult to find. Only takeaways are the first move being kind of strange and the fall at the finish possibly being scary."
2016-07-23,Dog Days,Squamish,Powerline Boulders,3.0,6A,True,,2,,,,,,"Racing Ra really let me down. I hyped it so hard to Mackenzie and it just wasn't as fun as I remembered, not to mention to scorching heat."
2016-07-23,Typhoon,Squamish,North Walls,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,First of the trip. Not quite as good as Japanese Cowboy but still a fun one.
2016-07-23,The Tugger,Squamish,North Walls,6.0,7A,True,soft,3,,,,,,Had to rush this one in before the boulder got bombarded by 10 Washington-ites. Climbs like a gym problem (minus the semi-tricky topout move).
2016-07-03,Egghead Arete Indirect,Castle Rock,The Graveyard,8.0,7B+,,,2,,,,,,In the heat! Harder than the direct. Maybe I'll super direct one day
2016-06-25,Dark Helmet,Tuolumne Meadows,Raisin Creek,2.0,5C,True,,1,,,,,,"Not 3 stars Charlie Barrett, this problem is pretty shit. It also gets really really hot."
2016-06-25,Spaceballs,Tuolumne Meadows,Raisin Creek,4.0,6B,,,1,,,,,,"Kind of crumbly at the bottom, kind of scrunchy in the middle, and kind of hot at the top. Maybe this is better when it's not a billion degrees."
2016-06-25,Ian's Prow,Tuolumne Meadows,Drug Dome,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,Hooray! I've established myself as the #1 Punter on tour. Mackenzie cried when I fell off the top; she's so sympathetic and sweet!
2016-06-25,White Stuff,Tuolumne Meadows,Raisin Creek,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,"Fun little problem. Jumping can be fun, even off small, sharp, painful crimps."
2016-06-24,Booze Bottle,Tuolumne Meadows,Ridge Top,6.0,7A,,hard,3,,,,,,"Not quite as cool as it looks, but still very good. Took a long time to figure out the top; thanks unchalked mystery crimp, you da real MVP. Thanks to Mackenzie for leading the way to the boulders, no way I would have made it by myself. P.S. - the downclimb is scarier than the actual problem, still haven't figured out a very good way off this boulder."

Blasphemous!) unless it really makes you tired enough where the top becomes harder. I do think it adds a bit of quality, even if it's probably not the obvious start that the stand is."
2016-06-18,Pimp Juice,Tahoe,Pie Shop,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,,,,,"Finally. Told myself in 2012 that I wasn't going to walk back up that hill until I was sure I could do it and it went 2nd go today. Forgot all the beta at the top and ended up doing it probably in as ugly a fashion as possible. Mackenzie dubbed it ""ATD Round 2"" which seems appropriate."
2016-06-17,Troubled Waters,Tahoe,Lost in Space,5.0,6C,True,soft,3,,,,,,"Fun climb, but there's only one move that's semi-hard (the first one). Ender's Game was weird/hard and I couldn't finish, and then I went and got a flapped on Space Race. GREAT DAY"
2016-06-11,Triple Crown,Tahoe,Rainbow,6.0,7A,,,3,,,,,,"Fun problem with a strange off-the-ground crux. Was called a ""heelhook motherfucker"" on this, so thanks for the compliment? I think? Thanks for the wack beta/overenthusiastic cheering meth dudes, you'll make for a great story down the road."

More my style than Midnight Train so it felt slightly easier. Probably not V9 in my book; I don't know why it got the upgrade in the book, both problems should be V8."
2016-06-10,Maximum Overdrive,Tahoe,Boreal,8.0,7B+,,,3,,True,,,,"Glad I got to watch Mark ""Mittens"" Seelos top this out before me or else I would have made a fool of myself. Fun big move to the gaston over the lip. Did it with a toe-in instead of the more common heel method."
2016-06-10,Chillax,Tahoe,Boreal,5.0,6C,,,2,,,,,,Fun problem with kind of a strange topout. The Chiller Face and Ice House look horrifyingly scary.
2016-06-06,"Don't Worry, Be Slappy",Mickey's Beach,Mickey's Beach,6.0,7A,,,1,,,,,,"Awkward, and not the fun type. Probably not V6 after the shift, and probably not as fun? It was 4 stars in the book, but climbs like a pile of crap. I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say it used to be really cool before the shift."
2016-06-05,Grace Face,Mickey's Beach,Mickey's Beach,4.0,6B,,,2,,,,,,"Slightly less awkward than Don't Worry, Be Slappy. Felt like I was actually climbing on this one. This one is def not V5 anymore. Maybe more like V4? V3?"

Tried to go to the Fun House, but it took >1 hr to get to Treasure Cove since the snow made us get lost off the trail. This problem was actually kinda cool, and it gets the Bounty Extra Soft rating!

2016-05-27,Rogue Wave,Tahoe,Firestones,5.0,6C,,,3,,,,,,"Only the awkward start (especially for those without big wingspans) prevents this from getting the Recommended flag. Was kinda scary until I re-arranged the pads, then it was pretty mild."
2016-05-15,Voodoo Birthday,Tahoe,Voodoo Stones,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,"Probably not the ""Perfect boulder problem!!"" as Dave Hatchett claims, but really good nonetheless. If only the hike/bushwack/stream walk/snowshoe approach wasn't such an epic."

Pretty cool setting sitting on top of snowshed. Hard first move and sharp holds after that."
2016-04-30,Root Canal,Yosemite,Curry Village,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,Took a 30 minute nap. Then did some stupid lock-off beta to a weird bump to the lip that I almost messed up. Mackenzie made this look 10x better than me.
2016-04-30,Battle of the Bulge,Yosemite,Camp 4,6.0,7A,,hard,2,,,,,,Had to stare at my right hand to make sure it didn't pop. The combination of the unpleasant pinch and getting swarmed by mosquitoes made this not my favorite thing.

2016-04-25,Nature Nazi Arete (alt.),Castle Rock,Nature Nazi's,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,First time doing it from the double undercling start. Fun day romping around with Mackenzie and Ryan. Getting better at repeating the Castle Classics.
2016-04-22,Technical Contortionist,Castle Rock,Goat Roat,8.0,7B+,,soft,3,,,,,,This one looks like crap but is actually super fun. One of my new favorites at Castle. New book = softer grades? Gave both this and planet caravan V8. Both are probably more like V6. I could see the low start be in that V8/9 range but didn't do it today.

Definitely doesn't match the description of Anti-Future Plan, and felt more like soft V6 than V8. Kinda highball, and a not great landing for 2.5 pads and only Mackenzie spotting. Glad I didn't fall from anywhere past half."
2016-03-31,Spam,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,7.0,7A+,True,soft,1,,,,,,"Bounty Extra Soft. Flashed climbing up, fell on the downclimb. Still counting it as a flash. Cool holds in the overhang, but sharp holds on the bottom and a funky top out."

2016-03-30,Planet of the Apes,Joe's Valley,New Joe's,6.0,7A,,hard,2,,,,,,Really thuggy compression. The trick was to use the higher heel and then it wasn't so bad. Way harder than Chips.

2016-03-30,Vertical Ice,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,6.0,7A,,soft,3,,,,,,"Sooo cold. Don't usually do vertical V6 in 3 tries, so it might be a little soft. Really glad Mackenzie dragged me out here and told me to try. Best line at the Dairy sector for sure."
2016-03-29,Low Tide,Joe's Valley,Left Fork,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,"The ultimate inverse problem. I couldn't send until I was able to do it super pretty and never cut my feet, and Mackenzie thrutched up the finish with the I-just-want-to-be-done method. Power endurance on a short boulder."
2016-03-29,G2-07,Joe's Valley,Left Fork,7.0,7A+,,,1,,,,,,"Yeah, I think I'll pass on the terrible looking sit start and just take 7 points from the more natural stand. Not my favorite problem from Joe's"
2016-03-28,Wills of Fire,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,"Definitely lives up to the hype. Mackenzie and I did it in the rain, so we lucked out and were the only people at the boulder. Did the long cross beta and Mackenzie did the undercling bump."
2016-03-28,Team Effort,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,True,,,,"~10ish tries. Guide said V9, could see it as V8. Couldn't do the top out until I stuck the swing move from the bottom, then it was easy. Didn't know about the heel, so I just jumped for the ear hold; holding that swing was a riot. Did it right before it started snowing."
2016-03-27,Left of The Hulk,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,6.0,7A,True,,1,,,,,,We thought this was The Hulk until it was super soft and I got suspicious. Started really low on some crimpy underclings and made a hard jab into a slot. Then it was about V2. Still kinda fun-ish
2016-03-27,Frosted Flakes,Joe's Valley,Right Fork,4.0,6B,True,hard,3,,,,,,Good gym style climb with a thuggy bump move.

2016-02-29,Woodyard Arete,Yosemite,Woodyard,6.0,7A,,hard,2,,,,,,"Good problem, but a little airy. Was pretty scared with my ankle, so ended up doing every move as statically as possible. Mackenzie took an unfortunate fall; big bummer :("

2016-02-21,Serengeti,Bishop,Happy Boulders,5.0,6C,True,,2,,,,,,Did it really thrutchily and gross. Mackenzie did it really smoothly and nice. Typical.
2016-02-21,Sucker Punch,Bishop,Happy Boulders,5.0,6C,,hard,1,,,,,,Not very fun. Why the hell did it get three stars?
2016-02-19,The Hunk,Bishop,Buttermilks,2.0,5C,,,3,,True,,,,This problem was named after me.
2016-02-08,Pow Pow,Bishop,Sad Boulders,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,"Wills told me to be honest. I didn't find it very hard so I guess this gets V7. Only the weird topout keeps this from getting the 'Recommended' flag. Feels cool to do a move that ""even Daniel Woods can't do."" Thanks for the confidence boost Ryan!"
2016-02-07,Cindy Swank,Bishop,Pollen Grains,7.0,7A+,,soft,3,,,,,,Should have waited 15 minutes for the top holds to cool down and I may have flashed. Fun problem with a semi-committing last move. Another beta spraydown from Mackenzie. Another try-hard devastation from Ryan.
2016-02-07,Michael Caine,Bishop,Buttermilks-Get Carter,9.0,7C,,soft,3,,,,,,8 tries. Decided to try after Mackenzie finished Get Carter. Love the tension and got to do two rose moves. Another instance of Mackenzie telling me what to do after I was ready to leave it for another time.
2016-02-06,Funky Tut,Bishop,Buttermilks,3.0,6A,True,hard,2,,,,,,Scary as all hell pulling onto the angle change. Not my favorite style but I can see why this is popular.
2016-02-06,King Tut,Bishop,Buttermilks,3.0,6A,,,3,,,,,,Way preferred over Funky Tut. I like topout jugs.
2016-02-05,Solarium,Bishop,Happy Boulders,4.0,6B,,,3,,True,,,,Mackenzie flashed. I didn't. Ryan Bauer was proud of us both.

2016-02-05,The Hulk,Bishop,Happy Boulders,6.0,7A,,,3,,,,,,Two full sessions. Would be nice to forget the first session (RIP ankle) but revenge came a couple weeks later. Fun toe-hook cross move to a nice swing.

Probably not worth it. Really hard first move. Really stupid second move. REB was parallel sending some highball on the other side of the boulder. We met on top. It was cute."
2016-01-29,Bubble Butt,Red Rocks,Kraft Boulders,7.0,7A+,,,3,,,,,,Channeled my inner Justin Tucker and drilled a field goal. Used the jump beta. Got nervy on the topout; are those holds going to break?

2016-01-29,Monkey Bar Direct,Red Rocks,Kraft Boulders,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,Night send. Took 7 or 8 tries. Maybe a little soft given it went quicker than the 6s and 7s I did this weekend. Nearly punted the top. The first three moves are really cool and powerful.
2016-01-17,Sheepherder,Bishop,Buttermilks,2.0,5C,,,2,,,,,,Horrifying. Never again. Slab is the absolute worst. Ugh.

2015-11-14,Egghead Arete Direct,Castle Rock,The Graveyard,8.0,7B+,,soft,2,,,,,,Took me wayy too long. 2nd go of the 3rd session. That little slot is just too precise for me. Too bad I can't do it the Zach-The-Bod super direct method.
2015-10-31,Girls on Film Sit,Tahoe,Summit Lake,10.0,7C+,,soft,2,,,,,,"12 tries. Felt real soft, and I'm not a tall person, nor do I have long arms. Only took 1 session (not including the other time I was at the boulder and did the stand) and I don't climb V10 in a session. Epically punted the final V2 jump move to the victory jug, but thankfully sent next go. Really nice conditions today."
2015-10-30,White Lines,Tahoe,Donner Summit,8.0,7B+,,hard,3,,True,,,,"3rd try on the 3rd session. Pumped to put this one in the bag. Should have done it last time with Teddy, but it went on the quick yesterday. The top holds were in the sun, which served as nice motivation because I was freezing standing at the bottom. Did it with no drop knees and going left off the double gastons (not up to the sloper). Mackenzie's got it next time; she fell going to the jug today."

2015-09-19,Paul's Penis,Tuolumne Meadows,Puppy Dome,0.0,5A,True,soft,3,,True,,,,"I was hoping it wasn't going to be too hard, because I was kind of sore from earlier in the day. It turned out to be pretty soft and I never ended up on top."
2015-08-28,The Cutting Edge,Squamish,The Apron,6.0,7A,,,3,,,,,,ON THE LITERAL LAST GO OF THE ENTIRE TRIP. One of the few things that was dry on the last day. Sent first go after Sage sprayed me down with beta. Climbs better than it looks.
2015-08-27,Golden Bowl,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,True,soft,3,,,,,,If this was more than a two mover it'd be top hundy for sure. What a fun 1-2 dyno to the lip! Got all the beta from watching Mackenzie.
2015-08-27,Big Chicken,Squamish,North Walls,9.0,7C,,hard,2,,,,,,2 sessions. In the dark! Thanks to Mackenzie for running back to the car for the lights (even though it was for naught). Heel popped and had to hold a helicoptering foot swing. Teddy made it look so easy but it was super hard for me.
2015-08-26,Tim's Sloper Problem,Squamish,Grand Wall,5.0,6C,,hard,2,,,,,,HARD HARD HARD. Three sessions and it still didn't feel easy when I finished. I suck at mantles :'(
2015-08-24,Rhino Face,Squamish,North Walls,3.0,6A,True,,2,,,,,,Great problem for the Lakai tour! Good team send; really glad Kevin got to crawl between Sage and my legs. Super sexxxy.
2015-08-24,Chicken Lips and Assholes,Squamish,North Walls,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,"Should have flashed this too. Really fun problem, can't believe I never tried it before."
2015-08-22,ATD,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,,3,,True,,,,"Felt really hard 2 years ago, went 3rd go this year. Had a mini-epic topping this thing out. Big ups to Kevin on this one."
2015-08-22,Golden Boy,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,soft,2,,,,,,"I should have flashed. Decent problem, but the dabbiness of the rocks and the deceptively tricky top out definitely take away from it's overall good-ness."
2015-08-21,Underminer's Daughter Low,Squamish,Paradise Valley,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,Powerful low start.
2015-08-21,Underminer's Daughter,Squamish,Paradise Valley,4.0,6B,True,soft,2,,,,,,"Not as good as Little Dragon, but still worth doing if you're at the boulder."
2015-08-21,Storm Troopers,Squamish,Paradise Valley,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,"Tried it a little bit a couple years ago, and then took a couple hours this session. Finally sent after the key Mackenzie beta: ""just overshoot the hold"". Maybe my favorite climb from this trip? Really fun even though it's just a two mover."
2015-08-19,The Fury,Squamish,Grand Wall,9.0,7C,,hard,1,,,,,,"4 sessions. You just gotta get lucky and stick the first move. Shitty problem, but I guess it's better than the Fuzz variations? I refuse to call this V10."
2015-08-19,Pocket Problem,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,,,3,,True,,,,Should be in the top hundy; very fun problem.
2015-08-19,Crystal Method Low,Squamish,Paradise Valley,6.0,7A,,soft,2,,,,,,"First go from the low, which isn't surprising since it adds a V2 move into a V5...which makes it V6?"
2015-08-19,Corrupted,Squamish,Grand Wall,7.0,7A+,,,1,,,,,,Kinda a shit problem. Did it with a dyno method. The only redeeming part is that you climb into a great V1.
2015-08-18,Dyke Surfer,Squamish,Grand Wall,0.0,5A,,,1,,,,,,Jesus this is hard in flip flops. Not a great addition to the top hundy list.
2015-08-17,Timeless Low,Squamish,Grand Wall,6.0,7A,,,1,,,,,,The other boulder is on! Hilarious.
2015-08-15,Superfly Lunge,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,,,1,,,,,,I like the original better.
2015-08-15,Titanic Lunge,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,,,1,,,,,,Didn't feel much different than the main line.
2015-08-15,Black Mark,Squamish,Grand Wall,4.0,6B,,,2,,,,,,"Not my favorite climb, but first Squamish boulder of 2015!"
2015-07-26,Midnight Train,Tahoe,The Saddle,7.0,7A+,,hard,3,,True,,,,"Jesus Christ this took forever. I've been trying this ~once a season since summer 2010. Feels good to finally tick it off 6 years and probably ~7 sessions later. That blind bump move has been my nemesis for so long, I'm glad we can finally be friends."
2015-07-26,The Guardian,Tahoe,Soda Springs,4.0,6B,,hard,1,,,,,,Jesus Christ I suck at slab.
2015-07-26,Holy Water,Tahoe,Soda Springs,4.0,6B,,hard,2,,,,,,"I suck at lip traverses. Good thing I'm going to Squamish in a couple weeks, there are none of those there."
2015-07-26,Fresh Tips Zig Zag,Tahoe,Soda Springs,8.0,7B+,,,1,,,,,,"Oh my god so sick. Start climbing Fresh Tips Right, and then once you've done all those moves, traverse into Fresh Tips for the final couple of moves. Such a sick FA. Dave Hatchett says it's well worth doing."
2015-07-25,Fresh Tips Right,Tahoe,Soda Springs,8.0,7B+,,soft,2,,,,,,"Same start and finish holds as Fresh Tips; so is this problem just alternate beta on Fresh Tips? Or is Fresh Tips contrived? It's an okay problem either way. Probably harder for really small people who like crimps, much easier for everybody else (maybe V6? Felt like solid V7 to me)."
2015-07-25,Tears of Tammy Fay Baker Stand,Tahoe,Soda Springs,6.0,7A,,,3,,,,,,"The sit kinda looks like shit to be honest. The stand was the more appealing line. Fuck the right hand bump beta, just grab the gaston and go up left hand."
2015-07-14,The Grand Traverse,Tahoe,Cisco Grove,4.0,6B,,,2,,,,,,"Kinda fun, but this whole area is pretty bad altogether with an underratedly difficult driving approach."
2015-06-15,Ultraviolet,Tahoe,Rainbow,4.0,6B,,,3,,,,,,If only a pad stack wasn't necessary to pull off the ground. Cool upper moves and a nice height.
2015-06-15,Resolution,Tahoe,Rainbow,4.0,6B,True,,2,,,,,,Really cool Gibbs-Cave-esque first move with a squeezy foot out left. The rest of the problem is just okay though.
2015-06-15,Rain Check,Tahoe,Rainbow,4.0,6B,True,,2,,,,,,"Kinda fun, but the top of this rock was ridiculously hot."
2015-06-15,Continuum,Tahoe,Rainbow,7.0,7A+,,soft,2,,,,,,"Funky lowball problem, but climbed better than I had expected. An added plus is that it stays in the shade."
2015-06-14,Fresh Tips,Tahoe,Soda Springs,8.0,7B+,,,3,,,,,,"In one very long session in the heat, thankfully it stays pretty well shaded. Took a long time to find the beta, ended up settling on some scrunchy heels."
2015-06-13,The Silver Platter,Tahoe,Castle Peak,3.0,6A,True,,2,,,,,,"Pretty fun, mildly sharp holds."
2015-06-13,House of Pain,Tahoe,Castle Peak,4.0,6B,True,,2,,,,,,Good line; very sharp.
2015-05-31,Campfire Arete,Tahoe,Boreal,6.0,7A,,,3,,True,,,,Another nice line at Boreal. Super fun hopping around on the upper jugs. Too bad the downclimb was sorta sketch.
2015-05-31,Terminal Velocity,Tahoe,Boreal,5.0,6C,True,,3,,True,,,,"Whoooaaaa, so much fun. I wanna come back for Maximum Overdrive."
2015-05-30,Rated X,Tahoe,Summit Lake,4.0,6B,True,,3,,,,,,"Very nice! A little heady on the top, but a super duper line."
2015-05-30,Girls on Film,Tahoe,Summit Lake,7.0,7A+,,,2,,,,,,5 tries. Changed the right hand to the wide thumb catch and it went next go. Cool jumpy problem.
2015-05-30,I Read the Articles,Tahoe,Summit Lake,6.0,7A,,,2,,,,,,Climbs way better than it looks.
2015-05-30,Phallic Tractor,Tahoe,Tahoe Donner Boulder,4.0,6B,,hard,1,,,,,,"This problem, and this whole boulder, kinda suck."
2015-05-30,The Dentist,Tahoe,Summit Lake,5.0,6C,,,1,,,,,,Of course this one sucked. Nobody likes going to the dentist.
2015-05-30,Trail of Tears,Tahoe,Summit Lake,5.0,6C,True,soft,3,,,,,,Both with the jump beta and Mackenzie's intermediate crimp beta.
2014-08-31,Human Energy,Rocklands,Plateau Boulders,6.0,7A,,hard,3,,True,,,,So much power endurance! Kevin+Teddy+Me send train. Vanessa and Caitlin will do this too! Maybe my favorite 7A in Rocklands.
2014-08-30,Caroline,Rocklands,Roadside,10.0,7C+,,,3,,,,,,"2 sessions. Maybe Outkast was right?Hardest I've tried on a problem. 2 full sessions, and a lot of beta from Keenan and Conor. Keenan's sneaky toe hook helped solve the redpoint crux, major assist there. Still nearly punted on the top and threw in a sketch double gaston/hand jam when I felt like giving up."
2014-08-30,Vertige,Rocklands,The Pass - Roadside,4.5,6B+,,,2,,,,,,Yeeee gettin on that gaston beta steeze.
2014-08-29,The roof is on fire,Rocklands,Roadcrew,5.0,6C,True,,1,,,,,,"Not sure why this is such a favorite by everybody. The double toe hooks are cool, and the setting is interesting, but the rest of the climb is kind of a pile."
