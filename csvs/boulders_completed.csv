	Whoa! Did much better than expected. Did every move but the first bump (this has gotta be the crux right? Not the move to the jug?) and was semi-close on that a couple times. No left shoe for the heel hook, kind of crazy but the Solutions just have way too insensitive of a heel for that for me.

Session #2 on 2022-08-04 at 17:00:00. 45 attempts, over 180 minutes. 
	Maybe the longest I sat at a boulder, got the top super dialed (brought the Futuras, which work much better than the barefoot method). Just need to link the move to the lip and the first bump. Really hoping I only have to do that once and will finish it off once that happens.

Session #3 on 2022-08-06 at 13:00:00. 20 attempts, over 150 minutes. 
	Another long session of falling on basically the same two moves. Managed to do the bump a couple times in isolation, but VERY low percentage. Came close to doing the bump once from the bottom (but not really even that close, just sorta wildly slapped the crimp with my feet coming off).

Session #4 on 2022-08-07 at 09:30:00. 25 attempts, over 120 minutes. 
	Pretty depressing to keep walking back up here to fall at the same spot over and over. Kind of fully starting to lose motivation. At least the cave is usually much cooler than the rest of the forest so the temperature is pleasant. 

Session #5 on 2022-08-08 at 08:45:00. 15 attempts, over 60 minutes. 
	Tried to wake up early and get better temperature; results very meh. Forgot I don't operate well this early, plus I'm tired, so this was pretty useless. Still did the top a couple of times because I'm loving that part, just that damn bump (and today the move before the bump). At least the forest is very pleasant and still at this hour!

Session #6 on 2022-08-10 at 19:45:00. 10 attempts, over 60 minutes. 
	WARNING: Long ass comment.

Walked up. Felt pretty bad (sprained my ankle yesterday, so figured this would be a decent option because you fall on your back not your feet). Definitely was not one of those days where I felt ""strong"". Basically expected to fall on the same move again, maybe learn some small technique to possibly increase odds (did find a trick, to look away from the hold to do the bump, made me focus on my bottom hand even more).

Pretty quickly it started to get kind of dark, since I didn't get up here until around 7:45 and I realized I couldn't see my feet too well so I set up my phone flashlight on the ground pointing at the feet and gave it a couple attempts from the bottom. First couple didn't connect on the first big move to the little crimp. Eventually I hit it and just felt locked, eyed up the bump hold, looked away, and pushed. Somehow was still on the wall in a spot I'd practiced dozens of time. Didn't get the heel very good, and the crimp felt way worse going from the ground, but everything stayed and I hit the jug (almost blew it taking the heel out, could have definitely done that a lot cleaner).

Pretty gnarly that a month ago I was flopping up (and down) 5 star pillar and making that V0 Dealer look bad, and now I've done the hardest boulder I've ever done. I'm pretty sure I'm the weakest and least skilled climber to ever do this, but sometimes you just need to walk back to the same thing until you fluke into getting to the top.

This is the first thing I feel like I've truly projected in a long time, and the feeling of success after doing it is pretty great! The feeling while projecting it is kind of anxiety inducing though and I don't think I like it, but clearly from the length of this comment it meant a decent amount to me. So tl;dr, I'm happy I did the boulder and in hindsight the process was fun, but I'm not sure if I'd do it again; time to go back to easier stuff.""",,,"""CRUXY""",,"""CRIMPY""",,,"""POWER""",,"""OVERHANG""",,,,

	A mixture of See Sharp and Free Willy located between Assisted Living and Ghetto Simulator. Only 1 star in the book but I thought it was pretty good, but it fit my style pretty well (basically straightforward climbing on a moonboard esque wall).
Beta for Casey: 
Move #1: Ear hold with RH, LH on crimp. LF pretty low, RF pretty high (mostly for balance, you drive more off the LF), move LH to 1/3 pad crimp. I liked to hit it as far left as possible and I full crimp.
Move #2 *crux*: Bring RF down directly below RH and perch on it. Left foot goes low/left mostly for balance, but I think I may have gotten a little push out of it. There is an intermediate RH at similar height to LH. I go to this and pause, but I think if you were confident you could go all the way up to the next crimp (sharp but good).
From there you just have to keep it together for the most part. It's not over, but the holds are all there and your feet are really good. It's kind of a 1.5-mover in the sense that the most off the second left hand contains most of the difficult, but the rest of the moves aren't trivially easy, just nowhere near as hard.""",,,,,"""CRIMPY""","""SHARP""",,,,"""OVERHANG""",,,,

Even though new people are scary I figured I should try a couple times because it would be unsafe by myself and I'm not sure if I'd climb with Casey+friends again before leaving town. Ended up doing it the second time I did the jump move (the move to the crimp after felt tough to me, even when I did it I did not feel confident) and got real scared on top.
