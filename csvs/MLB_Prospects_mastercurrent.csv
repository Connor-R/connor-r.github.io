What does it take to draw such significant expectations? Let's first examine the statistical case. Franco has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 19 until March). During those games, he's hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the entire minor leagues, and it's possible the power hasn't fully actualized yet because Franco still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% last year). How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate are both above big league average, which, again, is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is in the Florida State League.   Of course, the visual baseball evaluation is also incredible. Franco had one of the best BP sessions at the Futures Game (his was better than Jo Adell, Nolan Jones, and everyone not named Royce Lewis) and the best infield. His hands are a powder keg, accelerating to the point where he can do huge damage, and he doesn't need mechanical length to get there. This is true from both sides of the plate; Franco can't be thwarted by turning him around and forcing him to hit from a weaker side. He might not ever produce big home run totals without a swing change, but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been. A scouting director once told me, ""Elite players are elite all the time,"" and that has been true of Franco since he was a young teen. He's been a force of nature offensively, he plays a premium defensive position very well, and my degree of confidence in his ability to do both in perpetuity is high because that's all Franco has ever done.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""54.5""","""66.4""",,,,,"""|""",,,,2.0,,0.0,"""|""",60,45,55,60,50,60,80,60,60,60,55,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""MIN""",0.500,"""XXX"""

Gore pitches the same way a great horror movie villain lurks and ambushes from the shadows. The strange, balletic way he hoists his leading leg and hands as high as he can before he peddles home builds fear of the unknown, and dread anticipation the same way eerie music portends someone's cinematic demise. Then Gore lunges home with a huge stride, one that takes him slightly down the first base line, and gets right on top of hitters, creating more discomfort. Then, suddenly, the jump scare. The ball explodes out from behind Gore's head and blows past flailing hitters at the letters, banishing them to the dugout until their sequel at-bat a few innings later.   Gore generated a 16% swinging strike rate overall last year and a 15% swinging strike rate on his fastball, which is amazing for a heater that only averaged 93 mph. Several other traits -- Gore generates nearly perfect backspin and seam uniformity on his fastballs, which you can see in the video that corresponds to this player capsule, and the flat approach angle of his stuff contributes, too -- help the fastball play up, including Gore's command which projects, at least, to plus. Spin efficiency also enables his curveball to be good even though it lacks big raw spin, he has glove-side command of his slider, and his changeups, though they're of mixed quality, are typically well-located. You can go wild projecting on Gore's secondary stuff, especially the changeup, and his command because he is such an exceptional athlete, and the fact that he can repeat and maintain such an odd and explosive delivery is clear evidence of that.   The 2018 blister problems created some short-term workload issues that San Diego's dev group tried to solve by shutting Gore down for most of August. He threw side sessions for most of the month before returning for one last in-game outing before the Texas League playoffs, which he didn't pitch in. He had a 40-inning increase from 2018 to 2019, when he threw 100 frames. It puts him on pace to throw 120-140 innings this year, though it only makes sense for San Diego to push him if they're contending for the playoffs. Based on how they handled Paddack and Tatis last year, such an approach seems possible.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""51.8""","""59.1""",,"""|""",0.7500,0.0000,0.0000,2.0,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2150,2000,50,55,50,50,55,,,60,60,60,55,60,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""BAL""",0.500,"""XXX"""

If you want a visual example of ""twitch,"" watch Lux swing. His feet work slowly, and his right knee draws back toward his left hip like the string of a bow (different than his high school swing's footwork, which was more Sammy Sosa-ish, with ground contact in both directions) while he remains balanced and poised to strike. Then he strides forward, his hips clear, and his hands, which are looser and freer than they were as an amateur, ignite. Once Lux's hands get going, everything is over very quickly. He's tough to beat with even premium velocity but also identifies pitch types while they're in flight and can punish secondary stuff that catches too much of the zone. The other swing changes aside, Lux's bat path is relatively similar to what it was when he was a skinnier, gap-to-gap hitter with doubles power, except now he's very strong and balls are leaving the yard. He has pole-to-pole power and is going to get to it in games even though he's still a relatively low-launch angle hitter (nine degrees in the minors, 13 degrees in a small big league sample).   What happens with Lux defensively is somewhat immaterial. He's publicly admitted to having the yips, which impacts the accuracy of his throws. Pure arm strength is not really an issue, but if he keeps one-hopping easy throws to first base, he might need to move off the infield. I have the arm graded as a 45 because of the accuracy issues and think there's some risk Lux needs to move to the outfield, but even if that's the case, I feel better about him hitting than all but one other prospect in all of the minors.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""58.6""","""65.0""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",60,60,65,55,50,45,70,70,65,55,55,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""CIN""",0.500,"""XXX"""

While his gait appeared compromised during Extended spring rehab outings, Adell was asymptomatic throughout the summer and during the Arizona Fall League. After a brief jaunt in the Cal League, the Angels sent him to Double-A Mobile, where he'd had a strikeout-laden cup of coffee the year before. He adjusted, cut the strikeout rate down to a very livable 22%, and hit .308/.390/.553 over two months before he was sent to Triple-A in August. Again, Adell struck out a lot when he was challenged, and there are people in baseball who worry about how often he K's, but he was just 20 years old and has had success amid many swing changes since he signed, a common theme among Angels prospects.   Adell's leg kick has been altered; he now raises it even with his waist at apex, and the height at which his hands load (as well as the angle of his bat when they do) was quite nomadic throughout last year. By the time Adell was done with Fall League and had joined Team USA's Premier12 Olympic qualifying efforts, he had a Gary Sheffield-style bat wrap. Adell is one of the best athletes in the minors (there's video of him box jumping 66 inches online) and the fact that's he's been able to manifest these adjustments on the field at will is incredible. Even if something mechanical isn't working in the future, chances are he'll be able to fix it. I've settled on projecting Adell in left field. The arm strength he showed as an amateur, when he was into the mid-90s as a pitcher, never totally returned after it mysteriously evaporated during his senior year of high school. He has a 40 arm and is such a hulking dude that he's just going to be a corner defender at maturity. Strikeouts may limit Adell's productivity when he's initially brought up, but I think eventually he'll be a middle-of-the-order force who hits 35-plus homers.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""48.2""","""55.5""",,,,,"""|""",,,,2.0,,0.0,"""|""",35,50,70,60,45,40,45,70,70,50,50,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""COL""",0.500,"""XXX"""

I wasn't worried about Pearson being a true injury risk because his maladies (an intercostal strain, a fractured ulna due to a comebacker) have been unrelated to the typically concerning elbow and shoulder stuff. Instead, I wanted to see if he could hold his elite velo under the strain of a full-season workload, and what his secondary stuff would be like when he was forced to pitch through lineups multiple times. Not only did the velo hold water but Pearson's repertoire is very deep. Yes, he'll chuck 101 past you, but he'll also pull the string on a good changeup that runs away from lefty hitters, dump a curveball in for strikes to get ahead of you before gassing you with two strikes, and tilt in one of the harder sliders on the planet, a pitch I've personally seen him throw at 95 mph and that regularly sits in the low-90s. Does he need to throw well above 100 innings to be a true front-end arm? Yes, but that he was able to retain his stuff amid a huge innings increase in 2019 is a sign he'll be able to do so with even more innings folded in. A source with offseason intel tells me Pearson also remade his body and has gotten a little leaner. We won't truly know until he reports to camp, but if that's true, it bolsters my confidence in him sustaining this level of stuff for several years.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""56.8""","""60.0""",,"""|""",2.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2350,2400,45,80,55,50,60,,,50,80,60,55,60,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX"""

He's a front-end arm with heightened injury risk.""","""The summer before his senior year of high school, Luzardo looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, and touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and needed Tommy John.   After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone, it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) wasn't enough for many teams to have high-level decision makers get in to see him and want to take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and when he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal.   After a dominant first full year in Oakland's system, Luzardo appeared poised to seize a rotation spot early in 2019, when suddenly, the very contagious injury bug that has bedeviled Oakland pitching prospects for the last several years infected his shoulder and, later during rehab, his lat. He was confined to early-morning sim games on the Mesa backfields until June, when he was sent to rehab at Hi-A Stockton and then to Triple-A Nashville, where Luzardo's pitch count climbed back to typical starter norms. Oakland 'penned him for September, a multi-inning weapon for the stretch and playoff run. He was sitting 94-96 and touched 99 as a starter in the minors, the same as he was out of the big league bullpen. It's a sinker, but it has barrel-shattering tail and pairs nicely with both of Luzardo's secondaries, which live at the bottom of the zone and beneath it. He'll add and subtract from his breaking ball to give it a curveball shape that bends into the zone for strikes, or add power to it and coax hitters into waiving at pitches that finish well out of the zone. His changeup is firm but has late bottom and should also miss bats. The violence in Luzardo's delivery combined with his injury history is slightly worrisome, but he was clearly operating at full speed late last year and has top-of-the-rotation stuff and ptichability, so his 60 FV has that risk baked in.

His fastballs, both the two and four-seam variants, are parked in the 93-97 range and peak at 99 mph. His low-ish arm slot gives his heater sinker shape, which means it's more likely to induce weak groundballs than it is to miss a lot of bats, though May occasionally uncorks two-seamers that run off the hips of left-handed hitters and back into the zone like vintage Bartolo Colon. Based on how he worked in the big leagues last year, May's out-pitch is going to be his low-90s cutter, which he commands to his glove side (he has great east/west command of everything). This is despite the fact that his vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. He's shown an ability to backdoor it to lefties and it was a finishing pitch for him in some of my minor league viewings, but it was de-emphasized in the big leagues, perhaps because it doesn't pair well with his fastballs. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now, though I'd like to see more backfoot breaking balls against them this year.   This is nit-picky, but May's leg kick can make him slow to home and he can be vulnerable to stolen bases as a result, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners. Regardless, he projects as an All-Star, mid-rotation starter.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""54.5""","""59.1""",,"""|""",1.0000,0.1667,1.5000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2550,3150,50,65,45,,60,55,,60,65,50,,60,60,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX"""

And Manning succeeded while devoting time to two sports, which caused him to get a late start during his draft spring because the hoops team was in the middle of a deep playoff run (Manning threw late into the prior summer, so this may have actually been good for limiting innings).   After some initial strike-throwing issues and a change in stride direction, the REM cycle arrived. The walks came down, Manning's changeup got better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation. He's never had arm issues (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury), and he has rare on-mound athleticism coupled with an understanding of how to pitch. He's going to have three out-pitches thanks to adjustments he's already made, and it's fair to assume he'll be able to make more.

It's terrifying that Robert can generate the kind of power he does with such a conservative stride back toward the pitcher, and it juxtaposes with many of the movement-heavy swings that have been pervasive throughout baseball since Josh Donaldson and Jos Bautista broke out.   Robert does have plate discipline issues. He chases a lot of breaking balls out of the zone and it took a lot of convincing from industry folks to move him as high on my Top 100 as I did even though Robert has the surface-level traits that tend to make me irrationally excited. He has one of the best physiques in pro sports, he's a plus-plus runner, and his instincts in center field are terrific. The power production and OBP may be somewhat limited by the approach, very similarly to how Starling Marte's have been, but Marte is a 60, so here we are.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""50.9""","""58.2""",,,,,"""|""",,,,2.0,,0.0,"""|""",35,50,65,70,60,60,45,60,65,70,70,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""ATL""",0.500,"""XXX"""

He was unusually homer-prone during his big league stretch, something that has never been an issue before even with middling velocity, because McKay's command is so good. I think it's a small sample blip that will regress over more innings, though I did have folks from analytically-inclined teams suggest that I slide McKay down on my overall rankings when I circulated the list for feedback.   His fastball only sits 90-94 and touches 96, which is pretty average, but McKay keeps it away from the middle of the zone where it can really be hammered and often ties hitters up with it because he locates so well; his swinging strike rate on the heater was close to 17% in the minors, so I think it'll play. His cutter command is arguably even better, and he peppers the glove side of the plate with it at will. Changeup usage was scarce in his big league sample but I think it will be one of the focal points of his repertoire, perhaps usurping the curveball, which has a stronger visual evaluation than it does if you look at the spin data. It's a repertoire/command profile similar to a lot of good lefties (Hyun-Jin Ryu, Mike Minor, Cole Hamels), though most of them are more reliant on the cambio than McKay has been to this point. He may not have the rate stats of the other arms in the 60 FV tier, but I expect he'll make up for all of that with volume because of how efficiently he works.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""53.2""","""59.1""",,"""|""",0.5000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2250,2050,55,55,50,55,,50,,70,55,55,55,,55,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""MIN""",0.500,"""XXX"""

Mize has hellacious stuff. His four-pitch mix has actually gotten better since college because he and the Tigers successfully added greater demarcation between his cutter and slider, the latter of which now has more two-plane sweep. His entire repertoire is capable of missing bats, like Manning's, but Mize's split is superior to Manning's change and he has an additional weapon, the cutter, that Manning does not.   So why ever-so-slightly prefer Manning? Mize's injury track record is as scary as his stuff. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder when he was a draft-eligible high schooler, he had elbow issues as a sophomore at Auburn, he had a PRP injection after he pitched for Team USA the summer before his draft year, and in 2019, he missed a month with a shoulder injury. After Mize returned, he had some outings where his fastball was in the 90-92 range, he used his splitter less frequently, and when he did use it, it had more spin than usual. It's speculation, but perhaps he was tinkering with changeup grips after the injury. That's an awful lot of smoke. Purely on quality of stuff, Mize is arguably the top pitching prospect in all of baseball. We still love him and think it's perfectly reasonable to consider him the top youngster in this system and one of the best on the planet, but what Manning has become, what he might continue to develop into based on his athleticism and now-evident ability to make adjustments, combined with his much, much cleaner bill of health, shades him ahead of Mize, in our (mostly Eric's) opinion, within the same FV tier.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""58.6""","""60.9""",,"""|""",0.7500,0.0000,0.0000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2250,2500,55,55,,,60,70,55,60,55,,,60,70,60,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""PHI""",0.500,"""XXX"""

His entire profile is ideal. It's rare for ambidextrous swingers to have polished swings from both sides of the plate, even moreso to have two nearly identical, rhythmic swings that produce power.   It's more atypical still for that type of hitter to be a great defender at a premium position. Rutschman has a pickpocket's sleight of hand and absolutely cons umpires into calling strikes on the edge of the zone. Resolute umpires end up hearing it from biased fans who are easier marks. Aside from two instances, all of my Rustchman pop times over three years of looks are between 1.86 and 1.95 seconds, comfortably plus timed throws often right on the bag. Rutschman has the physical tools to become the best catcher in baseball, provided he stays healthy (he had some shoulder/back stuff in college). He's also an ultra-competitive, attentive, and vocal team leader who shepherds pitchers with measured, but intense encouragement. It fires up his teammates and feels like it comes from a real place, not something he's forcing.

The hand speed and rotational ability to hit for power is there, and he's athletic enough to make adjustments in order to get to that power (selectivity might also be an issue), which, coupled with some of the flashiest, most acrobatic defense in pro baseball, gives Pache a cathedral ceiling.   Even though he's already started to slow down a little bit, Pache's reads in center, his contortionistic ability to slide and dive at odd angles to make tough catches, and his arm strength combine to make him a premium defensive center fielder -- he's a likely Gold Glover barring unexpected, precipitous physical regression.

The strike-throwing hiccup isn't great, but Whitley clearly knows where his stuff plays best (fastballs up, the cutter and slider to his glove side, and the curveball beneath the zone -- a well-designed mix nearly ubiquitous in this system) and he works in those locations pretty loosely. Inefficiency might limit Whitley's inning totals, but it's unlikely to prevent him from starting. Ideally, Whitley shows up to camp in better shape than he appeared to be in during the Fall League; he underwent a much more drastic athletic metamorphosis in high school (which coincided with his pre-draft velo spike), so it seems very possible.

Kelenic is absolutely jacked but it hasn't detracted from his twitch, nor has his size borrowed from his range in center field, which is suitable if unspectacular for the position.   The carrying tool here is the bat, which has been the case since Kelenic was 15. Like most elite prospects he's been one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- best hitters his age from the time scouts began to see him, and Kelenic hit elite prep pitching all throughout high school. He is short to the ball with power, and can just turn his hands over and catch heaters up, in, or both, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. The .540 SLG% from 2019 is a bit above what's realistic going forward, largely because there's just no more room for mass on the body. As is the case with most hitters evaluated in this stratosphere, reports of Kelenic's competitiveness and work ethic are strong, and have been since he was in high school. In fact, one scout on the amateur side thought he was too intense at times, sort of in the Jimmy Butler realm of teammate interaction, but I haven't heard anything like that lately.

That ended his season but in that narrow window of health we saw glimpses of Bart's power with physically fit phalanges. And we had plenty of looks at his power, particularly to his pull side, in college, including a titanic blast that cleared the facade of Georgia Tech's football complex in left field and was never found.   The defensive tools are the foundation of Bart's skillset, the cornerstone of a certain big league future. He's Mike Alstott's size but with the lateral quickness and ground game of a small-framed catcher. He's quick out of his crouch and throws accurate lasers to second base. He also has field general qualities: he's a rousing, vocal leader at times, a calming presence at others. We still have some questions about the hit tool -- we posited Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around in college and developed some bad habits, but he was swing-happy again in 2019.

Among these is footage of Miguel Cabrera's big league debut, which I put on one fall night as I prepared to cut up Fall League video of Julio Rodriguez taken earlier in the day. As I split my attention between a fresh-faced Miggy and a young Julio, I noticed a rare similarity: front foot variation. Some hitters are capable of altering their stride direction based on pitch location, perhaps best exemplified by a famous GIF of Cabrera hitting home runs on pitches in six very different parts of the strike zone. In that GIF you can faintly make out how Cabrera's footwork varies on several of those swings, and though he doesn't do it consistently yet, Julio shows glimpses of this same seemingly innate aptitude, especially his ability to open up, clear his hips, and wreck pitches on the inner half.   He can be fooled by sweeping breaking balls that make him want to open up and pull the ball, and hell swing at inside sliders that finish away from him, but other than those consistent issues, Rodriguez is a very mature hitter, with a mature personality and body to match. He excelled despite Seattle's very aggressive full-season assignment, a move I was skeptical of, and had an impressive Fall League as an 18-year-old. He's already a 40 runner (I had him timed in the 4.4s throughout Fall League), which means he is ticketed for right field rather than center, but the bat is real. I have plus hit and power projection here and I know scouts who have a 70 on the bat, though his approach and the way his head was flying out during some of his AFL at-bats stopped me from going that heavy with my hit tool grade.

To a degree, those remain reasonable, though they're no longer applicable across nearly as much as Lewis' skillset as they once were. Initially, those comps came from Lewis' penchant for on-field leadership, some elements of his swing and frame, and, less positively, his future as a defensive shortstop. The Twins took him first overall and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a tightly-packed top tier of talent.   Throughout his first 18 months as a pro, Lewis had statistical success while being promoted aggressively before a developmental hiccup in 2019. His overall production has slowly come down at each subsequent level, and during a 2019 season split 3-to-1 at Hi- and Double-A, he had a .290 OBP. Don't let the robust .353/.411/.565 Arizona Fall League line (he went to pick up reps after an oblique strain during the year) and MVP award fool you -- Lewis still clearly had issues. His swing is cacophonous -- the big leg kick, the messy, excessive movement in his hands -- and it negatively impacts Lewis' timing. He needs to start several elements of the swing early just to catch fastballs, and he's often late anyway. This also causes him to lunge at breaking balls, which Lewis doesn't seem to recognize very well, and after the advanced hit tool was a huge driver of his amateur profile, Lewis now looks like a guess hitter. His mannerisms -- Nomar-level batting glove tinkering, deep, heavy, deliberate breaths between pitches, constant uniform adjustment -- are manic, and they seem to pull focus away from the task at hand rather than grounding him in a ritualistic way, and the game often seems too fast for him.   So why are we still so high on him? We're betting big on Lewis' makeup and physical talent. His BP's were the best in the entire Fall League. He is an exceptional teammate, leader, and worker, who did more early infield work than anyone else Eric saw in the AFL, willing himself to become a viable left side infield defender even though he lacks the traditional grace and fluidity for those positions. We don't think the swing works as currently constituted -- it's a mechanical departure from when Lewis was successful in high school -- but we think it'll get dialed in eventually because of his athleticism and work habits. Even if some of the pitch recognition stuff proves to be a long-term issue, we still think Lewis will be a versatile defender who plays several premium positions (we have him listed in center field because if we had to pick one spot where we think he'll eventually be best, that's it) and hits for considerable power. There may be an adjustment period similar to the one Javier Bez experienced early in his career because of the approach issues, but the star-level talent will eventually shine through.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""41.8""","""53.6""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",30,40,60,60,40,50,50,60,65,50,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX"""

His exit velo data is not great, but it was instructive to watch Brujan in the Fall League next to several other players with similar statistical and defensive profiles who aren't nearly as athletic or as physically projectable as he is. There were lots of other narrowly built infielders of similar age who simply don't have Brujan's musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey) or explosiveness. I think there's room for mass even though Brujan is short, and that he'll continue to harness his hellacious cut, which, based on his contact rates, he already has abnormal control over.

But one could argue there's a selection bias for height in the pitching population, perhaps one that'll melt away as we keep learning about approach angle, and, because part of the formula for torque (which could theoretically be used as a measure of stress on the elbow) is the distance from the fulcrum, that longer-armed, usually taller pitchers might actually be more of an injury risk than a little guy like Deivi. It's unusual to project heavily on the command of a Triple-A pitcher but it isn't strange to do so on that of a 20-year-old, so even if there are some growing pains related to Garcia's fastball command it's good to remember he's the age of most college pitchers in this year's draft.   Garcia has big stuff. He works 91-95, mostly at the top of the zone when he's locating, and backs up that pitch with a knee-buckling, old school 12-to-6 curveball that has big depth and bite. He sells his changeup by mimicking his fastball's arm speed but doesn't create great movement on that pitch right now. A better third offering during the early part of his career will probably be his mid-80s slider, though that will be more dependent on command to play. It's possible for a starter to be a 55 when they only throw 120 or fewer innings (Brandon Woodruff and Blake Snell did it last year) but it's much easier if you inch closer to 140. We may find out about Garcia's ability to do that in 2020 if the Yankees increase his innings as they have the last two years, or the big club may need to stick him in a lower-volume role immediately.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""50.9""","""55.5""",,"""|""",0.7500,0.0000,0.1667,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2200,2750,40,55,45,70,50,,,50,55,50,70,55,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""SF""",0.500,"""XXX"""

That carried over to his first four starts of 2019 but was interrupted by shoulder soreness that benched him for two months. After he returned, the Phillies moved him pretty quickly to Double-A for six starts, then had him finish in the Fall League. His stuff was great in Arizona. He touched 99, sat mostly 93-97, his curveball and changeup were both plus, and his slider's two-plane tilt gives Howard a second viable breaker, capable of garnering whiffs when it's located away from righties.

That's the soft part of the profile, but the indicators both to the eye (scouts rave about the swing, bat speed, and feel at the plate) and in the stats point to elite ability to manipulate the bat. One club told us his percentage of balls hit with 95 mph-plus exit velo and a launch angle between 10 and 30 degrees (i.e. hard hit line drives and fly balls) was in the top 3% of the entire minor leagues.

Then he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John, which kept him out for all of 2018 and most of 2019. Throughout the spring of 2019, you could just show up to Fitch Park in Mesa and run into one of Luzardo, Puk, James Kaprielian, or any of several other high-profile A's rehabbers. Puk got into game action in April and May, throwing as many as four innings in an outing (that I'm aware of, anyway) before he was finally sent to an affiliate in June, but only in a two-inning start or bullpen capacity. He never threw more than 47 pitches in an outing and was limited to 20 or 30 bullets when the A's finally called him up in September. He threw fewer curveballs in that role than he theoretically will as a starter, making that pitch tough to evaluate when he returned, but all the other weapons are intact, and Puk should contribute to Oakland's rotation in 2020.

He had no trouble with the leap from amateur to pro velocity, though some of the top high school pitching he saw the summer before his draft year was probably better than what he faced in the 2019 AZL. He has a knack for impacting the baseball in a way that creates hard contact even though his swing is currently pretty flat, and he can do this all over the strike zone. Of the trio of elite AZL prospects (Abrams, Bobby Witt, and Marco Luciano), Abrams has the most polished hit tool and the most room left on his frame. Even without a swing change, he's going to grow into more power just through maturity, which is pretty scary considering his exit velos are already above big league average (though, again, AZL pitching wasn't good last year).   I don't think he's a shortstop. When he has time to step and throw, Abrams has enough arm for the left side of the infield, but ask him to contort his body and make tough throws on balls he has to go get and the results are mixed. Most players with this issue end up in center field, where Abrams could be a plus defender because of his speed, assuming his instincts there aren't terrible.

Marsh still hit the ball on the ground a lot during the regular season and only averaged about five degrees of launch angle, but by his Fall League stint things clearly looked different. Like Jo Adell showed late in the fall, Marsh's hands loaded a little farther out away from his body and he had what some scouts called a ""wrap"" or ""power tip,"" where the bat head angled toward the mound a bit, setting up more of a loop than a direct path to the ball.

That includes Jazz, who was acquired in exchange for Zac Gallen before the trade deadline. The swap meant Miami gave up six years of what looks like a mid-rotation starter for six-ish years of Chisholm, who might be a superstar or strikeout too much to be anything at all.   Chisholm has whiffed in 30% of his career plate appearances, partially a product of a sophomoric approach to hitting and otherwise due to him arguably being too explosive for his own good. But that twitch, the violence, Jazz's awesome ability to uncoil his body from the ground up and rotate with incredible speed, the natural lift in his swing -- many of the things that make him whiff-prone also make him exciting, and give him a chance to be an impact offensive player who also plays a premium defensive position. His skillset is somewhere on the Chris Taylor/Javier Bez continuum of strikeout/power offensive profiles at a premium defensive position. We want to see another year of plus walk rates (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%) before we declare that to be a true part of the skillset, but the power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and we think he has a chance to be an above-average defensive shortstop, though for the first time we had one dissenting source on the glove.

Even as a 17-year-old on Arizona's backfields, he stood apart physically from rehabbing big leaguers several years his senior, and instantly attracted evaluators' attention, like the gravitational pull of a very dense star. And star is apt because that's the kind of projection Robinson's tools allow for. Big, fast, and prone to generating thunderous contact, he's more physically alike to young SEC pass catchers than most of the baseball-playing universe. But the background -- a giant, Bahamian man-child without the showcase track record of most of his Dominican peers -- meant the industry knew even less about how Robinson would handle pro pitching than it did the average J2 prospect. After some initial inconsistencies, Robinson has not only quelled those concerns but also surpassed expectations, and in 2019 he clubbed his way from the Northwest League to full-season ball as an 18-year-old.  Robinson's bat path lacks the lift necessary to produce in-game power on par with his raw, but the foundation of his swing is sound, with nothing too complicated despite Robinson's size. He's already hitting 50% of his balls in play with an exit velo of 95 mph or more, which is up in Joey Gallo/Nelson Cruz territory, it's just often low-lying contact. Robinson's fast enough to continue being developed in center field, but there's a good chance he ends up on a big league roster with a superior defender who kicks him to right. His ceiling, that of a 35 homer force who can play a passable center, hasn't changed since he first began appearing on the electronic pages of FanGraphs; his progress is just evidence that such a future is becoming more likely.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""40.0""","""55.9""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",20,45,60,60,45,60,50,60,70,55,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""KC""",0.500,"""XXX"""

But even we didn't expect he'd nearly go 20/20 and slug .518 at Double-A Springfield. Judging by the fervor this performance created among our more fantasy-focused readers, they may be wondering why we were ahead of the curve a year ago, but aren't hitting the gas on Carlson's evaluation now after the year he had. We certainly like him -- Carlson is balanced and coordinated while hitting from both sides of the plate, his left-handed swing has gorgeous lift and finish, he has advanced bat control for a switch-hitter this age, he's athletic and moves well for his size, and he has high-end makeup. But we have some questions about the ultimate ceiling.   Carlson is an average runner and a large dude for a 20-year-old. His instincts in center field are okay, but not good enough to overcome long speed that typically falls short at the position. Because of where we have his arm strength graded, we think he fits in left field or at first base. The TrackMan data we sourced also indicates that his 2019 line is a bit of a caricature. His average exit velo (about 88 mph) and rate of balls in play at 95 mph or higher (about 34%) are both right around the big league average, rather than exceptional. The in-office types we talk to about this kind of thing are in love with Carlson because he's only 20, and they anticipate these things will improve, but visual evaluation of his build don't suggest as much physical projection as is typical of someone this young, because he's already a big guy. As a result, he was on the 50/55 FV line for us during the process of compiling this list. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (it's 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center field when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable, so he tipped into the 55 FV range. But we think he's closer to the line than one might conclude if they were just looking at his surface stats.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""44.5""","""53.6""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",40,40,50,50,50,40,55,55,55,40,55,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""LAA""",0.500,"""XXX"""

""","""If you google ""Brendan Rodgers,"" the first several results are for Leicester City's soccer coach, who has been managing Premier League teams since 2008. Baseball's Brendan Rodgers has been known to scouts for about that long, and has been hitting the entire time. Even as an underclassman, Rodgers was often the best player on the field at well-attended showcase events; when he was a high school junior, scouts thought that if you were to drop him in the draft a year early, he'd still go somewhere in the first round. By his pre-draft summer, Rodgers clearly had the best hit and power combination among his peers, and looked likely to stay on the middle infield. He was the early favorite to go first overall in 2015 until Dansby Swanson, Alex Bregman, and Andrew Benintendi took a leap the following spring, allowing the Rockies to get him third overall.   One axiom to which we try to adhere is ""good hitters hit all the time"" and that is indeed what Rodgers has done for the last eight years. He's a career .293/.348/.491 hitter in the minors, and while most of Colorado's affiliates play in hitter-friendly parks -- this fact has masked some of Rodgers' mediocre pitch recognition -- we anticipate he'll continue to be a plus hitter in the big leagues. His initial major league trial -- a rough 25-game jaunt in the early summer -- was not especially encouraging. Rodgers hit .224, swung and missed twice as often as he had in Triple-A (8% swinging strike rate in the minors, 15% in the majors), and generally appeared overwhelmed. But an 80 plate appearance sample doesn't usurp Rodgers' lengthy track record of hitting. In November, Rodgers told the <em>Denver Post</em> that he had been dealing with ""nagging"" shoulder issues since 2018 before deciding to have labrum surgery in June of 2019. As of mid-November, he had yet to begin throwing and hitting. Because he's only a fringe runner and athlete, Rodgers' conditioning during rehab is pretty important. A heavy, lumbering Rodgers who needs to play third base is swimming upstream against a 105 wRC+ at the position, while a Rodgers capable of playing second has a 94 wRC+ bar to clear.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""51.4""","""55.9""",,,,,"""|""",,,,,,0.0,"""|""",55,50,55,45,45,55,60,60,55,45,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX"""

He'd be higher on the list if not for his injury history.""","""Miami had Sixto throw in Extended Spring Training (he threw bullpens until mid-April, then got into games) to control his season-long workload coming off an injury-plagued 2018 (he had visible discomfort in his neck and shoulder early in the year, elbow soreness later on, and skipped Fall League due to collarbone soreness) before sending him to Double-A for the bulk of the summer. There is a gap between how many bats his fastball misses (he has 8% swinging strike rate on the heater, where the big league average on all pitches is 11%) and what you might expect at this velocity (Sixto averages 97, touches 101) because it has sinking/tailing movement rather than ride. Whether Miami player dev can adjust that without compromising Sanchez's control and health remains to be seen.   His changeup, which is one of the better ones in the minors, will be his primary out pitch unless or until that happens. The cambio has bat-missing, screwball action, so much that it dips beneath the barrel of right-handed hitters as well as away from lefties. Sanchez can also run it back over the corner of the glove side of the plate, freezing perplexed hitters. Though his slider has plus spin, it's horizontal wipe means it needs to be located off the plate to work, but Sixto, especially considering how little he's pitched in his life and how far backwards his build has gone on him to this point, commands it pretty well. The same arm slot/hand position change that might add more ride to the fastball could add more depth to the breaking ball, but you could argue that such a change is an unnecessary risk considering Sixto's injury history and how well everything already works.   Knowledge of the fastball efficacy gap combined with the injury history has us down on Sixto a little bit.

It's more within the realm of possibility for those who think a lot of issues with lateral agility can be masked through some combination of arm strength (Cruz has a freaking hose) and good defensive positioning. What if this guy, who I'll once again body-comp to Harold Carmichael and Brandon Ingram before I search for a less instructive baseball avatar, actually stays there and grows into 80-grade raw power? How bad would the contact issues need to be for him not to be a great player if that's the case?   Indeed there are folks in baseball who are skeptical of Cruz's hit tool because of his lever length, and those concerns are exacerbated by how often he likes to swing. There are several vastly different ideas as to how his body and game will develop as he fills out, and scouts who think Cruz is destined to slow down and move to right field or first base, and who also have concerns about the contact, don't even think he belongs on this list. But consider this: At this age Aaron Judge, who is as close as we're going to get to a physical peer for Cruz, was striking out 21% of the time at Fresno State. Split between Hi- and Double-A, against competition way better than Mountain West Conference pitching, Cruz whiffed 25% of the time. That's not bad for someone this age and this size. I will concede that the approach is bad and that the swing needs polish if Cruz is going to get to his power in games. I'll also concede that the Fall League look was bad (he missed several weeks with a foot fracture), and his LIDOM performance was, too. This is one of the -- if not <em>the</em> -- highest-variance players in the minors, but there aren't many who have a chance to be what this guy might. Even the outcomes more toward the middle of what is likely -- a center fielder with a hit tool in the 35-40 range with huge power, a right fielder or third baseman with the same, a gigantic target at first -- are still fine.

Last January, when most baseball facilities across the country were dark, just feet away from oblivious Peloton riders and tennis-playing retirees, a lucky few scouts and media folks had a religious experience watching the sweetest-swinging teenager on Earth absolutely roast balls fed to his barrel by a high-speed pitching machine. Because of how close you can sit next to the field there, you can feel the sonic force of bat-to-ball impact radiate into your body. When Marco Luciano connects, you feel it to your core. He is not normal. To find bat speed comps you need to look toward Javier Baez, Eric Davis, whatever the top of your mental catalog might be. And while he already generates plenty of it, Luciano's square-shouldered frame indicates more power might be coming. The length created by Luciano's natural, uppercut swing is offset by the explosiveness in his hands; he's not particularly strikeout-prone and he doesn't take out-of-control hacks. Unless something unforeseen about Luciano's approach is exposed as he moves through the minors, all of this power seems likely to actualize. His AZL walk rate is encouraging early evidence that he's unlikely to be so exposed.  As an athlete and infielder, Luciano is only fair. He might play a passable shortstop one day because his hands and actions are fine most of the time, but he can't presently make strong, accurate throws from multiple platforms. It looks increasingly likely that he'll move to the outfield, enough so that some scouts have him projected there, but it's too early to cut bait and move him. He has elite hitting talent, he's produced on paper, and he already has average exit velos and a hard-hit rate that grade as 65 on the scale. If he continues to perform, especially if the Giants send him right to Augusta and he hits his way to San Jose, then this time next year we'll be talking about Marco Luciano as one of the best prospects in baseball, and if he does so while improving his infield defense, perhaps <em>the</em> best.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""36.4""","""59.5""",,,,,"""|""",,,,,,0.0,"""|""",25,25,60,50,40,50,60,70,70,45,45,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

The exciting physical characteristics -- a lanky, projectable frame, the sort you typically see on the mound, the hands, actions, feet, and arm strength for short, precocious feel to hit -- shared by Mauricio's franchise-altering shortstop predecessors, the stuff that had us deliriously excited about him before he even signed, are still present.   The explosiveness and physicality of cornerstone, power-hitting shortstops still percolates beneath the surface, which is fine because Mauricio will be 18 until April and it isn't reasonable to expect that he'd already have grown into impact power. When most players his age are either in the midst of their freshman season of college or getting ready to start Extended Spring Training, he might be in the Florida State League. Because he'll be so young and in a pitcher-friendly league, it's very likely that a year from now, we'll be ignoring a pretty lousy statline for contextual reasons. With another full year of data to consider, we now know Mauricio is a little swing-happy and that, even if that explosion arrives, he either needs to develop feel for lift or tweak the swing if all the power is to actualize. Hopefully we're not living in the timeline where Mauricio outgrows shortstop and those two things remain issues. Switch-hitting shortstops with power, uh, don't really exist. That Mauricio has a chance to be one means he may one day be the top overall prospect in baseball, and several outcomes short of that ideal are still very, very good.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""33.6""","""50.9""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",25,20,45,50,45,55,50,50,55,50,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""WAS""",0.500,"""XXX"""

He has a very athletic swing despite being decidedly unathletic in every other way, enabling all fields power and high rates of contact.

The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, its a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average.

Rodriguez checks all but two significant boxes. One is the ""totally healthy"" box, as he was shut down with an elbow issue in July. The other is the thoroughly modern ""vertical slot/backspin"" box typical of starters whose fastballs I'm more confident in. But this is not a vanilla, three-quarters slot. Rodriguez is well below that, and his upright, short-armed, slingy arm action presents almost a side arm look. It's unique, and creates an awful lot of tail on his fastball. Sitting 92-95, up to 98, and weaponized by Rodriguez's advanced east/west command, it's a potential plus pitch. A split-action changeup is currently his best secondary, while his slow curveball lacks sharp-looking movement but has plus raw spin.   I think a fully-formed Rodriguez has a different breaking ball than this one, so in this instance I'm making an abstract projection based on Yerry's talent for spinning the baseball. He needs something he can work inside on lefties, either a cutter or a more traditional breaking ball with better back foot angle. From a performance standpoint, Rodriguez has 167 K and 29 BB over the 136.2 innings he's thrown the last two years.

Because Liberatore's fastball has sinker movement, the growth of his changeup is going to be the most important aspect of his development, since those two pitches have similar movement, and will theoretically tunnel better. The results produced by his knockout curveball, which has all-world depth, may suffer because he doesn't have an up-in-the-zone four-seamer to pair with it, but should Liberatore decide to get ahead of hitters by dumping that curveball into the zone, good luck to them. It's the type of pitch that's hard to hit even if you know it's coming, but might be easy to lay off of, in the dirt, because its Loch Ness Monster hump is easy to identify out of the hand. All of the advanced pitchability stuff -- Libby started learning a slider during his senior year of high school, he varies his timing home, and he's likely to pitch backwards with the breaking balls -- is here, too, and that'll be important given the lack of a bat-missing fastball.

He struck out a lot (again) during the 2018 stretch run, when St. Louis pushed him to Low-A Peoria because he wasn't being challenged in Johnson City. Sent back to Peoria for the first half of 2019, Gorman adjusted to full-season pitching and roasted the Midwest League to the tune of a .241/.344/.448 line, cutting his strikeout rate by eight percentage points. He was promoted to the Florida State League for the second half, and while his walk rate halved and his strikeout rate crept above 30% again, Gorman still managed to post an above-average line for that league as a 19-year-old. The strikeout issues will only become a real concern once Gorman stops showing an ability to adjust over a long period of time.   His huge power, derived from his imposing physicality and explosive hand speed, is likely to play in games because of the lift in Gorman's swing and his feel for impacting the ball in the air. Because we're talking about a teenager of considerable size, there's a chance Gorman has to move off of third base at some point, but for now we're cautiously optimistic about him staying there for the early part of his big league tenure.

Graterol thickened considerably during this stretch and is now listed at 265 pounds after he signed at 170. This, combined with some release point variance and injury hiccups (three IL stints in the last year and a half, including some shoulder stuff), have led to relief risk in the eyes of some clubs. Indeed the Twins put Brusdar in the bullpen late in the year and had publicly declared their intent to put him there again this season before they traded him to the Dodgers (after initially sending him to the Red Sox) as part of the Mookie Betts musical chairs deal.   He de-emphasized the changeup during his 2019 relief stretch, but of course he may be subject to more tweaks with his new org.

He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to North Carolina to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school. Multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days, and he looked very, very good, much more comfortable than expected given his level of experience. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually they came to think that Adams' only athletic peer in recent draft history was Byron Buxton. Teams assessed his signability and the Angels were comfortable using their first rounder on him.   He didn't play much during that first pro summer, but the Angels surprisingly skipped him over the Pioneer League and sent him right to full-season ball, even though he'd only been solely focused on baseball for a year. Adams had a slightly above-average statline there, which is incredible for someone who only just picked up a bat. He is built like you probably expect a D-I wide receiver recruit to be built, he's an 80 runner, and while the swing foundation isn't great, the Angels are one of the most proactive, swing-changing orgs.

He'll also work an upper-80s slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left- and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors.

Due to a deep veteran staff at Texas A&M and his own inconsistency, Martin only really pitched for part of one season as a starter while he was in college. A lot of teams thought he was just going to be a reliever. The Astros popped him in the second round of the 2017 draft, hoping to tease out the traits they saw on the Cape, and in the two years he was in the org, they did it. Martin was a top 100 prospect before his elbow blew out late last June.  Healthy Martin sits in the mid-90s, mixes in a hard, upper-80s slider, has an above-average power changeup, a more vertically-oriented curveball, and average command. He made too many mistakes during his short big league look in Houston last year and gave up a bunch of dingers, but we think he'll get his pitch execution issues ironed out and attack hitters the way most Houston arms do: fastballs at the top of the zone, sliders off the plate to the glove side, and changeups and curveballs down. Martin was part of Arizona's return for Zack Greinke. We've diluted his FV a bit because we worry the timing of his surgery will mean he misses most of 2020, though Martin is a premium athlete and animalistic competitor, and people in his current and former org expect him to crush his rehab and be back as soon as possible.

More significantly, like Segura, Peguero is remarkably short back to the baseball; his barrel enters the hitting zone in the blink of an eye, giving him an extra beat to decide whether or not to swing. It also makes it hard for pitchers to beat him with velocity, since he's rarely late on anything and has quick enough hands to get on top of pitches near the top of the strike zone. He's also remarkably strong in the hands and wrists for a teenager and is already producing average exit velos above the big league average, though Peguero cuts down at the ball and is currently groundball prone. His swing may get longer as his attack angle changes.   Perhaps the place where the Segura and Peguero Venn Diagram does not overlap is on the defensive end of things. Peguero is a plus athlete with above-average hands and arm strength, which could make him an above-average defender at short in time.

He was about a year removed from falling to the 2018 draft's second round in part because his stature didn't allow for traditional, frame-based power projection, but he's very strong for his size (Thomas' dad is the White Sox strength and conditioning coach) and already has average raw at age 19. He's well-conditioned, but short, built narrowly, and likely to max out with a frame (and skill set) similar to Brett Gardner's.   He lets balls travel deep into the hitting zone and sprays hard contact all over the field -- about half of his extra-base hits were stuck to the opposite field last year, many of them doubles sliced into the left field corner. An unchanged approach to contact would likely result in limited over-the-fence power, but Thomas is fleet of foot and either projects in center field or, due to arm strength, as a plus-plus left fielder, which takes some pressure off the offense. There's some tweener/fourth outfielder risk here but Thomas now has a four-year track record of hitting against pitching that is often older than he is, beginning with his performance on the showcase circuit as an underclassman and ending with an aggressive promotion to Hi-A toward the end of 2019. It's pretty amazing that an undersized, young-for-the-class hitter from a cold-weather location has moved this quickly without a hiccup, and we're inclined to believe Thomas will keep hitting and eventually become an everyday big leaguer.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""40.0""","""55.5""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",25,40,50,60,50,40,60,50,50,60,55,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

During his pre-draft summer, Greene was a little soft-bodied, his running gait was odd, and he seemed destined to play little more than an average outfield corner. The player scouts watched the following spring had a better physical composition, was more explosive and a better runner, and had as ripe a high school hit tool as was available in the draft. This was similar to how Jarred Kelenic's skills were colored as he came out of high school.   Greene's swing, curated by his father from an early age, is beautiful. He can clear his hips and turn on just about anything on the inner half, drop the bat head and lift balls with power, strike balls the other way with authority, and he tracked and whacked many high school benders. The bend and flexion in Greene's front knee as his swing clears the point of impact is reminiscent of several Dodger hitters. Though there are many examples of Greene having certain types of athleticism (he is a tremendous leaper, for instance), he's not a runner and we don't have him in center field.

While we expect that future changes to the way balls and strikes are called (i.e. an electronic strike zones) will make it so below-average receivers like Varsho can catch quite comfortably, it's also going to raise the offensive bar at the position in a way that alters how we think about catchers generally. Once framing became quantifiable, the average wRC+ at catcher went from about 93 down into the mid-80s. If that skill becomes moot, catcher offense will certainly rise.   Varsho's case is unique, as is his skillset for the position. He's a plus runner who might steal 30 bases at peak, a contact-oriented, gap-to-gap hitter with catalytic qualities found in old school one and two-hole hitters. How much of that spark erodes if Varsho is asked to take a beating behind the dish one hundred times a summer? Probably some, and when paired with his defensive shortcomings -- he has a fringe arm, trouble catching balls cleanly, especially toward the bottom of the zone, and at times struggles to block breaking stuff in the dirt -- there are suddenly several reasons to limit his catching reps and deploy him in left field, or perhaps try to hide him at second base. Varsho seems motivated to catch and he's both quite athletic and highly competitive, two things that often help prospects carve paths to unlikely big league outcomes. So while we think it's becoming less likely that he will be an everyday catcher, we're still in on his offensive ability, makeup, and rare collection of skills, and remain intrigued by the proposition (and growing likelihood) that he'll be a dynamic, multi-positional player who catches once in a while.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""45.5""","""50.9""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",45,40,50,60,40,45,55,45,50,60,45,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""PIT""",0.500,"""XXX"""

So confident is Perdomo in his notion of the strike zone that, after taking a looking strike three during Fall League, he flipped off the TrackMan unit calling balls at Salt River Fields.   That skill combined with Perdomo's bat-to-ball ability from the left side (his right-handed swing is bad) and his elegant shortstop defense, gave him a promising foundation of skills as a teenager on the backfields. Then, the juice started to come. Perdomo's exit velos climbed throughout 2019. He averaged about 80 mph off the bat at Low-A, then about 82 mph after his promotion to Hi-A, and finally averaged 87 mph during a limited Fall League sample. His body has become more mature, and his left-handed swing has become more explosive and now features an overhead, helicopter finish similar to Miguel Andjar's. There's still some room for improvement as it relates to the lower half usage in the swing, and it's possible Perdomo scraps hitting right-handed altogether at some point. The skills/instincts foundation here is solid enough to project Perdomo as a low-end regular, and the burgeoning physical ability means he's begun to look like quite a bit more than that.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""39.5""","""52.3""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",35,30,45,55,45,55,55,45,50,55,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

If you think the pitch can carry two thirds of the load, Skubal is too low on this list.""","""Skubal was rehabbing from Tommy John during his junior year at Seattle University and only managed to throw a few bullpen sessions in front of scouts before the 2017 draft. Scouts liked what they saw, but not enough to meet a price tag that was up around $1 million according to sources. Skubal went back to school and was horrendous early in the year before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes. Now 29 teams and their evaluators are cursing themselves for either failing to notice that upward trend throughout the 2018 spring, or for noticing but lacking conviction in the draft room.   There are some folks in baseball who have Skubal right up in the same tier with Mize and Manning. He has a dominant fastball, equal parts velocity, ride, and tough-to-square angle. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his pro career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play last year) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much; anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. An occasionally good changeup and slider aside, Skubal's secondaries are not all that great in a vacuum, but luckily they too benefit from the funky angle created by Skubal's cross-bodied, high-slot delivery. His overall swinging strike rate (18%) was higher than the rate on his fastball alone (15%), which means the secondaries were a net positive for him, but we're unsure of what big league hitters will do if they know a fastball aimed at the letters is coming most of the time. So while he's had nothing but goofy strikeout rates for two years, we think Skubal ends up more toward the middle of a rotation rather than the front.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""48.2""","""51.4""",,"""|""",0.5000,0.0000,0.0000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2350,2200,40,65,45,45,50,,,45,65,50,45,55,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

That was the question put to me about Kowar by a source for this list. On some level, they're right. Like Paddack, Kowar has a prototypical frame, he throws in the mid-90s, and has a dominant changeup. What we now know about how and why fastballs play, however, creates some separation between the two. Though Kowar has premium starter fastball velocity, the pitch has tailing/sinking action rather than Paddack-style carry and ride, which means it's going to generate groundballs more than it will miss bats.   Kowar's breaking ball was comfortably below average in college but the Royals have found a way to add raw spin since acquiring him (his rates are up from 2150 rpm to 2400, still shy of big league average but an encouraging development), and it's closer to average now. He'll likely rely on the element of surprise and his ability to locate it in order to be effective. This is all very similar to how Luke Weaver's reports read coming out of Florida State, and I expect Kowar to have a similar career. He's a 23-year-old who's thrown half a season above A-ball, so while I think he'll be a 50 FV eventually, there needs to be a little gap between him and someone like him who's ready for the big leagues right now.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""50.0""","""52.8""",,"""|""",1.0000,,0.0000,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,2400,40,55,65,45,,,,45,55,70,45,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX"""

At one point, Johnson was so raw that some scouts wanted to see him on the mound, but he's performed consistently all the way through Triple-A, slashing .284/.344/.460 as a pro. That's close to the league-average line for outfielders, so why not include Johnson on the top 100? His relative lack of defensive instincts make him more of a fit in right field than in center and I think big league arms will be able to pitch to him in a way that limits his power output below the corner outfield average.

After an uneven but promising freshman year in the bullpen, Singer's command improved and he carved up SEC lineups for the next two years.   His stuff and delivery don't have the look of a dominant, whiff-getting major league starter, at least not at the moment. He has a lower, three-quarters delivery that helps create long tail on his two-seamer, but the pitch only resides in the 91-94 mph area, a 45 raw velocity that I think plays a bit better because of the movement. His low-80s slurve/slider (when it's down below hitters' knees it has more length) gets buffed by Singer's command and also plays up above its raw quality. Singer is a spiky competitor who goes right at hitters and at times has demonstrative body language when he's frustrated with umpires, which are generally traits the industry likes. On talent, he's a No. 4/5 type of starter for me, and any change to that will be determined by how Singer's changeup, which he barely used in college, develops in pro ball.

Now if he starts hitting for more power in games, that's a horse of a different color. He has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, his first broken hamate likely masked his thump and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. He had the second hamate break in pro ball and his swing is also very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases.

He isn't great there, but most of Lowe's other abilities have been slow to develop, so it's possible the feel for the position will come eventually. For instance, Lowe has power but has been strikeout prone since his prep days. But once he started playing pro games and generating data, it became clear that, despite the whiffs, he had a great idea of the strike zone. The raw power didn't really show up in games until Lowe's batted ball profile began to shift in 2018. His groundball rates were in the mid-40% range until that year but slowly began shifting downward, then Lowe had a breakout statistical 2019 as a 21-year-old at Double-A.

He's been shut down an awful lot. Last year, after just three starts, a shoulder issue sent him to the 60-day IL. It was Morejon's fourth IL stint in the last two years, and he was later scratched from a Fall League start for back tightness. He pitched in relief upon return, which changes the context for the velo. A few other nits. Morejon babies his breaking ball into the zone, and his arm speed changes in a way I think is noticeable. From a spin axis/efficiency standpoint, his fastball is the sinking type that tends not to miss bats, which is part of why I think he's been hittable in a small big league sample, including a nuclear spring outing in Peoria that he followed (and rectified) with a bat-breaking clinic in Tempe against the Angels' varsity squad. Some of this seems imminently correctable, especially considering Morejon's age, but the way the injury history interacts with his relief risk and the fastball traits put him in the 45+ FV bucket with a bunch of other guys with mid-rotation ceilings who I'm scared to really bet on.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""50.0""","""55.6""",,"""|""",1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2450,2600,40,55,,55,,,55,50,55,,60,,,60,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""ARI""",0.500,"""XXX"""

His slider and curveball (the latter is better) ran together a bit, and his changeup had inconsistent finish. But often, elite command of what is a 55-grade pitch in a vacuum leads to elite results (see: Bieber, Shane), and I think that sort of secondary pitch effectiveness is possible for Kirby.   One of Seattle's stated post-draft goals for the right-hander was to make him stronger. In 2020 spring bullpens, Kirby looked noticeably thicker and stronger, and he is indeed throwing harder, touching 99 mph several times in Peoria side sessions. Logan Gilbert threw very hard in a similar setting the year before, and though his in-season velo band was beneath his pre-season bullpens, he was still above the prior year's range. The difference is the obvious change in Kirby's body. I expect something similar to Gilbert's trajectory here (and for Juan Then, who appears later on this list and was also throwing much harder in the spring before baseball shut down).

An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Lefties get a good look at his fastball because of Crouse's low slot, and the velo he would theoretically gain out of the bullpen (he was up to 102 out of the bullpen in a 2017 All-Star Game) would give him the margin for error he needs to not be crushed by them.

""","""Casas was one of the more heavily scouted underclassman high school prospects in recent memory, and stood out while hitting in the heart of the lineup for South Florida-powerhouse American Heritage, various Team USA squads, and at travel showcases and tournaments. Some of that success was probably because he was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left his games having seen him swing just once or twice because he walked constantly. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was.   He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing, though mostly during instructs, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer. But expectations are that he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package.

Medina's stuff is fantastic and has been for a while. He was up to 96 mph as a 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2nd due in part to his horrendous command.

He was a woebegone, full-time shortstop until 2018 when he began playing third base, then last year he spent an overwhelming majority of his time at first base, while playing a bit at third and closing the year with a month in left field. The eerie shadow of the LF/DH projection (he's had issues throwing to first base) has loomed around Mountcastle's profile for a while now, but he keeps hitting enough for me to like him anyway.   Mountcastle's timing is sublime, and he has one of the more picturesque righty swings in all of pro baseball, featuring a big, slow leg kick that eventually ignites his deft, explosive hands. He has great plate coverage and hits with power to all fields. Mountcastle swings a lot: He has a 4.5% career walk rate, and it's rare for DH/LF sorts to walk that little and be star-level performers.

Rutledge has some of the best stuff on Earth, working 96--100 in most outings and mixing in a 65- or 70-grade slider with a curveball a notch below that. His changeup flashes average but is clearly a fourth option, and his command flashes average at times, but should always be somewhat of an issue given his size. Refining the command to be good enough to let his stuff work over long outings is the main development issue here, but it's worth noting that some clubs were scared off of Rutledge's medical in the draft, which most notably included surgery on both hips. This could go down the ""no one can throw that hard, be that big, and be a healthy 200-inning starter"" road, and see Rutledge become a potential closer, or the ""how did anyone pass on this offensive lineman with Syndergaard's stuff"" path, and get immediate whoopsies from the industry, much like Nate Pearson has so far.

Kay's fastball ticked up and now sits at about 93 mph instead of peaking there, and his two-plane curveball got better. His once-dominant changeup regressed but is still comfortably average, and he has great feel for locating it down, and to his arm side.

He got especially hot over a nine-game stretch at Hi-A, where he walked just eight over 49 innings. I still have McClanahan evaluated as a reliever.

He was a bigger, more physical signee than is typical for the international market, the sort most teams would not hesitate to debut in domestic rookie ball. And like Rodriguez, the Mariners allowed Marte to spend his first pro summer dominating competition that simply didn't challenge him (the average DSL fastball velo last year was 88 mph), which led to a .309/.371/.511 line. Marte had a chance to earn an aggressive assignment with a great 2020 spring (probably not Low-A, but perhaps a summer Northwest League placement), putting him on a relative fast track for a teenage hitter, though like the rest of baseball, that possibility in now on hold.   From an individual tools and skills perspective, Marte's peers are elite high school players. As an amateur, there was uncertainty surrounding his hands, actions, and general ability to stay on the infield, but pro looks have been more favorable, backed by enough arm strength to hide potential future range deficiencies. My previous research into shortstop size has shown that most teenage prospects gain about 30 pounds between when they're 18 and 21 years old, which puts Marte's baseline body projection in the Willy Adames/Trevor Story realm, or about 210 pounds. So long as his hands have indeed improved, that's a pretty favorable comp for his body/range-based fit at short. It means there's Goldilocks Zone power/defensive spectrum potential here, as Marte already has 50-grade raw power at age 18 and will probably have at least a full grade more at maturity. His TrackMan power metrics (they're over on The Board) are in the 40/45 range right now because Marte's swing elements are not always well-timed. They are, however, very athletic. The big leg kick (which Marte is balanced enough to utilize), the little bit of bat wrap to create some loop and lift, and the ability to move the barrel around the zone are all encouraging swing elements, but we really don't know a lot about Marte's bat-to-ball skills right now because he just hasn't faced good pitching yet.

The Red Sox hit the accelerator on his development early (a common occurrence in this system) and sent Mata right to full season ball in 2017 when he was just 18-years old. That gives context to Mata's 2018 struggles; he couldn't throw strikes (he had a 17% walk rate), his stuff was up and down throughout the year, and he dealt with a back injury. Several of those things improved in 2019. More purposeful deployment of a robust, four-pitch mix dropped Mata's walk rate to an acceptable 9%, and his stuff was more consistent even though he missed a month with a shoulder strain. And that stuff? A sinker up to 99 (it won't miss bats, but it's tough to square up), a two-plane breaking ball that he'll throw for strike one or as a putaway pitch, a changeup with movement that mirrors the sinker, and a cutter/slider that Mata is still in the early stages of harnessing.   Because the fastball is more of a sinker, secondary execution and command will be necessary for him to miss as many bats as possible, and there are forces opposing one another when it comes to projecting his command. On the one hand, he's only 20 and has huge stuff. On the other, he's at best a fringe athlete, and has a relieverish delivery. This could break in a number of different ways, but unless Mata keeps getting hurt or his control totally unravels like it did two seasons ago, he's going to be a core part of a big league staff.

Head is ambidextrous, and swings and throws a baseball with his left hand but quarterbacked primarily with his right, occasionally using his left when he rolled out that way. For someone with so little high-level experience, his bat control is remarkable. A pronounced arm bar caused him to be late on some of the good velo I've seen him face but Head's feel for opposite field contact enabled him to strike those pitches with authority anyway. I think he needs polish from a mechanical standpoint, but there's rare natural bat-to-ball proclivity happening here. There's also much more measurable power than I would have guessed -- Head's exit velos last summer were more akin to those of heavy-hitting corner guys his age than someone who looks like a wiry leadoff sort.

He's not projectable and is an average athlete, so there are some limits on his upside. He had a rumored $4 million price tag in the draft, which many thought would push him to college, but he ended up changing his asking price and signing for $2.5 million in the third round after throwing a much higher number out to clubs that almost took him at multiple spots in the first.

Brendan Gawlowski's spring look at Dunn, during which the right-hander sat 92-94 over three innings, is perhaps indicative of the former since Dunn rarely worked with his changeup at a time when most starters are working heavily with their tertiary pitch in preparation for the season. Still, I remain somewhat bullish on Dunn's changeup development. He's had stretches in the past where it's been a plus pitch and it's arguably the best long-term fit with his fastball's tailing/sinking shape. What I'm less optimistic about is Dunn's starter stamina. He looked gassed late last year and while into the mid-90s early, was not throwing as hard in subsequent innings this spring.

It was his second straight injury-riddled campaign, as he missed the spring of 2018 with upper back issues, and performed beneath career norms when he returned (33% K% from 2015-'17, 24% in '18), though in fairness to him, he was a 19-year-old pitching at Double-A for the first time. There was pre-draft consternation regarding McKenzie's frame, which, much like Kevin Durant's coming out of Texas, was so lean that it existed somewhere between ""projectable"" and ""concerningly thin,"" causing some scouts/teams to worry about durability.   In the five years since he was drafted, McKenzie has added five pounds of reported weight (he was listed at 160 on draft day, and is now 165); his fastball, at peak, was 90-93, touching 95 (88-92 in high school) and was 90-94 in camp this spring before the shutdown. The way his delivery and fastball work -- it's deceptive, creates flat angle at the top of the zone, and really carries -- makes me think it'll play at that velocity, and the same is true of McKenzie's curveball, which has good depth depite bad spin rates. He needs to find a third pitch, and hasn't really had a chance to do that for two years because of the injuries. At this point, I think it's more likely to be a slider/cutter than a changeup, which I think would be further along now if it were going to work.   If he can't find a third pitch, I'm not sure what the role is. McKenzie throws a ton of strikes, so you want him to start, but without a viable third offering that's pretty tough. High-leverage relief types typically have a better two-pitch mix than even a healthy McKenzie does, so a single-inning relief role doesn't seem like a great option, and the bulk relief role is often occupied by lower slot changeup guys, not overhand curveball types.

He has generally shown a well-rounded skillset that includes good feel for contact and defense.   How teams value India varies depending on how they contextualize the wrist injury. It could be viewed as a short-term issue that obscured his physical talent in 2019, but some teams are scared by it being described as ""nagging"" and having ended his season, while others just think India's junior year at Florida (the only time he's ever hit for real power), is the anomaly, and don't have him projected as an everyday player either way. I think that, primarily via the contact skills, India profiles as a second-division regular (45 FV) at third, but if the wrist is truly why the power hasn't played, or should he eventually prove capable of playing second base (which is what the Fall League assignment was for), he has a great chance to be a 50.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""46.4""","""51.4""",,,,,"""|""",,,,,,0.0,"""|""",45,40,50,50,50,55,55,45,50,45,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""LAA""",0.500,"""XXX"""

More impressive still, though perhaps not surprising, was that Naylor responded and performed, slashing .243/.313/.421 (good for a 110 wRC+) while dealing with the physical toll of catching 80 games.   Not only has Naylor kept his body in check as a pro (Bo's older brother, Josh, is a bigger guy who is limited on defense, and the amateur side of the industry was somewhat worried Bo might develop in a similar fashion), he's actually more sculpted and athletic now than he was in high school, and he's likely to catch, if unspectacularly, long-term. So long as that remains true, Naylor has a good chance to be an everyday player. His swing's a little grooved, but it is electric and produces big power for anyone, let alone a catcher.

He did most of his damage with the fastball, which is puzzling because Ryan's heater doesn't seem remarkable in any way, even in light of the pitch data I've sourced. He'll touch 96, but sits mostly 90-94 with average underlying components like spin, z-break, and extension. Despite that, Ryan is getting a lot of swinging strikes in the zone with his fastball. Like, a lot, a lot. His arm stroke is curt, and the ball just kind of jumps on hitters, so perhaps that's contributing to its effectiveness, but it's not such a unique look as to satisfactorily explain this level of dominance.   The supporting cast -- a low-70s rainbow curveball, the occasional cutter or changeup -- is only okay, so vanilla that Ryan just pumps his fastball in, pitch after pitch. He used it 73% of the time last year. There's no precedent for that level of usage among big league starters. Based on the way the fastball plays (the whiff rates indicate it's an elite pitch, but based on how big league hitters dealt with it this spring, I have a 60 on it) and Ryan's command, I have him in as a strike-throwing No. 4/5 starter.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""50.0""","""53.6""",,"""|""",0.5000,0.0000,0.0000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2200,2550,50,60,45,50,,45,,60,60,50,50,,45,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

This was the general industry response to early drafts I circulated of my Top 100, which had Lewis toward the back of the 50 FV tier where players like Jose Siri and Monte Harrison have been when they've made the list. Lewis and his knee (he tore his ACL in 2016) finally looked healthy last year (his swing had more movement, a bigger leg kick, and he seemed to be twisting and bending it with more comfort), and his underlying power data, which I'll get to shortly, is spectacular. But in some ways what Lewis' health helped reinforce was skepticism regarding his hit tool. There are folks in baseball who think that on a binary level, Lewis will not hit enough to have a meaningful career. I think he'll be a high-variance big leaguer, grinding through some frustrating, 1-WAR seasons while he clubs 30-plus bombs in others, similar to Jorge Soler, Domingo Santana, and countless other tantalizing toolsheds who strike out a lot.   As for that underlying power data I promised you, Lewis' is very encouraging. If you've been reading this year's lists, you know the Southern League offensive environment was very unkind to hitters last season. A source not with Seattle told me that based on his TrackMan/Statcast data, Lewis' Expected SLG%, was about .100 higher than his actual output, with an xSLG up around .500. He averaged 92 mph off the bat last year and hit 53% of balls in play at 95 mph or above (a 70 on the scale); another source whose team tracked Hard Outs among 2019 minor leaguers (balls in play at 95 mph or up that resulted in outs) told me Lewis made more than 40 of them last year, which was in the top 10 in all the minors. On balance, I think Lewis is a 45, a 1.5 WAR player on average during his years of team control. But he has plus-plus, impact power and could get hot and make some All-Star teams during that span, while other years will be quite lean.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""48.2""","""51.4""",,,,,"""|""",,,,1.0,,0.0,"""|""",35,55,70,50,45,60,40,60,70,45,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""NYM""",0.500,"""XXX"""

Several repertoire changes, two trades (and the scrutiny that comes with that), fluctuations in his walk rate, some injuries (most notably shoulder stiffness in 2018), and mixed performance at the upper levels have caused a constant need for re-evaluation. The latest of these many developments is a logical shift, given Sheffield's sinker-friendly arm slot, to a two-seam look on the fastball. Sheffield's 2020 spring velo was parked in the 89-93 range, but now his fastball has more tailing/sinking action, which dovetails very nicely with the shape of his slider. Sheffield will throw a shorter, curt slider in the zone for strikes (one scout source who saw Sheff this spring thought it might be a separate cutter) and a longer, nastier, bat-missing version that finishes out of the strike zone. This pitch is plus, and was used heavily in Sheffield's electric spring outings, especially as a back foot out-pitch to righties.   Sheffield's changeup is also good, but his arm side command of all his pitches is not, so whether he'll be able to consistently set up the change with well-located fastballs is in doubt. So, too, is Sheffield's ability to eat innings like a traditional starter because of his hot and cold strike throwing. Some teams just have him projected in the bullpen because of how erratic the strikes have been historically.

The tweak brought his groundball rate closer to average (50% previously, down to 42% in 2019) and more than doubled his home run output from the prior year.   It's necessary progress for a player who began a long-anticipated fall down the defensive spectrum, and will likely continue to do so. Vilade began seeing time at third base in 2019, and was taking reps in the outfield during the Rockies' fall workouts. He looked noticeably bigger and stronger on the Salt River backfields than he did during the summer, and we now anticipate Vilade will branch out and play both outfield and infield corners, which makes sense considering how entrenched Nolan Arenado is at third base.

Toro is short-levered and tightly-wound, not the loose, rotational athlete most scouts like.

It's a pretty well-rounded contact/doubles power/OBP profile even though Toro presents an atypical look.   The same is true of Toro's defense. When he has the time to really step into a throw, he uncorks rockets, but he's not the kind of athlete who can make strong throws in tough situations.

He returned over a month later and threw hard down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. And that's where Hankins' velocity was in 2019. In 70-to-80 pitch outings, he sat 93-96, topping out at 97, albeit with worse control than he had as a high schooler. At various points as an amateur Hankins appeared to utilize either a slider or curveball, and now he uses both. They are better demarcated now then when he was an amateur and both flash plus when located. With Hankins' arm slot, the secondary pitch that best mirrors his fastball (which has tailing action because of his slot) is actually the changeup.   Hankins has gotten a little soft-bodied since signing and I wonder if it has impacted his athleticism and control, but he was also working to tweak his lower half usage to help him get on top of his breaking ball, which might have affected his mechanical consistency last year.

Hoese was the 2019 case. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38:30 BB/K ratio. He was handled with care by the Dodgers after he signed, spending a lot of time in the AZL and DH'ing due to wrist and forearm tendinitis. He dealt with more wrist trouble this spring and had just been totally cleared and begun throwing to bases a week before the shutdown.   Hoese's exit velo data was way down in pro ball, something I'm dismissing because of the injury and therefore excluding from The Board (his college avg/max was 88/104, pro was 84/100). He's not tooled up and doesn't have huge raw power or bat speed, even with a healthy wrist. Instead he's a very athletic swinger whose swing is geared for airborne contact. That should help him get to power in games even though there's not huge raw.

He is one of the more talented offensive catching prospects in the minors thanks to a potent combination of power and barrel feel. When Feliciano puts balls in play, they're very often scorched -- just under 50% of the balls he hit last year entered play at 95 mph or above, which is a 65 on the 20-80 scale if you curve out big leaguers' hard hit rates. All of that seems likely to be hampered by Feliciano's hedonistic approach. The dude likes to swing, and has only walked at a 6% clip as a pro.   Scouts also have tepid opinions about his defense, but let's remember that he's essentially a JUCO-aged player who missed a year of development due to injury. I anticipate some defensive improvement, and think we'll have a electronic strike zone a year or two after Feliciano hits the 40-man, which will help him stay back there.

He was wrapped up in the Braves' international indiscretions and had his deal with the club voided by MLB. (The <em>New York Times</em> reported that although Bae had agreed to sign for $300,000, the Braves planned to pay him an additional $600,000 by reallocating money promised to other signees to him.) Because he had skipped the KBO's draft to sign with an MLB team, the KBO barred him from signing with any South Korean pro team for two years. When he hit the market again, Bae signed with Pittsburgh for $1.25 million. He was found guilty of and later suspended for assaulting his former girlfriend in an incident that occurred on New Year's Eve 2017. After the suspension and a treatment/education program, Bae returned to the field and was skipped over two levels and sent to full-season ball at age 19, where he hit .323/.403/.430.   His domestic assault conviction impacts how teams (and people, in general) view, value, and interact with him, but purely on talent, some clubs think he belonged on my top 100 list. Bae's arm may prevent him from playing shortstop, but if that's the case he'll still fit at second base and he has the speed to play center field. It's possible his lack of power hurts his on-base skills as he climbs the minors and pitchers attack him without fear of him doing extra-base damage (he has no minor league home runs yet), but Bae's gotten stronger, his exit velos took a leap last year, and he has premium rotational ability.

His stock and performance peaked in late-March, then dipped closer to the draft when he failed to get through five or more innings in five of his last eight starts. He was sitting 91-95 in 30-pitch outings after he signed, and his slider spin rate spiked once the Rays got hold of him.

Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him.

The carry on his fastball enables Cantillo to compete for swinging strikes in the zone, and that, plus his ability to throw lots of competitively-located changeups mean he can work back into any count.

Moniak has filled out and the raw power looks like it's going to settle close to average, based on sourced exit velos and my Fall League looks (which weren't good until the last week or two).

There are several potential solutions. He might be able to just bully the extra velocity past hitters in a relief role, or he may eventually lean into the sink/tail aspects of the fastball and work off a two-seamer (Julio Teheran is actually a pretty clean athlete/delivery comp for Gutierrez), or the new dev regime might tweak something -- perhaps his hand position or stride direction -- to try to shape how the fastball moves.   My high speed video from the spring shows a four-seam grip with pretty lousy seam uniformity and an axis like the one the 2019 data indicates, and Gutierrez was still doing towel drills this spring, so I assume the new dev group hasn't really touched him yet.

There's also raw power upside if there's more physical development and a possible loft/swing adjustment, and that now seems more likely given how advanced, instinctual, and coachable he's proven to be so far. There's a good bit more variability here than you'd expect for a college hitter with a three-year major conference track record, so the first half of 2020 will let us know if there's more helium left in this balloon.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""40.5""","""51.4""",,,,,"""|""",,,,,,0.0,"""|""",35,30,45,55,50,55,55,40,50,55,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,

Molina was nearly 40 then, while Kirk -- 5-foot-8, 265 pounds -- is only 21, and it's hard to predict what will happen to his build and agility as he ages into his 20s, because pro athletes like this (John Daly, maybe?) don't really exist.   His age makes the statistical track record even more impressive, though, especially when you consider that Kirk missed a year due to a hand injury and has been young for every level at which he's raked. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks. He's a 20-grade waddler from base to base, and even visual evaluations of his swing (which features conservative footwork) are mixed despite his numbers. He can turn on balls in and hit balls hard the other way, but this isn't like Andrew Vaughn, who scouts will acknowledge has defensive limitations and whose mobility they'll knock, but about whose athleticism in the batter's box they all rave.

In a small spring sample, it appeared to be working -- Arias played some spring games in the place of Fernando Tatis Jr., who was one of several Padres to miss time with flu-like symptoms during the spring (tugs collar) before baseball shut down. The importance of Arias' approach extends beyond his on base ability to his power production. His swing is grooved, making the parts of the zone where he can do real damage limited, so for Arias to get to his power in games he's not only going to have to recognize balls and strikes, but also learn what he can actually hit.

Perhaps more surprising than the velocity, which we had been primed to see, was how well Martinez executed his breaking ball over his next couple of outings.

He's shown opposite field thump, which impresses some scouts though others argue his inside-out contact spray indicates a swing flaw. To possess premium bat speed and face pitching in the 80s but still inside-out home runs suggests that Schnell has been late on subpar stuff, and his deep hand load, which helps create the power, also creates a ton of length back to the ball. It's still too early to say definitively that this is a problem, in part because Schnell hasn't played many pro games yet due to injuries, which he has a history of (a broken bone in his right wrist in 2018, minor surgery on his right knee in April of 2019 to correct an ailment he described as stemming from wear and tear).

If there's an Oliver Drake delivery comp in the minors, it's Lazar (though he gets much lower to the ground), and like Drake, he can somehow turn over a changeup from this arm slot. We've seen fastballs thrive despite mediocre velocity before. Often it's from someone who has an extremely vertical arm slot, like Drake or Josh Collmenter, or huge extension and a flat approach angle, like Yusmeiro Petit, guys who can successfully remove the table cloth without disturbing the place settings. Lazar has both of these, and has a bat-missing changeup, too.

There are some similarities between Romero and Red Sox left-hander Jay Groome: While they've both been dogged by makeup issues and TJ surgery, everything seems to be trending the right direction now. Both are 40 FVs at the moment but could be 50s by the end of the year if everything comes together.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,,"""48.9""","""55.6""",,"""|""",0.5000,0.0000,0.0000,,,0.0,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,2300,2300,40,60,45,,55,,,50,60,55,,60,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX"""

After three straight years of big time slugging performance, Hernandez's output dipped in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League. Some of this was due to the hitting environment; some of it was due to more advanced pitchers understanding how to attack him to limit damage. Hernandez's swing cuts down through the typical hitting zone and his power is out in front when his swing starts to lift, which makes his point of impact of paramount importance to his power production. There are mixed opinions as to whether this is correctable.

Most of the physical tools are intact, Cabello's swing just looked out of whack, and he was coming off of a dislocated shoulder that truncated his 2019. His front side was leaking way down the third base line (which happened during his incredible 2018, too), and his swing was described as long to me, which is odd for a hitter this size.   This is still a rare blend of skills, especially if catching is ever revisited. Cabello still runs well, and last year he inspired one of my favorite scout quotes of all time when I was told that he has a ""grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat."" In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength, and what was billed as above-average raw power that hasn't shown in the exit velos yet.

He was graceful, projectable, and already had average big league stuff almost two years before he was even eligible to be drafted. That stuff just kept improving, peaking the summer before his draft year when Groome would work 92-96 mph in short stints with an easy, plus curveball while folding in an average to above changeup, doing so with a big, athletic frame and starter's delivery, all of which led to him being mentioned as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But a myriad of concerns unrelated to Groome's talent dogged him more than most prep prospects, most of them stemming from an unstable living situation that involved drugs and guns, for which his father was later arrested. That, combined with a quickly thickening frame and issues with his commitment to Vanderbilt, contributed to his fall out of the top 10 picks of the 2016 draft.   Since signing, Groome hasn't been on the mound much, making just 20 total pro starts due to a back injury and, eventually, Tommy John surgery. He came back from TJ late last August and got four innings of work before instructional league, where he got another eight to 10 frames, working 93-95 two innings at a time. Groome is Rule 5 eligible next winter and he's never thrown more than 55 innings in any of his four pro seasons. Those two things create some pressure and make it likely that the Red Sox either really need to push him next year, creating more risk that he'll get hurt yet again, or that he'll just be bullpen'd to give him a better shot at contributing in 2021.

He'd need to be a plus shortstop defender to profile as a low-end regular, and while he has looked like it at times, it hasn't been consistent, and the Rays began moving him all over the infield late last year. As a switch-hitter who's better from the right side (his numbers have been much better as a righty bat the last couple years), I think Fox will play some sort of multi-positional, shorter half of a platoon role while also pinch running. If you think he's a low-end regular at short, then he's a 45 FV, but I think it'll be hard for him to be more than a 1-WAR role player without any impact in the bat.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""40.9""","""45.5""",,,,,"""|""",,,,2.0,,0.0,"""|""",40,30,40,60,45,55,50,30,40,60,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""ARI""",0.500,"""XXX"""

But for now, he also has a non-zero chance to stay at short and hit for a ton of power. His bat speed and physicality are both impressive for a such a young player.

Based on this, Toronto pushed him to an affiliate quickly, and he pitched at Bluefield as a 17-year-old in 2018, his first pro summer. He dealt with injuries throughout 2019 and his stuff was very average, with the fastball resting in the 90-93 range. He had elbow soreness during the spring of 2019, pitched in Extended for a while, got to Lansing late, made seven starts, then was shut down in mid-August. His elbow barked at him again this spring and Pardinho had Tommy John in mid-February.   What made Pardinho appealing as an amateur -- his polish and potential to move quickly -- is now gone after the two years impacted by injury, and it's been a while since his stuff was exciting.

Here's the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that elbow. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 -- as a comical aside, Eloy Jimnez is listed at 205) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they'd like him to play the outfield, he's one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man.   Adolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he's had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few, injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he's been a hedonistic free swinger. He's run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017.

If there's a reason to project on the defense it's because Bracho just hasn't had many pro reps at second base yet. Except for a little bit of Extended spring action, he missed all of 2018 with a broken arm and then lost a month of 2019 to an oblique injury. Based on what I've seen from Bracho, Shed Long and Nick Solak are two similarly-skilled potential precedents to watch to see how they're deployed/hidden on defense in order to get their bats in the lineup.   Bracho can really hit. He's patient and poised. He'll take giant hacks in hitter's counts and more measured ones when he's adjusting to a breaking ball or just trying to put a ball in play. There's not a lot of body projection here despite Bracho's age. He's got a square, 5-foot-11-ish frame and is already physically mature. The offensive profile is tied to the combination of approach and feel for contact, which should enable Bracho to hit for power in games even though he doesn't project to have premium raw.

But he's also got above-average raw power, plus speed, and can play shortstop (he was listed as an outfielder on the instructs roster but did not play), so he can still be a valuable player even if the bat falls short of average and his ceiling is sizable if it gets better than that.

He went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts.   In the few intervening years, Beer has continued to perform, his numbers slowly trending down as he reached his draft year at Clemson, then pro ball for a year with Houston before they shipped him to Arizona as part of the Zack Greinke trade. He's now 23 and has a .294/.388/.508 career line in the minors. He reached Double-A in his first pro season. These are all good signs, and we're almost certain Beer will be a solid big league role player relatively soon -- we just can't speak to what his shelf life will be and don't think his ceiling is in the Rhys Hoskins/Pete Alonso realm at all.""","""|""",,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,"""|""",,,"""|""","""38.2""","""44.5""",,,,,"""|""",,,,-2.0,,0.0,"""|""",35,40,60,20,30,45,40,55,60,20,40,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,"""KC""",0.500,"""XXX"""

So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot with velocity more in the mid-90s, where his arm action is also more naturally online, than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder.   Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Vctor Vctor Mesa workout in Marlins Park, where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience.

He has deft, all-fields contact ability and can (kind of) play an up-the-middle position. Quiroz presents rare 40-man flexibility because he's arguably ready to contribute to a big league lineup right now, but because of how recently he signed, he doesn't have to occupy a 40-man spot until this December.
