The short answer is; at the nhl level, teams cannot sustain a higher quality possession game, relative to other teams. I think this phenomena is similar to goaltending talent, but for coaching. We don't observe a significant difference, because the overall high quality washes any difference in potential difference in skill. Coaches make sure to squeeze every ounce of quality out of possession. The high level washes out any potential advantage."""

I won't be ""training"" him at all, really. Here are the rules I'd laid out:    1) It must be his idea. No dragging him to the park to hit unwanted batting practice or throw or field grounders. If he wants to do it, I will make myself available as best as possible.    2) It has to be fun. If it's not fun, we're not doing it. No reason to hate the game at age 9 because your father makes the game terrible.    3) Everything will be done at full intensity and speed, with errors/mistakes not counting. Praise will be heaped on him for swinging out of his shoes and throwing a ball as far as possible 60 degrees away from the target. There is a limited time in youth athletes to develop speed, power, and intent. Sacrificing those for present-day success is the fastest track to stalling out later in life. It also teaches poor life lessons; namely that passion is something that should be routinely derailed for what's important right now - a clear lack of understanding how delayed gratification plays a role in learning, making, and doing.    3a) I will rarely throw balls overhand at him at anything less than 80% of my arm strength (admittedly nothing special, but to a 3 year old, pretty fast). I don't throw balls and nail him in the face with a 65 MPH heater of course, but I throw them against a fence/tarp/net comfortably away from his body, which he picks up and then hits/throws back. I never want him to associate overhand throwing with ""easing it in there."" Underhand throws for field work is fine, overhand is not.    4) He has to bat left and throw right. (Kidding, but he already grips the bat left-handed. Why ruin a good thing?)"""

How can they predictably drop off in Sh% while dominating shot diff, for example? What's the difference between regular season and playoffs? Is it as simple as ""no pretty goals in the playoffs - you've gotta work harder""? Probably not. And obviously, the competition is better in playoffs. But one difference no one really talks about between regular season and playoffs is coaching and, specifically, opponent-specific preparation. During the regular season, there's very limited practice time and almost no opponent-specific prep. This isn't the NFL, where you get a week. So you can win a lot of games in the regular season on a skill advantage and a novel wrinkle on your PP or what have you. In the playoffs, however, it's a lot of team-specific prep. So it stands to reason that better coaches (and staffs) fare better. And that's part of why you saw the Leafs (Babcock) give the Caps some trouble early. Ditto PIT, to an extent. But Caps adjusted in both. Anyway, people talk about the *what* of the difference between regular season and playoffs (in vague terms), but not so much the *why* of it. And I think a big piece of that *why* that people miss is the difference in opponent specific prep. Might be biggest area of coaching impact."""

2017-11-30,"""Jason Ochart (@JasonOchart)""","""Sports(Baseball)""","""Twitter""",,"""An interesting thing happened the other day. Our hitters were hitting 88 mph cutters from the pitching machine. A pro hitter was hitting very well, so I told him ""well done! You're hitting those cutters very well, I'm impressed"" He responded with ""oh those are cutters?"" He didn't realize he was hitting cutters. His next round was pure yip salad, he swung and missed half the pitches, was consistently late and had a terrible round. It didn't make any sense to me, and it's been on my mind. My thoughts are that his brain was able to couple an action(swing) with the perception (incoming pitch) naturally just because he is an elite athlete and mover. This happened subconsciously, as is ideal. But once he was made aware of the pitch, he began to deliberately think about swinging to where a cutter moves. He began to try to override his motor system's method of attaching a movement solution to a movement problem by consciously making the adjustment perceived to be needed. Some of the best hitters I've ever coached have no idea what pitch they hit after at bats. Or when I'd tell them that I picked the pitcher's pitches and will give them verbals, they say they don't want them. It used to confuse me a lot. So I guess the take away is that we have to be careful about where we direct the attention of a hitter. If a guy is flowing and hitting well, the best thing to do is leave them alone. Saying nothing is often the best thing to say. As a matter of fact, telling a hitter what he's doing well (especially physically) when they are doing well is likely a good way to screw them up if they aren't capable or trained to deal with that information productively."""

Not going to lie, I'm pretty sad at the state of the league today. To borrow again from Gartner, 3.5 years ago, we hit the ""Peak of Inflated Expectations"". We are now massively in the ""Trough of Disillusionment"", and I don't see us digging out for a while. I'm hopelessly biased because he's a long time friend of mine, but man, Sunny Mehta is a top tier NHL GM, and instead of seeing him work his magic, we watch a bunch of guys whose dads were famous stumble around like Hans Moleman's kids. We still have 27 GMs who are there because they played pro or their dads are famous. The other three: Lou (no longer an outsider) and the mysterious John Chayka and Jeff Gorton. In today's NHL, any team that spends to cap should be a 93-point team. Literally, VGK, assembled from useless scraps, is that good. So you can make BizNasty2.0 your GM and he'll probably make the playoffs if you give him that much cash. In fact, no GM has really shown any deterministic talent for building a good team. Every GM has either relied on good drafting after being bad, or great legacies. What I find unfortunate, is that nobody has had the guts to break through this. There is so much untapped value in the NHL, you can find a GM who will win the cup at the salary floor. You can't do that by picking up guys who have the aura of being a 2nd line center and who coach knew in Moose Jaw. It's a recipe for being no better than anybody else.     I thought this was worth addressing. Steve Yzerman got his job because he's Steve Yzerman, Hall of Fame hockey player.
