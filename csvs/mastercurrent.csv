His enormous talent was obvious the following year during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Appalachian League- and then even more so during his full-season debut in 2017- when- at age 18- Guerrero produced a .323/.425/.485 line with 13 homers between Class A Lansing and Class A Advanced Dunedin. He earned Midwest League All-Star honors in the process- as well as a trip to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in July before a torrid second half in the Florida State League.  Much like his father- Vlad Jr. has an elite ability to barrel the ball from the right side of the plate and generates effortless plus raw power to all fields with his combination of bat speed- physical strength and hand-eye coordination. His plate discipline is also impressive- as he accrued more walks (76) than strikeouts (62) in 2017 to finish among the Minor League leaders in on-base percentage. Moved from the outfield to third base before the season- Guerrero shows glimpses of becoming a passable defender there in spite of having below-average speed and range. His arm strength has developed into another above-average tool since signing.  As a future plus hitter with at least 30-homer potential- Guerrero boasts the offensive profile of a perennial All-Star and possible MVP candidate in his prime. Retaining his athleticism without becoming too bulky could pose a challenge for Guerrero moving forward- though obviously he has the requisite offensive profile to support a move to first base or left field.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0pq1nJRuxC4?autoplay=1,,|,1073,73,200,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - TOR,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,40,40,65,40,40,60,65,70,70,30,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,80,65,45,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 65 | Run: 70 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 70  Acuna's grandfather- a pitcher- and father- a fellow outfielder- played pro ball but never reached the big leagues. After a 2017 season that saw him play- and dominate- across three levels up to Triple-A- there's little question the 20-year-old phenom will easily surpass the two previous generations in his family. He capped his remarkable year off by winning MVP honors in the Arizona Fall League.  It's hard to find a flaw in Acuna's game. He has a buggy whip of a swing and ultra-fast hands that allow him to make hard contact to all fields. His power started showing up- and then some- in 2017- and seeing his 21 homers be a low mark in his career does not sound outlandish. While he did strike out a bit- his K rate did go down each time he moved up the Braves' ladder- with an advanced approach especially given his age. He can flat-out fly- allowing him to make 40-plus steals an annual projection- especially as he gets better at reading pitchers and cutting down his caught stealing rate. That speed works for him in the outfield as well- where he has the range for center and the arm for right field.   While Acuna was in A ball just a year ago- he's ready to break through to the big leagues. Even if the Braves are extra-cautious- no one doubts he will make a big impact in the immediate future- with an almost limitless ceiling.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/jM2RtuJ_TJM?autoplay=1,,|,1869,72,180,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,J2 2014,Venezuela,July 2- 2014 - ATL,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,50,50,65,60,45,70,55,65,70,55,50,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,65,70,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

He built on that success during his full-season debut- earning midseason All-Star honors in the South Atlantic League before moving up to the Carolina League. The 2017 season featured even more accolades for Robles- as he garnered All-Star honors in his return to the Carolina League in 2017 before moving up to Double-A and earning his first big league callup in September at age 20. Robles' performance earned him a spot on the Nats' playoff roster- and he gained even more experience after the season in the Arizona Fall League.   Robles possesses off-the-charts athleticism as well as five standout tools that he showcases on a daily basis. He has the makings of plus hitter from the right side of the plate- with a compact but explosive swing and a present feel for using the whole field. His power played consistently in 2017 thanks to a more leveraged swing and better pitch selection- and the result was a career-best 10 home runs and 58 extra-base hits across three levels. Robles' approach and strike-zone judgment are also mature- while his tendency to hold his ground in the batter's box has led to high hit-by-pitch totals throughout his career. A plus-plus runner- Robles impacts games with his wheels on the bases as well as in center field- where he has exceptional range and instincts as well as arm strength that's among the best in the Minors at the position.  From his athleticism to his immense physical tools and his baseball savvy- Robles has the makings of becoming a true franchise player for the Nationals- one who has the upside of a perennial All-Star and possibly an MVP candidate.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/3VwXSd7XgXo?autoplay=1,,|,1413,72,190,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2013 - WSH,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,55,35,40,70,60,70,70,45,50,70,70,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,75,70,70,|,,,,,,,,

He made an immediate impact in his pro debut- finishing the season as a 17-year-old in the Class A Short-Season Northwest League- and then emerged as a top-flight prospect in 2017 as he became the first 18-year-old in Midwest League history to post at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. Perhaps even more impressive was how Tatis Jr. handled himself after making the jump directly to Double-A San Antonio in August- as the performance further certified his status as one of baseball's premier prospects.   Tatis Jr. has all the ingredients to become an offensive force in the Majors- as his bat speed- leveraged swing and overall capacity to make adjustments all portend a future plus hitter with plus power. He proved vulnerable to spin and sequencing early in the year but tightened his approach as the season progressed en route to pacing the Midwest League with 75 walks. Many evaluators believe Tatis Jr. is merely scraping the surface of his offensive potential- as he still has considerable room to grow into his tall and athletic frame.   That larger frame doesn't currently impede Tatis Jr.'s abilities at shortstop- where he makes highlight-reel plays on a daily basis thanks to his athleticism- range and rocket arm- though further physical development could ultimately force him to third base. Even if that's case- Tatis Jr.'s bat gives him the ceiling of a perennial All-Star- possibly even an MVP candidate in his prime.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/f-7iDniIWf0?autoplay=1,,|,1096,75,185,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - CWS,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,60,55,50,60,55,60,70,45,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,60,50,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

He emerged as one of baseball's best prospects in 2016- when he starred at the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in San Diego- topped the Midwest League in slugging (.532) and OPS (.901) and won the Class A circuit's MVP award at age 19. Despite missing the first six weeks of 2017 with a bone bruise on his right shoulder- he posted better numbers and kicked his game up a notch further (.348/.405/.635 in 47 games) after getting traded to the White Sox in July as part of a four-prospect package for Jose Quintana. Jimenez began 2018 on the disabled list with a strained left pectoral muscle.  Jimenez has few peers among prospects when it comes to hitting for average and power. His massive raw pop- generated with impressive bat speed and leverage from the right side of the plate- earns him comparisons to Giancarlo Stanton. He recognizes pitches well- makes savvy adjustments- doesn't try to do too much and is making progress with his plate discipline.  Though Jimenez may not offer much beyond his bat- he still can become a superstar. As he has gotten bigger and stronger- he has slowed and now has below-average speed. His arm strength also has regressed and he recorded just six assists in his first four pro seasons- so he now projects as a fringy left fielder.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/qzcfGawJz30?autoplay=1,,|,21,76,205,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,Aug. 1- 2013 - CHC,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,30,50,70,45,45,60,50,70,80,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,70,40,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

Either way hes one of the top prospects in baseball. ETA late 2018 (UPDATE: slight grade boost to match placement on Top 175 list),Scouting grades: Hit: 70 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 65  Billed as the top pure hitter in the 2016 Draft class- especially from the college ranks- the hope was Senzel would be the type who could move quickly through a farm system. After the Tennessee product went No. 2 overall to the Reds- he's lived up to that billing- hitting his way to Double-A in his first full season and actually hitting better once he got to that advanced level.  Senzel uses a combination of strength- bat speed and an advanced approach at the plate to be an extremely dangerous hitter from the right side of the plate. He makes consistent hard contact- doesn't strike out a lot and draws walks- which points to a future of hitting over .300 and perhaps competing for batting titles. While he's not a pure power type- he did have 57 extra-base hits in 2017 and homered 10 times in 209 at-bats in Double-A. He's not a burner on the basepaths- but he is very aggressive and has excellent instincts that allow him to pick up some steals and take extra bases. His plus arm works very well from the hot corner and he's worked to improve his hands and footwork and can stay there long-term- though the Reds planned to try him out at different positions to increase his versatility.  There isn't much more for Senzel to prove at the Minor League level- with the prevailing thought he could compete in the big leagues in the very near future. Some more reps at the upper levels certainly won't hurt- but he should be ready when the call comes.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/1Jkza_J-9MU?autoplay=1,,|,1703,73,205,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,1st rd 2016,Tennessee,,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,55,40,55,55,45,55,70,55,55,55,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,55,55,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 65 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 60  The Astros rated Whitley higher than any high school pitcher in the 2016 Draft and got him at No. 17 overall -- the sixth one selected -- for a $3-148-000 bonus. Their assessment looks spot on so far- as no Minor Leaguer who worked as many as his 92 1/3 innings in 2017 exceeded his strikeout rate of 13.9 per nine innings. He posted a 1.84 ERA in four August outings in Double-A- joining Zack Greinke- Chad Billingsley- Clayton Kershaw and Dylan Bundy as the only prep first-round arms this century to advance to that level in their first full pro season. However- his progress will slow down after he drew a 50-game suspension in February for violating the Minor League drug program.  Whitley can miss bats with all four of his pitches. His best is his fastball- a nasty combination of velocity (92-97 mph)- cutting and running action plus steep downhill plane. After doing a terrific job as a high school senior of trimming what had been a soft body- he has room to add more strength and could throw harder once he does.  Whitley backs up his heater with a hard 12-to-6 curveball- a power slider that flashes late bite and a fading changeup that he already trusts. Though he has good body control for a young pitcher with a huge frame- Houston had him pitch exclusively out of the stretch at times last season to have him focus on repeating his delivery. He already does a nice job of throwing strikes and should become an ace if he can refine his command.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/3dPGupFsWFY?autoplay=1,,|,1691,79,195,|,HOU,hou,HOU,,,1st rd 2016,Alamo Heights HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,55,60,55,50,,,45,70,60,60,60,55,,,55,|,,,,,,|,65,55,65,55,,,,50

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 60 | Overall: 60  A jump in velocity heading into his senior year in high school put Keller more firmly on the Draft prospect map in 2014 and landed him in the second round- where the Pirates went above pick value to sign the Iowa prepster away from his North Carolina commitment. His pro career started slowly- as he missed most of 2015 with a forearm strain- but while he missed some of 2017 with a back issue- he still reached Double-A at age 21- dominated in the playoffs there and then capped things off as one of the best pitching prospects in the Arizona Fall League.  Keller has an exciting combination of stuff plus command. He can sit in the 93-96 mph range and touch 97-98 mph without much effort with his fastball and commands it extremely well. He'll throw it with excellent life down in the zone- both missing bats and inducing weak ground-ball contact. His 11-to-5 curve flashes plus as well. His changeup has long been his third pitch- but it's improved and he showed a solid one while working on it during his AFL stint. He throws all of his pitches for strikes- continues to refine his ability to game plan and does an outstanding job of staying away from walks and home runs.  Keller just needs a little more development time at the upper levels of the system to sharpen his secondary pitches in order to be ready to impact a big league rotation. At worst- he looks like a solid No. 3- but he has the chance to be more than that in the future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/BbF8a3acDUU?autoplay=1,,|,737,75,195,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,2nd rd 2014,Xavier HS (IA),,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,55,,,,,55,60,45,60,,,,,70,|,,,,,,|,65,50,55,,,,,60

He ranked as the low Class A Midwest League's best prospect and won a championship in the high Class A Carolina League during his first full pro season in 2015- then got traded to the Yankees as the key piece in the Aroldis Chapman trade in mid-2016. He capped that year by becoming the youngest MVP and batting champion (.403) in Arizona Fall League history and was pushing for a big league promotion last summer at age 20 before injuring his non-throwing elbow in a play at the plate- requiring Tommy John surgery that ended his 2017 season in mid-June.  Torres has exceptionally quick hands that allow him to excel from the right side of the plate and make plays in the field. Always an advanced hitter for his age- he recognizes pitches well- uses the entire field and has improved his walk and strikeout rates in each of his seasons in full-season ball. He makes adjustments easily and also has hit for more power each year as well as he has gotten stronger- projecting as a hitter who can contend for batting titles while providing 20-plus homers annually.  Though he's just an average runner- Torres covers enough ground to stick at shortstop and has the hands and arm to be a solid defender there. With Didi Gregorius entrenched at shortstop in New York- the Yankees played Torres regularly at second and third base in 2017.

While Bo didn't come off the board quite as early as his brother- his impressive hitting ability still got him an above-slot signing bonus of $1-100-000 as Toronto's second-round pick. He put on a hitting clinic in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League after signing- batting a robust .427/.451/.732 in 22 games- and then did so once again across two full-season levels in 2017- when he paced all Minor League hitters with a .362 average and captured Midwest League MVP honors.  Bichette proved an advanced hitter during his amateur career- and his raw power was on display when he won the Under Armour All-American Game home run derby in Chicago. He combines plus bat speed with a violent-but-controlled swing to produce tons of hard contact from line to line- and scouts like his chances of becoming a plus-or-better hitter with above-average power. He's an average runner with good range and instincts at shortstop- and the Blue Jays plan to keep him at the position for as long as they can. Some believe he's best suited for second or third base- or perhaps even left field- but so far he's passed every test at his natural position.  Much like his teammate and friend Vladimir Guerrero Jr.- there seems to be no limit to Bichette's offensive ceiling. His career-to-date points to a bright future as a perennial All-Star who could regularly compete for batting titles.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/lRUNUyhGHkM?autoplay=1,,|,1661,72,200,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,2nd rd 2016,Lakewood HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,65,45,45,55,50,60,70,45,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,55,50,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

Part of the same Plant High (Tampa) program that produced Hall of Famer Wade Boggs- he was considered the best hitter in that year's prep class. His bat stood out more than his power early in his pro career- then he got more aggressive in 2017 and smashed 25 homers while reaching Double-A at age 20.  Tucker has an unconventional left-handed swing- but he makes it work with his bat speed and his uncanny hand-eye coordination. He recognizes pitches well and makes contact more easily than most players with his power potential. He has a solid plan at the plate and traded some patience for pop last year- slugging .528 after recording a .408 mark in his first two seasons.  While Tucker's offensive prowess could make him a star- he has the chance for average or better tools across the board once Houston moves him to an outfield corner. Though he spent most of his first two full seasons in center field- his average speed and circuitous routes aren't a great fit there. He has solid arm strength and projects as a right fielder at the big league level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/z84M9j2JoEc?autoplay=1,,|,1238,76,190,|,HOU,hou,HOU,,,1st rd 2015,Plant HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,35,40,65,45,40,55,65,60,65,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,60,50,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

He won the ERA crown in the Gulf Coast League for his U.S. debut in 2016- then dominated in his first taste of full-season ball and earned a promotion up to the Florida State League just after his 19th birthday for an encore.   It's hard not to get excited about Sanchez's combination of pure stuff and feel for pitching. While he is just six feet tall- he's strong and athletic with a repeatable delivery that points to a future in a rotation. He can hit triple digits with his four-seam fastball and also features a two-seamer with a ton of sinking action. His fastball is better than its pure velocity because of its movement as well as his ability to command it extremely well. His secondary stuff continues to improve- with a breaking ball he adds and subtracts from and a changeup he shows a good feel for at times. Both will flash above-average to plus- and given his overall feel for pitching- there is confidence both will get there consistently in time.  The Phillies have understandably limited Sanchez's workload to date- but the right-hander could start forcing their hand soon. Seeing him in the Philadelphia rotation- with an ultimate ceiling to potentially lead it one day- by 2019 seems a distinct possibility.,,,,,|,1850,72,185,|,PHI,phi,PHI,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,Feb. 20- 2015 - PHI,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,55,50,45,,,,45,70,65,55,50,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,70,55,55,,,,,60

The native of Elizabeth- N.J.- who moved to the Dominican Republic in order to sign as an international free agent in 2012- had hit some stumbling blocks- including a shoulder issue in 2015 and a drug suspension in 2016- before rebounding to make a big league impact that season. Poised to establish himself in 2017- he instead required Tommy John surgery in February and missed the season- then began 2018 on the 60-day disabled list.  There is a bit of an unknown in terms of what Reyes will look like upon his return- but assuming good health- he should bring one of the most electric fastballs among all pitching prospects back to the mound. He was easily hitting triple digits before the elbow injury and sat in the mid-to-upper 90s with ease. That and a plus upper-70s curve would be enough for a bullpen gig- but his 88-90 mph changeup gives him a third above-average offering. The only negative for Reyes has been his command- and he will have to keep his walk rate relatively in check to reach his potential as a top-of-the-rotation starter.    Reports of Reyes rehabbing post-surgery were very positive- including the right-hander getting in much better shape. That should help him return to form and start getting back to reaching that extremely high ceiling.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_2KQ7Utxy4?autoplay=1,,|,985,75,175,|,STL,stl,STL,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,Dec. 3- 2012 - STL,|,,,,,|,COL,0.650,2nd,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,55,55,40,,,,40,70,60,70,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,75,55,60,,,,,45

Signed for $1.5 million as the 33rd overall choice in the 2014 Draft- he missed time in his first two full pro seasons when he got suspended for 50 games after testing positive for a banned stimulant (2015) and when he broke his pitching hand in a Spring Training fight with a teammate (2016). He nearly matched his previous career total with 134 1/3 innings last season- when he led the Double-A Southern League in strikeout rate (11.7 per nine innings) and opponent average (.184).  Kopech throws as hard and is as difficult to hit as any starter in the Minor Leagues- which has prompted comparisons to Noah Syndergaard. His fastball- which sits at 96-99 mph- repeatedly hits triple digits with late run that keeps it off barrels. Hitters who try to sit on his heater get embarrassed by his upper-80s slider- which features two-plane break and is a plus-plus offering at its best.  Kopech just needs some refinement before he's ready to pitch at the front of a big league rotation. He'll flash a plus changeup with sink- though it's inconsistent and often more of a fringy offering. He walked 4.5 batters per nine innings through his first four years as a pro- though he's often able to power his way out of self-created jams and cut his walk rate to 2.8 in the second half of 2017.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JXUYoulUEo8?autoplay=1,,|,822,75,205,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,1st rd 2014,Mt.

Honeywell reached Double-A for the first time in his second full season and then returned there to begin 2017 before advancing to Triple-A in mid-April and ultimately helping Durham win the Governor's Cup. Along the way- Honeywell was named the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game Most Valuable Player as the U.S. Team's starting pitcher- furthering his reputation as a confident- big-game hurler. However- Honeywell will now be sidelined until 2019 after he suffered a right elbow injury in February '18 that required Tommy John surgery.   Honeywell has no shortage of weapons at his disposal- as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low to mid-90s- at times touching 95-96 mph- with late sinking action and backs it with a host of secondary offerings- including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch- while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering.  Throwing strikes has never been a problem for Honeywell. His natural athleticism- smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently- and club officials note that his command has improved as he's climbed the Minor League ladder. Honeywell is also a fearless competitor on the mound- and he receives raves for his ability to mix pitches- set up hitters and execute a game plan.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JC3Vetq_eAA?autoplay=1,,|,1462,74,180,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,2nd rd 2014,Walters State JC (TN),,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,60,50,,45,55,,50,60,65,55,,50,55,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,60,45,55,,,65,60

Since signing for a franchise-record $5.5 million- he has produced everywhere he has gone and improved each year. He batted .336/.373/.567 with 18 homers in 89 games between high Class A and Double-A and also turned in a nifty defensive play in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in 2017- when his only setbacks were hand and quad injuries that sidelined him for a combined six weeks.  Rodgers offers more upside at the plate than most middle infielders- possessing all the tools to hit for average and power. He has a quick right-handed swing- good feel for the barrel- fine pitch-recognition skills and plenty of strength. He makes consistent hard contact- and the only quibbles with his offensive game are that he rarely walks and occasionally gets pull-conscious.  When Rodgers was in high school- scouts debated whether he was a long-term shortstop. The consensus now is that while he doesn't have the quickness and range teams typically desire there- his arm strength and instincts allow him to get the job done at short. He could be a solid defender at second or third base- though Nolan Arenado blocks him at the hot corner in Colorado.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/8R3NqST3CPs?autoplay=1,,|,1256,72,180,|,COL,col,COL,,,1st rd 2015,Lake Mary HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,60,50,40,55,50,55,60,45,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,50,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 70 | Field: 45 | Overall: 60  Originally signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2012- Mejia made headlines four years later when he authored a 50-game hitting streak- the longest in the Minor Leagues since 1963- spanning parts of four months and two levels. The breakout performance earned Mejia a selection as the World team's starting catcher in the 2016 SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game- and he went on to finish sixth in the Minors with a .342 average. Mejia only built on that success in 2017- as he was named Eastern League Rookie of the Year- received his first taste of the Majors at age 21 in September and then had a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League while learning a new position.   The switch-hitting Mejia has natural hitting ability from both sides of the plate. Though his approach is aggressive- Mejia generates consistently hard contact to all fields thanks to his advanced bat-to-ball skills and outstanding barrel control. His physical strength and bat speed generates sneaky raw power- especially from the left side- and he's tapped into it more regularly as he's climbed the ladder.   After catching almost exclusively during his first four seasons- Mejia spent the entire AFL working at third base- where he compensated for raw footwork and actions with his cannon- plus-plus arm strength. While the Indians haven't yet given up on Mejia as a catcher- it's clear that they are eager to improve his defensive versatility- with the ultimate goal of getting his bat into the lineup regularly in 2018.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/zjm3SlBQSVM?autoplay=1,,|,771,70,180,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,July 7- 2012 - CLE,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,50,30,55,50,40,80,60,50,55,45,45,80,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,40,70,45,|,,,,,,,,

As a result- many scouts viewed Gore as the top prospect in his class- and the Padres were ecstatic to land the southpaw for $6.7 million after selecting him with the No. 3 overall pick. He rewarded them immediately- turning in a stellar professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League.   An uptick in velocity during Gore's senior year carried over into his pro debut- where he impressed evaluators with his feel for commanding a 92-95 mph fastball. His mid-70s curveball is a true plus pitch and nets him plenty of whiffs- while his low-80s hard slider and tumbling changeup could also grade as plus offerings at their best. Meanwhile- Gore's entire arsenal plays up due to his big- athletic leg kick and because he gets good extension toward the plate- both of which help create a deceptive look for hitters on both sides of the plate.  Padres officials are quick to praise Gore's competitiveness and overall aptitude on the mound- believing that those qualities- along with his potential for four above-average-or-better offerings- could make the young lefty a future front-of-the-rotation piece. Already on his way toward achieving that projection- Gore stands to rise quickly through the Minors compared to his Draft-class peers.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JLkZukR_QSI?autoplay=1,,|,2079,75,191,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,1st rd 2017,Whiteville HS (NC),,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,45,,,,45,55,60,55,50,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,65,55,60,55,,,,55

The Reds allowed him to DH during his pro debut as he readied himself on the mound. After pitching briefly in the Rookie-level Pioneer League- Greene is now a full-time pitcher.  Putting all of his focus on the mound will increase the chances of Greene reaching his incredibly high ceiling. The 6-foot-4 teenager has incredibly easy velocity- cranking his fastball up to triple digits without too much effort. He'll consistently reach 97-101 mph with a clean and repeatable delivery and he commands the pitch fairly well. He shows glimpses of a plus slider- something that should become more consistent as he focuses on one breaking ball. He's shown a good feel for a changeup and while he didn't throw it much in high school- it could eventually be a third at least above-average offering.   The athleticism Greene showed as a shortstop will only help him on the mound in terms of fielding his position and repeating his mechanics. It may take a while for him to refine his secondary stuff- but since he'll be just 18 for most of the 2018 season- there's no reason for the Reds to push him too fast.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/tKAAzmpe180?autoplay=1,,|,2076,76,215,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,1st rd 2017,Notre Dame HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,40,40,50,,,,40,80,60,45,55,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,80,50,,55,,,,55

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Curveball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 60    Buehler began 2015 as MLB Pipeline's No. 4 Draft prospect but injured his elbow before Vanderbilt's season started- never looked completely healthy and slid to the Dodgers at No. 24. He had Tommy John surgery a month after signing for a below-slot $1-777-500 and pitched just five pro innings when he returned to the mound in 2016. Then he took off last year- rocketing from high Class A to Los Angeles while making a case that he's the best pitching prospect in baseball.    After impressing with solid stuff and advanced pitchability while in college at Vanderbilt- Buehler has turned into a power pitcher since having his elbow reconstructed. His fastball has jumped from 90-96 mph before surgery to 95-100 since- usually sitting in the upper 90s. He also has added velocity to his nasty curveball and plus slider- both of which miss bats- and he can turn the latter pitch into a cutter when desired.    Buehler's changeup shows some signs of becoming a solid fourth pitch- though it lacks consistency. His control wasn't as sharp in 2017 as it had been in the past- and he got knocked around by more advanced hitters when he couldn't harness his improved arsenal. His athleticism and ability to repeat his delivery bode well for him regaining his past strike-throwing skills and developing into a frontline starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VnQHWGCjfxM?autoplay=1,,|,1169,74,175,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,1st rd 2015,Vanderbilt,,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,45,55,55,,,,45,70,50,60,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,50,65,60,,,,55

Full Report:  Mize was a semi-sought-after high schooler but ended up at Auburn- where he broke out on the Cape after his freshman year. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate Team USA- then took a giant leap forward this year- as a junior- when his command improved and because he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch. While he threw a sinker most of 2017- Mize now throws a flat four-seamer- up to 97 mph in most starts- but he doesn't throw it much compared to big league norms. In starts we've charted- Mize threw 37% fastballs- 32% cutters- 16% splitters and 15% sliders. Mize is unique- a nearly finished product who could probably pitch in the upper levels of the minors now- and maybe be in a rotation next year- pitching in a way that's becoming more common in the big leagues. On the down side- Mize has some head violence at release and no physical projection and also relies heavily on a new pitch (the cutter) where there's lots of anecdotal evidence that says it dimishes velocity when used often.Discussions of Mize's presumptive selection at #1 overall are always qualified by assumptive health. Mize had shoulder issues in high school that scared some teams off- he missed two starts as a sophomore with forearm tightness and experienced more forearm issues last summer with Team USA- then had non-surgical treatment on the arm in August of last year. He's still our top prospect- but by a smaller margin that some may expect- because he's a risky subset of pitcher. He's also very advanced and should move quickly- and this class lacks a standout- consensus bat to stick ahead of him. The Tigers have been zeroed in on Mize most of the spring and he's the overwhelming favorite to go 1-1.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Splitter: 70 | Control: 60 | Overall: 60  Raw and undrafted out of an Alabama high school three years ago- Mize has blossomed at Auburn and not only is a lock to join Gregg Olson (1988) and Frank Thomas (1989) as Tigers selected in the top 10 picks- but he's also the prohibitive favorite to go No. 1 overall. He has the best combination of stuff and control among college pitchers in the 2018 Draft- and he has proven he can stay healthy. Shut down last spring at Auburn and again during the summer with Team USA with a tired arm and a flexor strain in his forearm- he has had no issues this year.  Mize can get swings and misses with three different pitches- the best of which is a mid-80s splitter that dives at the plate. He sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider has taken a step forward this spring- consistently grading as a plus offering- and he also has developed the ability to turn it into a harder cutter when he desires.Mize has an athletic frame and a clean delivery- so there's no glaring flaw that can be blamed for his health concerns. He pounds the strike zone- ranking first in NCAA Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posting similar numbers as a junior. Scouts also love the way he competes on the mound.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/KTLpXoKizJU?autoplay=1,|,2385,75,208,|,,,,DET,1,,,,|,Auburn,,Auburn,Junior,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,,,60,,70,,60

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  During his time with the Mariners after signing out of Brazil for $800-000 in 2012- Gohara had shown glimpses of his tremendous potential- with about as electric raw stuff as any left-handed prospect in the game- albeit without consistency. After he started to put it together more in 2016- capping it off with a strong Arizona Fall League stint- the Braves acquired him in January and watched Gohara pitch across three levels of the Minors and up to the big leagues in 2017. Gohara began the year on the 10-day disabled list with a left ankle injury.  Gohara was one of the hardest-throwing -- if not the hardest-throwing -- lefties in baseball in 2017. He flirted with triple digits regularly while consistently sitting 96-98 mph. He continued to improve his slider- giving him a second plus pitch he can use to elicit swings and misses. His changeup has also improved- though he tends to throw it too hard and is still developing. Gohara will never be a pinpoint command pitcher- but his control has gotten better as he has both physically and emotionally matured.  He'll have to always keep an eye on his conditioning- but he is definitely going to be a bigger-bodied pitcher- like a David Wells type in that regard. His improvements across the board point to a long-term future as a starter- one he should start fulfilling in the very near future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/aIq9ta-DzXQ?autoplay=1,,|,80,75,265,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,J2 2012,Brazil,Aug. 14- 2012 - SEA,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,,55,,,,45,60,50,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,45,,60,,,,50

He has elite bat control- speed and feel- but is small- which some teams don't like and others don't care about as much.    Full Report:  Madrigal had his share of suitors coming out of a powerhouse NorCal high school- but it's hard for teams to pay a big price for a small- high school second basemen- so he matriculated to Oregon State. He's been electric there for three years- posting big numbers and maturing physically while fine-tuning his game. Madrigal was off to a raucous start in 2018 before fracturing his wrist in a benign-looking homeplate collision- scaring some teams that are worried about durability due to his small frame. He missed about two months- but still hit .395/.460/.560 over the course of the year while playing elite defense at second base- especially around the bag. Madrigal is a complete- do-everything player once you look past his size and could be in the big leagues as soon as 2019 because of how polished his skillset is. He likely goes 4th to the White Sox or 5th to the Reds.,Scouting grades: Hit: 65 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  In the not-too-distant past- a player like Madrigal would have been overlooked by many teams because of his size. The combination of more organizations embracing analytics and the success of players like Jose Altuve- not to mention the superb performance of the 5-foot-7 infielder- had Madrigal poised to perhaps be the top college position player taken in the 2018 Draft. A broken wrist at the start of the season slowed him down- but he returned in April swinging a hot bat.    While Madrigal might have been more of a gut feel kind of player for scouts- he now has track record on top of being a scout favorite. Analytics departments love him because of his approach at the plate that led to more walks than strikeouts in 2017- and while he doesn't have a ton of over-the-fence power- he makes consistent hard contact and is a legitimate extra-base threat. His speed and instincts should allow him to continue to be a base stealer.    While Madrigal has played mostly second base in deference to Cadyn Grenier at Oregon State- some feel he could handle shortstop if need be. If not- he has the chance to be a Gold Glove caliber second baseman in the future. Even with the injury- he should land squarely in the top 10 in June.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/tQxQekapA8k?autoplay=1,|,1394,67,160,|,,,,CHW,4,,,,|,Oregon State,,Oregon State,Junior,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,65,40,60,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

He was an All-Star once again in 2017- this time in the Triple-A International League- as he overcame a slow start to have a torrid second half and help lead Durham to the Governor's Cup.   Adames has hit at every stop in his career despite being a younger player in each league- showing a combination of plus bat speed and barrel control that consistently produces hard- line-drive contact from line to line. Adames' approach is similarly advanced- as his knowledge of the strike zone and knack for working deep counts nets him plenty of walks and fuels his on-base skills. His power has come along as he's climbed the ladder- resulting in at least 10 home runs and 30 doubles in back-to-back seasons- and scouts expect he'll offer at least average power at maturity. Defensively- Adames compensates for his average speed with excellent instincts and quick feet at shortstop- where he profiles as a plus defender with soft hands- smooth footwork and plus arm strength.  Adames has long received praise from club officials for his plus makeup and leadership skills- both on and off the field. He has all the ingredients to develop into an All-Star-caliber shortstop capable of hitting in the middle of a lineup and could soon be ready for his first taste of the Majors.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/b0XEzkgl-EQ?autoplay=1,,|,992,72,200,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2012 - DET,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,45,45,55,45,45,60,55,55,55,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

Though little was known about him at the time- Baez put himself on the radar during his dominant stateside debut- showing a combination of physicality and stuff that enabled him to quickly jump to Class A Fort Wayne after just one start in the Rookie Arizona League.  A physically large and imposing presence on the mound who operates from a three-quarters slot- Baez generates easy plus-plus velocity in a fastball that bumps 98-99 mph and consistently sits in the mid-90s. His heater pairs nicely with an upper-80s slider that flashes above-average potential with two-plane action- and club officials expect both his curveball and changeup to be at least average once fully developed.   Though listed at 6-foot-8 and 220 pounds- Baez showed in 2017 that he could repeat his delivery and pound the strike zone better than most hurlers of comparable size. His command does lag behind his control- however- and he'll need to locate his fastball better to be effective at higher levels.

He went 11-3 with a 2.56 ERA and a school-record 146 strikeouts in 16 starts on the mound as a junior while also hitting .341 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs to win the Golden Spikes and Dick Howser Awards as college baseball's top player. Drafted fourth overall by Tampa Bay in June- McKay received the second-highest signing bonus ($7-007-500) under the current set of Draft rules- and then continued his two-way career during an impressive pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League.   McKay operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that he commands well against hitters on both sides of the plate- though his velocity is prone to dipping as he works deeper into games. Both his curveball and cutter project to be above-average pitches- and he showed good feel for a changeup during his pro debut after using it sparingly at Louisville.   At the plate- McKay's smooth left-handed swing and mature all-fields approach led some evaluators to label him the best college bat in his class as a potential .300 hitter capable of hitting 20 homers per season. His lack of speed limits him to first base- but he proved a sound defender during his pro debut- and could become above average in time.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/eml6BjjTDJg?autoplay=1,,|,2077,74,212,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,1st rd 2017,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,55,,,,,40,55,55,60,,,,,50,|,60,50,30,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

He signed for $6.725 million- $1 million under pick value- then repaid Minnesota's faith in him by performing extremely well in the Gulf Coast League and all the way up in the full-season Midwest League after a late promotion.  Lewis has outstanding athleticism on both sides of the ball. When you combine that with his baseball IQ- it's easy to see a future star. At the plate- he barrels the ball up consistently and has extra-base authority to all fields- with more power to come for sure. He showed an advanced approach at the plate with the ability to draw walks- which should give him more opportunities to use his plus speed on the basepaths. There were some questions about whether Lewis would be a shortstop long term- or need to move to center- but he has good range and hands and might have just enough arm to stay on the dirt. The Twins plan to keep him there- at least for the time being.  Lewis will be an impact up-the-middle player in either case. After his strong pro debut that saw the prepster jump on a slightly faster track by getting his feet wet in Cedar Rapids- watching his full-season encore should be a treat.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/IRGoLxDpn0U?autoplay=1,,|,2080,74,188,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,1st rd 2017,JSerra HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,30,25,50,60,45,55,55,50,55,60,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,70,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA late 2018.,Scouting Grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 60 | Overall: 55  The Braves are not afraid to push young pitchers quickly through their system. Though high school pitchers from Canada would seem to need extra development time on the surface- Soroka's feel for pitching allowed him to embrace the challenges. The right-hander helped Rome win the South Atlantic League title in 2016- and then he finished second in the Double-A Southern League in ERA as a followup.  While he might not have the pure stuff to match some of the other promising arms in the Braves system- Soroka's pitchability combined with his stuff gives him exciting potential. He throws his fastball in the 92-95 mph range- sitting 93-94 mph- and he does so with heavy sink that produces ground-ball outs. His breaking ball has really improved to complement the sinker and he changes the shape and depth to it- with it coming as an upper-80s slider at times and a mid-80s power curve at others. He has feel for a changeup as well- and he can throw any of his pitches for strikes at any point in the count.  Soroka is ready to knock on the big league door while spending nearly all of the 2018 season at age 20. His size- mound presence- feel for the strike zone and stuff might give him the highest floor of any pitching prospect in the system- with a long career as a No. 3 type innings-eater awaiting.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LozVLyAQ3qs?autoplay=1,,|,1289,77,225,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2015,Bishop Carroll HS (CAN),,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,,55,,,,45,55,55,,55,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,55,,55,,,,60

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Barreto was fresh off his impressive pro debut when the Blue Jays sent him and three other prospects to the A's for Josh Donaldson in November 2014. He's since blossomed in Oakland's system- as Barreto made the jump straight to the California League the next year before finishing sixth in the Texas League batting race (.281) in 2016. That offensive success would follow Barreto to Triple-A in 2017- although he struggled mightily at the plate overall during two stints in the Majors after homering in his big league debut.  Barreto's potent bat is his calling card- as he's long showed the potential to hit for both average and power. His quick right-handed bat and feel for the barrel yields hard- line-drive contact across the entire field- and he's started to tap into more game power as he's climbed the ladder. His propensity to swing-and-miss stems from an aggressive approach and below-average pitch recognition- both of which he'll need to refine in order to adjust to big league pitching. Barreto has slightly above-average speed and likes to run- though he still has many gains to make as a basestealer.  A fringy defender at shortstop where he shows a plus arm but inconsistent hands and actions- Barreto is a better long-term fit at second base- where he has a chance to become an average defender. Regardless of his ultimate position- Barreto will need to become a more selective hitter to carve out an everyday role in the Majors.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/KuHQqKfcO_I?autoplay=1,,|,208,70,190,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,J2 2012,Venezuela,July 2- 2012 - TOR,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,50,45,60,60,40,60,55,55,60,60,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,55,60,45,|,,,,,,,,

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 65 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  Viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick for the 2016 Draft after a dominant sophomore season at Florida- Puk was plagued by back spasms and didn't show the same consistency as a junior. He still ended up going sixth overall to the A's and signed for $4-069-200- the largest bonus for a pitcher in franchise history. Puk lived up to the hype in his first full season- as the left-hander garnered California League All-Star honors before advancing to Double-A in June and then appearing in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game the following month. However- his progress has been delayed by Tommy John surgery that will require him to miss all of 2018.   Puk has elite bat-missing ability- a notion supported by his Minor League-leading 13.2 strikeouts-per-nine in 2017. He induces many of those whiffs with his plus fastball-slider pairing- as he'll operate at 93-97 mph with his heater to set up a devastating mid- to upper-80s slider. Puk also features a curveball and changeup- both of which improved as the season progressed. What's more- Puk's entire arsenal plays up because he gets tremendous extension from his 6-foot-7 frame.  Puk made strides as a strike-thrower in his first full season after making an adjustment to his delivery early in the year. His control and command should continue to improve as he learns to control his long levers and repeat his delivery with greater consistency. With further gains on that front- and the development of a more effective changeup to use against right-handed hitters- Puk could achieve his ceiling of a No. 2 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/dF78XZniyhY?autoplay=1,,|,343,79,220,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,1st rd 2016,Florida,,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,55,60,,,,45,65,60,60,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,50,45,65,,,,45

He made an immediate impact by reaching full-season Class A during his pro debut- and then emerged as one of the Minor Leagues' top breakout hurlers in 2017- much of which he spent in Double-A. Burnes ultimately finished second in the Minors with a 1.67 ERA- netting him honors as Milwaukee's MiLB pitcher of the year.   Scouts rave about Burnes' lightning-quick arm- as it produces a 92-95 mph fastball that has natural cutting action out of his hand. He pounds the strike zone with the pitch- using it to attack hitters on both sides of the plate- and maintains velocity deep into starts. Burnes' above-average curveball- thrown with a high spin rate and late- downer action- is his best secondary offering- and he also shows advanced feel for a mid-80s slider. An effective changeup that has splitter-like action in the mid- to upper-80s rounds out Burnes' four-pitch mix- all of which play up due to his above-average control.   Burnes' rapid ascent through Milwaukee's system speaks both to his overall ability as well as his capacity to make key adjustments. An improved- more efficient delivery has helped assuage concerns about the righty's durability- leaving little doubt about his ability to stick as a big league starter. If all goes as planned with his development- Burnes could take a similar path to the Majors as Brandon Woodruff did in 2017.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/2hV-kZ5zxdk?autoplay=1,,|,1644,75,205,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,4th rd 2016,St. Mary's,,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,50,50,,,,50,55,50,55,55,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,55,,,,60

Although a right elbow injury limited him to designated hitter duties and portended eventual surgery- the Brewers- undeterred by Hiura's injury- were thrilled to add him to their system- signing Hiura for below slot value at $4 million. He immediately rewarded his new club with an outstanding pro debut- highlighted by an impressive performance after a promotion to Class A Wisconsin- and then returned to the field in earnest during instructional league.   Hiura has a short- impactful right-handed stroke with a ton of bat speed and outstanding feel for the barrel. He projects to hit for a high average and shows at least average in-game power- with the ball coming off of his bat differently than most to all fields. Though not a basestealing threat- Hiura does possess average speed and earns high marks for his baserunning and awareness.   A post-Draft MRI led the Brewers to believe that Hiura could make a successful recovery without needing surgery. He did just that- completing a throwing program in Rookie ball before appearing in games at second base without issue during instructs. He's a passable defender at the keystone- where he has decent actions and footwork- though some believe he's ultimately destined for left field. Regardless of his future defensive home- Hiura's potent bat is his calling card to a lengthy career in the Majors.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/wgVOB9lK0Z8?autoplay=1,,|,2014,71,190,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,1st rd 2017,UC Irvine,,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,40,40,55,50,40,40,60,55,55,50,50,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,65,50,50,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  The Indians parted with two former first-rounders- Clint Frazier (No. 5 overall in 2013) and Sheffield (No. 31 in 2014)- as part of a four-prospect package to get Andrew Miller from the Yankees in July 2016. The only detour in Sheffield's steady development path came when he missed most of the final two months of last season with a strained oblique- though afterward he was one of the best pitchers in the Arizona Fall League. His older brother Jordan- a right-hander- was a 2016 supplemental first-round choice by the Dodgers.   Sheffield could have three plus pitches when all is said and done. His 92-97 mph fastball features some run and sink and is his most consistent offering- though his mid-80s slider may have more upside. His changeup isn't as reliable as his first two options- yet he still shows the ability to miss bats with it.  Though Sheffield is a little shorter than desired for a starter at 5-foot-11- he still creates downhill plane with his delivery and doesn't throw with excessive effort. He's athletic and has been durable as a pro outside of his oblique injury.

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 70 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 60 | Overall: 55  Signed out of the Mexican League in December 2013- Urias has since developed into one of the more accomplished hitters in the Minor Leagues. The California League's youngest everyday player on Opening Day in 2016- Urias went on to win the circuit's batting title and MVP award at age 19- and then garnered Double-A Texas League All-Star honors in 2017 before a standout turn in the prestigious Arizona Fall League.   Urias stands out as much for his approach and plate discipline as he does for his pure hitting ability. He has an advanced knowledge of the strike zone as well as excellent pitch recognition- a combination that netted him the Texas League's top on-base percentage (.398) in 2017- and has resulted in more walks (153) than strikeouts (135) in four professional seasons. Urias' bat-to-ball skills are impressive- and he produces hard line drives across the entire field with a compact- level swing. His raw power- meanwhile- is better than his numbers suggest- though Urias' should be a consistent source of extra-base hits thanks to his knack for pounding the gaps. Urias has solid arm strength and can get the job done at shortstop- but he offers more upside at second base- where he's a plus defender and has spent the bulk of his pro career.  Urias proved plenty capable at shortstop in 2017- first in Double-A and then in the Arizona Fall League- and should continue to see some time there moving forward. His ultimate defensive home- however- is likely second base- where he profiles as an above-average defender with good range and arm strength.

Instead- Wright went No. 5 overall to the Braves and he signed for an above-pick value of $7 million. The eighth Vanderbilt pitcher taken in the first round in the past 10 Drafts- Wright pitched sparingly during his pro debut following a long college season- though he competed well in a brief taste of the Class A Advanced Florida State League.  Wright has four pitches- all of which will flash at least better than average- with the ability to throw all of them for strikes. He throws his plus fastball in the 94-98 mph range and can comfortably sit around 95-96 mph- maintaining his velocity deep into starts. He has two distinct breaking balls- with his hard curve a plus pitch that is just a touch ahead of a power slider. His changeup might be a touch behind the other three- but it's a usable weapon and he will throw it at times with above-average deception and movement.   While Wright struggled a little with command during his junior year- he is physical and athletic enough to repeat his delivery and throw more than enough strikes.

Though he would ultimately sign for $750-000- Alford   spent most of 2012-14 on the gridiron- eventually transferring to Mississippi as a defensive back before deciding to play baseball full-time. Despite his time off- Alford excelled in his first full season- though two separate trips to the disabled list for a knee injury and a concussion- respectively- hindered his progress in 2016. After a strong start to his 2017 campaign with Double-A New Hampshire- Alford was called up for his big league debut in May- only to suffer a broken hamate bone and land on the disabled list for two months. The injury bug struck Alford again in Spring Training- with a Grade 2 hamstring strain delaying his start to the 2018 season.  Alford generates good bat speed and makes a lot of hard contact from the right side of the plate. His mature approach and solid pitch recognition translate to plenty of walks and strong on-base skills that fuel his potential as a true top-of-the-order hitter. He has the strength and swing plane to drive the ball out of the park- shows good raw power to center field and could clear more fences as he continues to refine his approach. Alford's knee injury diminished his speed last season- but he's still a plus- if not better runner capable of impacting games on the bases as well as in center field- where he has plus range but a below-average arm.  Alford didn't receive another crack at the Majors in September because the Blue Jays felt it was more important for him to receive guaranteed at-bats in Triple-A while making up for lost time. Meanwhile- Alford's transformation from a raw athlete into a well-rounded and polished ballplayer in a short amount of time understandably has club officials excited about his bright future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/lU6bw7GGXcs?autoplay=1,,|,198,73,215,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,3rd rd 2012,Petal HS (MS),,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,35,40,60,70,50,40,45,50,60,70,60,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,70,45,60,|,,,,,,,,

High- striking out 157 batters in 91 innings- but concerns regarding how much he would develop physically caused him to fall into the supplemental first round- where the Indians drafted him and then gave him the largest bonus ($2-302-500) for a high school pitcher in the 2015 Draft. McKenzie's prospect stock took flight in 2016 as he earned All-Star honors in the New York-Penn League before advancing to full-season ball at age 18. Spending all of 2017 with Class A Advanced Lynchburg- McKenzie paced the Carolina League in strikeouts (186) and finished second among qualified pitchers in WHIP (1.05)- earning a trip to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game along the way. The right-hander began the season on Lynchburg's disabled list as a precautionary move after he experienced forearm soreness during spring camp.  McKenzie stands out for his present blend of pitchability and physical projection. His velocity has improved some as he's begun to grow into his wiry athletic frame- and it's easy to envision him adding a few more ticks with further physical development. He has a feel for locating his low-90s fastball throughout the zone- all while using his height to create good angle toward the plate. McKenzie's curveball- thrown with tight spin and loads of depth- flashes plus and nets him plenty of whiffs- and he shows a similarly advanced feel for throwing an above-average- fading changeup. Above-average control and overall efficiency enable his entire arsenal to play up.  McKenzie was one of the youngest players in his Draft class- but he's quickly proved more advanced than most of his peers while making a quick climb through Cleveland's system. Adding more strength should help assuage concerns about McKenzie's long-term durability- but all the ingredients are present for the right-hander to develop into a No. 2 or 3 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/SaiUEE5AOzQ?autoplay=1,,|,1197,77,165,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,1st rd 2015,Royal Palm Beach HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,55,,,,,50,60,45,60,,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,60,55,60,,,,,55

The Indians made the right-hander their fourth-round pick in June 2016- and Bieber quickly rewarded them with a strong pro debut. Bieber's first full season- meanwhile- was nothing short of remarkable- as he led the organization in innings pitched (173 1/3)- ranked second in ERA (2.86) and demonstrated superb command while pitching at three levels- including Double-A.   The average velocity Bieber showed as an amateur ticked up in his first full season- as he sat comfortably in the 91-94 mph range with his heater while occasionally reaching back for a few extra ticks. Bieber also has made strides in developing his curveball- now an above-average pitch- and he continues to show advanced feel for a slider and a changeup that both grade as average.  Bieber's greatest strength is his ability to command the baseball- and there might not be anyone in the Minors better at it than him. Issuing just 10 walks in 2017- he led all Minor League hurlers both in walk rate (1.5 percent) and walks-per-nine innings (0.5 BB/9)- and did so while generating a healthy amount of whiffs. While it's yet to be seen how his bat-missing ability might translate at higher levels- Bieber- with his combination of polish- pitchability and durability- shows all the components needed to become a No. 4 starter.,,,,,|,1677,75,195,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,4th rd 2016,UC Santa Barbara,,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,55,45,,,,55,50,50,60,50,,,,70,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,50,,,,70

Full Report:  Swaggerty was a new name to most scouts last summer when he starred as the sparkplug for collegiate Team USA- playing center field and batting atop the lineup along with Madrigal. Swaggerty showed bat control and gap power- and was a fringe first rounder for many off that first- extended look- but he came out this spring looking like a different player. He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength- lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power- arm strength and speed. Swaggerty didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference and who had a summer of good performance with wood bats against strong competition- because Swaggerty's new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times- causing him to lose balance andbe in a poor position to hit. He was hot fearly in the year- then had another hot streak in April- but some high level evaluators (and us) saw him multiple times only during intermittent slumps- which could make it tough for teams to pick him early when the stats and your eyes both say that hit tool is questionablel. We think at least average offense is in there- Swaggerty just needs to dial in the swing mechanics and an approach that takes best advantage of his tools- which are arguably tops in the class. Swaggerty seemed like a likely top-5 overall pick but it sounds like he may slide out of the top 6 due to some uneven late season games.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  South Alabama has sent two dozen players to the big leagues in the Draft era but has never had a first-round pick- a void that Swaggerty will fill in June as one of the first college position players selected. Undrafted and lightly regarded as a Louisiana high schooler- he reached double figures in homers and steals as a sophomore in 2016. He also impressed with Team USA last summer- with some scouts considering him the best position prospect on the squad- and continued to show all-around tools this spring.Swaggerty is an on-base machine thanks to his speed (which earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators) and patient approach. A left-handed hitter- he does swing and miss a bit much for a player with a leadoff profile because he can get overly aggressive at times- especially against breaking pitches. Though he didn't go deep in 64 at-bats with wood bats on Team USA- he packs some sneaky power in his athletic frame and could produce 20 or more homers per season in the big leagues.  Swaggerty also uses his quickness well to steal bases and track down balls in center field. He throws better than most players at his position -- his fastball reached 92 mph when he was a high school pitcher -- and his makeup is another positive in his favor. The most common comparison is Brett Gardner- though Gardner had less pop and more speed at the same stage of his career.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/qTYA7IA0cCQ?autoplay=1,|,2391,71,180,|,,,,PIT,10,,,,|,South Alabama,,South Alabama,Junior,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,60,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

Spencer made his big league debut late in '16- the same year Washington took Carter- the youngest of three baseball-playing brothers- with its first of back-to-back picks late in the first round. Regarded by scouts as one of the best prep hitters in his class- Carter signed for below slot at $2 million and then flashed his offensive potential in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Assigned to Class A Hagerstown for his first full season- Kieboom got off to a torrid start by hitting for average and power in the South Atlantic League- only to suffer a hamstring injury and land on the disabled list roughly a month into his campaign.  Kieboom has a knack for barreling the baseball- a product of his plus bat speed- hand-eye coordination and mature approach. He was aggressive to a fault at times and showed some swing-and-miss tendencies during his pro debut- though his approach appeared more refined in 2017- leading scouts to project him as a future above-average hitter. Kieboom gets good loft to his right-handed swing- too- so much so that he should have at least average power once he fills out physically.   Kieboom's average speed plays up thanks to his quick feet and excellent instincts. Those tools- along with his solid range and above-average arm strength- give him a chance to stick at shortstop- although some believe he'll eventually end up at third base. Regardless of his ultimate defensive home- it will be Kieboom's bat that gets him to the big leagues.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIz5j-OJPrY?autoplay=1,,|,1725,74,190,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,1st rd 2016,Walton HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,55,50,45,55,55,55,60,45,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2020.,Scouting Grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  The Braves continued their hoarding of high school arms when they selected Anderson from the Upstate New York high school ranks with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2016 Draft. As they have with previous prep arms- the Braves sent Anderson to full-season Rome for his first full professional year- and he was up for the challenge- pitching extremely well while under fairly tight usage restrictions.  Anderson already shows the makings of three pitches that have the chance to be above-average to plus- along with a willingness to work tirelessly on his craft. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-96 mph range and will sit consistently around 93-94 mph. Tall and projectable- he throws with excellent downhill angle- showing the ability to both miss bats and generate weak contact on the ground. He gets swings and misses with a curve that can be plus at times. Anderson's greatest leap forward came with his changeup. He worked hard on the offspeed pitch last offseason and it showed- as it was a plus pitch for him on occasion. While his walk rate was high during his first full season- there aren't overarching concerns about his command.  The gloves could come off a bit for Anderson in 2018- though with the depth in the system- there's no reason to rush him. There's still plenty of upside for Anderson to reach and he eventually could develop into a front-half-of-the-rotation kind of starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/HxXHHVrAXyQ?autoplay=1,,|,1708,75,170,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2016,Shenendowa HS (NY),,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,55,,,,,40,60,55,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,55,55,,,,,50

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 70 | Arm: 60 | Field: 70 | Overall: 50  Signed for $1.4 million back in July 2015- when he was ranked as the No. 14 international prospect by MLB Pipeline- Pache has improved rapidly since signing. He played across two levels of Rookie ball during his professional debut in 2016- then showed it was far from a fluke by earning an All-Star nod as one of the youngest regulars in the full-season South Atlantic League in 2017.    Pache is the best defender in the entire Braves system- and might be the best defensive center fielder in the Minor Leagues. He has plus speed to go along with outstanding instincts and supreme confidence in his ability to track down balls wherever they are hit. He also has a plus arm that allowed him to rack up 17 outfield assists in 2017. Pache's speed also works on the basepaths and he'll become an even better basestealer as he learns his craft. Aggressive at the plate- Pache has hit in the early stages of his career thanks to an ability to make consistent contact. While he has not hit a home run heading into the 2018 season- he has strength and raw power to tap into- with 12-15 homers as a potential ceiling.     Pache loses strength partially because he tends to start running before he finishes his swing. A tireless worker- the teenager has made strides to stay on his legs more- and showed some more ability to drive the ball during instructs- something that could help him become an All-Star-caliber player.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/TTrN1fNVTzI?autoplay=1,,|,1080,74,185,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 3- 2015 - ATL,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,50,80,70,70,55,40,55,80,80,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,70,60,70,|,,,,,,,,

He was a two-way player as a prepster- but was drafted for his pitching prowess in the first round of the 2014 Draft. His stuff took a leap forward in 2017- which helped him pitch across two levels of the Minors- participate in the Futures Game and make his big league debut.    In the early part of his pro career- Flaherty operated with an average fastball in the low 90s- though he did so successfully because of solid command. That upticked in 2017 to 93-95 mph- even touching 96 on occasion. He has two distinct breaking balls- with his slider tightening up more and flashing plus at times and a curve that can be Major League average. He will throw his changeup too hard at times- and it comes in too firmly as a result- but it does flash above-average.    Flaherty has always been a strike-thrower- but his overall command improved as well in 2017 and he missed more bats while keeping hitters from making solid contact consistently. He profiles at least as a mid-rotation workhorse- but given he's just 22 years old- there could be more in the tank to come.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/vSy5LD5ZWXk?autoplay=1,,|,831,76,205,|,STL,stl,STL,,,1st rd 2014,Harvard Westlake HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,55,50,,,,50,55,45,55,55,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,55,55,50,55,,,,60

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  The first of two Braves' first-round picks in 2015- Allard has been pushed fairly aggressively- along with fellow first-rounder Mike Soroka. A teenager in Double-A in 2017- the left-hander finished fifth in the league in strikeouts and eighth in ERA.  The 6-foot-1 southpaw thrives with a three-pitch mix that starts with outstanding fastball command. He throws his heater in the 88-93 mph range- but it plays up because of its movement and because of Allard's ability to move it in and out with ease. That can occasionally get him into trouble- as he falls in love with his fastball command and pitches off of his fastball too much. His changeup- once his third offering- is now a plus pitch and Allard would often fall into a fastball-changeup pattern. That's something that isn't necessary- given he still possesses a plus curve. While his walk rate jumped in 2017- he still is very much a strike-thrower.  As long as Allard continues to mix his pitches well- he has the makings of a solid big league starter. Perhaps he has the ceiling of a No. 3 type starter- but he's pretty close to being ready to reaching it at age 20.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/6j3g65GKpzk?autoplay=1,,|,1263,73,190,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2015,San Clemente HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,50,,,,,50,50,55,55,,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,50,60,55,,,,,55

He defected the following year and ranked No. 2 on MLB Pipeline's list of the Top 30 2016-17 international prospects before signing with the Padres for a franchise-record $11 million the day after he was declared a free agent. The precocious lefty lived up to his price tag during his 2017 stateside debut- finishing the season as a member of Class A Fort Wayne's starting rotation.   Morejon impresses with a combination of stuff and polish that belies his age. He's physically strong- with an athletic and repeatable delivery that gives him present command of a fastball that sits at 91-93 mph and has reached 96. He complements his fastball with both a knuckle-changeup and a standard changeup- both grading as above average- and evaluators expect his curveball to earn a similar grade once he can better repeat his arm slot. Morejon understands sequencing and throws strikes with his entire arsenal- and he should continue to make gains in velocity and command as he matures physically.

A mid-season All-Star in his return to Class A Advanced Tampa in 2017- Mateo reached Double-A Trenton for the first time in June and was hitting .300/.381/.525 when the Yankees dealt him to Oakland as part of the Trade Deadline blockbuster for Sonny Gray. He continued to produce as Double-A Midland's shortstop after the trade and ultimately played a major role in helping the Rockhounds secure their fourth straight Texas League title.   Mateo has a nice all-around set of tools- but it's his elite speed that enables him to truly impact games. He led the Minors with 82 steals in 2015 and tied for third with 52 in '17 to push his career total to 234 stolen bases in his first six pro seasons. Mateo's wheels are equally dynamic out of the box- as he regularly turns in top-of-the-scale run times from home to first. His deceptive strength translates to sneaky raw power and he has an offensive ceiling of a .275 hitter with 15 homers per season- though he'll need to tighten his plate discipline to become a quality leadoff man.  Mateo has the raw tools to stick at shortstop- most notably outstanding range and plus arm strength- though his consistency and focus in the field still leave something to be desired. Some scouts believe he'll wind up at second base or in center field- the latter of which he played for the first time in his career in 2017.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/E87r8QWTQ8c?autoplay=1,,|,982,72,190,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,J2 2011,Dominican Republic,Jan. 28- 2012 - NYY,|,,,,,|,WAS,0.500,1st,|,40,35,50,80,40,55,50,50,55,80,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,80,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

The White Sox considered him with the 26th overall pick before taking Zack Burdi- then acquired him six months later from the Nationals (who signed him for $2 million at No. 29) as part of the Adam Eaton trade. The younger brother of ex-big leaguer Jake Dunning- he posted a 2.94 ERA with a 168/38 K/BB ratio at two Class A stops in his first full pro season.  Dunning's fastball works as a plus pitch- more for its heavy sink than its velocity- which is fine sitting in the low 90s and peaking at 96. He recorded a 1.7 groundout/flyout ratio in his first two years in the Minors- though his home run rate spiked to 1.1 per nine innings in high Class A after he surrendered just one homer in his first 61 2/3 pro innings. His fastball also plays up because of his ability to command it to both sides of the plate.  Dunning's slider with depth and his changeup both have the potential to become at least solid secondary offerings- though they need more consistency. He has an athletic delivery and repeats it fairly well- allowing him to pound the strike zone. The most polished of Chicago's top pitching prospects- he lacks the huge ceiling of Michael Kopech or Alec Hansen but has a higher floor and is a safe bet to become a mid-rotation starter.,,,,,|,1681,76,200,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,1st rd 2016,Florida,,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,,55,,,,45,55,55,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,55,,55,,,,60

The Reds liked his tools on the diamond enough to go way above pick value to give him $3.2 million as the No. 35 overall pick in the 2016 Draft. He rewarded the organization's faith with a very productive first full season in the Midwest League in 2017.  Everyone knew Trammell's athleticism would help make him an exciting prospect- but his feel for the game has exceeded many expectations. While there is some swing and miss he'll continue to work on- Trammell's strikeout rate went down and his walk rate went up in the second half of his first full season. His ability to draw walks allows him to use his speed to be a basestealing threat on a more regular basis. He has shown the ability to drive the ball with extra-base pop- and there should be more over-the-fence power to come as he matures. His speed works well in the outfield and most feel he could stick in center field- though his fringy arm could push him to left down the road.  Wherever he plays defensively- Trammell has the tools to impact the game in a number of ways. The development of his bat and speed as he moves up the ladder will be one of the more exciting Reds prospect storylines to watch in 2018.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/q4xKSJPOmr4?autoplay=1,,|,1720,74,195,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,1st rd 2016,Mount Paran HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,50,70,30,30,55,50,55,70,45,30,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,70,45,55,|,,,,,,,,

He continued to rake and advanced quickly in pro ball- leading the Double-A Texas League in total bases (236) and RBIs (88) in his first full season and slamming 31 homers in Triple-A last year. The best of the three prospects the Rangers received in the Yu Darvish trade in July- he took Justin Verlander deep during his September callup.  Calhoun combines hitting ability and power better than most prospects. He has a quick left-handed stroke and is content to use the middle of the field and let his pop come naturally. He struck out in just 12 percent of his at-bats during his first three years as a pro and could develop into a .300 hitter with 25 homers thanks to the favorable conditions in Texas.  An outfielder and a third baseman at Yavapai- Calhoun spent most of his time in the Dodgers system at second base- but played almost exclusively in left field after changing organizations. His quickness- hands and arm were all liabilities at second base and few scouts thought he could stay in the infield. His range and arm are subpar in left field as well- though his offensive capabilities still allow him to profile well at the less challenging position.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7XMXYBi4g?autoplay=1,,|,1179,68,187,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,4th rd 2015,Yavapai JC (AZ),,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,50,50,65,30,40,45,60,60,65,30,40,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,60,35,45,40,|,,,,,,,,

He took to it quickly- earning $1 million to sign with the Astros in 2014. The best term to describe the young right-hander has been precocious- as he has shown an advanced feel for pitching given his age. He reached Double-A at age 19 in 2017 before being the marquee prospect sent to the Tigers in the Justin Verlander trade at the end of August. Excitement for his Tigers debut in 2018 was dampened by a lat strain that is expected to keep him out for an extended period of time to start the season.    Perez has four pitches at his disposal- all of which he can throw for strikes. He generally throws his lively fastball in the 92-94 mph range- but he can reach back for 95-96 mph when he needs to. Added velocity could come as he matures. He can really spin his curveball- a future plus offering- and he's taken to a relatively new slider as well. He throws his above-average changeup with solid fade. With an athletic and repeatable delivery- he should continue to command the ball well even if he adds velocity.    The Verlander trade happened too late for Perez to make his Tigers debut in 2017- and now the Tigers will have to be more patient in waiting for him to be healthy. He has a relatively high floor as a mid-rotation-type starter and is just 20 years old for all of 2018.,,,,,|,706,75,197,|,DET,det,DET,,,J2 2014,Venezuela,July 2- 2014 - HOU,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,45,,,,45,60,60,55,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,55,60,50,,,,55

The Kentucky high school star was his state's Gatorade Player of the Year and led all high school hitters with 25 home runs. While there was some concern about his ability to hit- the Angels liked the upside enough to take him No. 10 overall and sign him for full pick value. He then went out and showed off all of those tools across two levels of rookie ball during his pro debut.    While no one questions Adell's raw power and bat speed from the right side- some were concerned with his ability to make enough contact to tap into it due to some swing-and-miss tendencies that showed up against top competition on the summer showcase circuit. There were some strikeouts during his debut- but he impressed the Angels with his ability to make adjustments and drive the ball to all fields. A tremendous athlete with plus speed- Adell has the chance to continue to be a basestealing threat long term. It also helps give him plenty of range to patrol center- though he didn't play the outfield last summer because of a minor shoulder issue. His plus arm- which fired upper-90s fastballs from the mound in high school- would also work in right.    Even with the exciting debut- patience will be key in the dynamic outfielder's development. If it all continues to click- he could develop into the kind of All-Star performer teams hope to get with their first-round selections.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/tpQIfgNoqIE?autoplay=1,,|,1928,75,208,|,LAA,laa,ANA,,,1st rd 2017,Ballard HS (KY),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,55,40,30,50,60,70,45,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,65,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

Fields- who had a 6.89 ERA for Houston at the time of the deal- pitched well in the 2016 and 2017 regular seasons for Los Angeles but gave up two runs without recording an out in Game 2 of the World Series last fall- helping turn the Fall Classic in Houston's favor. Meanwhile- Alvarez batted .304/.379/.481 between two Class A stops and played in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in his first full season.  For a 6-foot-5- 225-pounder- Alvarez has a relatively quiet and compact left-handed swing. He demonstrates advanced feel for the barrel and the strike zone- which should allow him to hit for a high average. He also has plenty of bat speed- strength and leverage- which should produce a lot of power as well.  Alvarez also has some surprising athleticism for someone his size. He'll flash above-average speed once he gets going- though it plays more as average and he'll likely lose a step as he matures physically. He has shown more aptitude in left field than at first base and gets the job done on the outfield corner.

The Rangers have chosen to promote him aggressively- making him the youngest regular (age 17) in the Short Season Northwest League during his 2016 debut and the third-youngest (age 18) in the Class A South Atlantic League last season. While he hasn't posted huge numbers (.257/.316/.362)- he also hasn't been overmatched and his tools have been obvious.  Taveras is a switch-hitter with a good swing from both sides of the plate -- the consensus is that he's better as a left-handed hitter -- and he already displays command of the strike zone and the ability to recognize pitches. Add in his plus speed and he should have little difficulty hitting for average. With his easy bat speed and projectable strength- he also could grow into at least average power once he matures physically.  While Tavares still is learning how to translate his quickness into stolen bases- he already uses his speed well in center field. He gets good reads and jumps- allowing him to chase down balls from gap to gap. He also has solid arm strength that fits well at any of the three outfield spots- though he won't have to move from center.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/RpzjuTfUZqg?autoplay=1,,|,1088,73,170,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - TEX,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,30,20,45,60,45,55,55,45,50,60,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,

He asked clubs not to take him because he wanted to attend North Carolina -- the Diamondbacks took a flier on him in the 20th round -- and blossomed into a first-rounder after three years in college. The 2017 Atlantic Coast Conference pitcher of the year- he faltered in the NCAA regional playoffs and slid a bit to the Astros at No. 15- where he signed for $3.6 million.  Some scouts believed that Bukauskas had the best 1-2 combination of pitches in the 2017 Draft. Both his mid-90s fastball with sink and his mid-80s slider are at least plus-plus pitches at their best- though he sometimes falls in love with his slider too much and loses fastball command. He'll flash some solid changeups with some armside run- though he needs to employ the pitch more often so he can refine it.  Bukauskas toned down his delivery in college- but he's still a 6-foot right-hander who throws with considerable effort- so there's a split camp among evaluators as to whether he can remain a starter. Houston believes he can and his proponents think he compares favorably to Sonny Gray. If the Astros decide to move him to the bullpen- he has closer upside and should move rapidly through the Minors.,,,,,|,820,72,196,|,HOU,hou,HOU,,,1st rd 2017,North Carolina,,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,,60,,,,40,60,50,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,50,,65,,,,50

A wide receiver in high school with a father and brother who played in the NFL- Jones has legit athleticism- and he's already learned how to use it consistently on the baseball field. His plus speed is an asset on the basepaths- with basestealing ability. He showed aptitude in center field- but the Angels moved him to second base just prior to the start of the 2018 season- a position he played in high school.

He gets extremely high marks for his work ethic and makeup- both on and off the field.    His intangibles give Jones a very high floor. His tools and athleticism give him a very high ceiling.

Full Report:  Winn transferred to Orange Lutheran from Silvercreek High in Colorado and quickly became this draft's best Southern California prospect. Though his build is somewhat soft and he lacks physical projection- he has the prototypical pitcher's frame- a good delivery and plenty of present stuff and feel. Winn's fastball has flat plane and lives up in the zone- which nicely compliments his 12-6- snapdragon curveball which flashes plus and has a plus spin rate. He's also the best high school sequencer in the draft- able to locate any of his offspeed pitches in various effective locations and throw them for strikes to start at-bats. He projects as an above-average big league starter and is relatively polished for a prep arm- so he could move quickly. There's a 'rumor flying around about an underslot deal with the Giants at pick #2- but otherwise he's likely in the mix starting at pick 8.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55    As a junior- Winn was named the Colorado State High School Pitcher of the Year. He won't be able to repeat- as he transferred to Southern California powerhouse Orange Lutheran for his senior year. That has given the projectable right-hander a lot more exposure and from USA Baseball's National High School Invitatitonal and throughout the spring- the Texas Christian commit has risen to the occasion.    Winn's spring has moved him up to the upper-echelon group of high school arms. He flashes three plus pitches- carrying his fastball deep into starts and showing an improved slider with new life. His slider was more of a cutter at first- with not a ton of tilt to it- then it was slurvy- and now it's often a plus three-quarters power breaker he throws for strikes. He's not afraid to throw a changeup when he needs it- but he doesn't need it. With his clean and easy delivery- he should develop more consistent command.    With a strong spring against a much higher level of competition to go along with high grades for his leadership and work ethic- there's a big up arrow next to Winn's name and he was moving up firmly into the first round as the Draft approached.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JTWvLDwruWs?autoplay=1,|,2389,74,195,|,,,,TEX,15,,,,|,Orange Lutheran HS CA,TCU,Orange Lutheran (Calif.)

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  A shoulder injury that kept him out for his entire sophomore season combined with the track record of pitchers coming out of Rice hurt Duplantier's stock leading into the 2016 Draft despite a healthy junior campaign. Those concerns weren't assuaged when he threw just one inning in his pro debut due to elbow soreness- but he took a huge step toward erasing doubts with a dominant and healthy first full season that saw him lead the Minors in ERA while pitching across two levels and attending the Futures Game.  Strong and athletic- Duplantier has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success. While his fastball usually sits in the 92-94 mph range- he can reach back for more when needed. He throws it with sink and run and was as effective in getting ground-ball outs as he was in missing bats in 2017. He added a slider to his arsenal and it might end up being his best secondary offering- with plus potential. He still throws an effective curveball as well. He has feel for a changeup- giving him the chance for a very effective four-pitch mix. He's around the strike zone more than enough to remain a starter.  Duplantier's next challenge will be the upper levels of the D-backs system. His combination of athleticism- stuff and command point to a ceiling of a frontline starter- especially the further he puts those injury concerns in his rearview mirror.,,,,,|,1612,76,225,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,3rd rd 2016,Rice,,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,50,55,,,,45,60,55,50,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,55,55,,,,50

The Tigers have proceeded with understandable caution- holding the 6-foot-6 right-hander back in extended Spring Training to start his first full year of pro ball. He eventually pitched his way from short-season Connecticut to full-season West Michigan- capping his season off with a 10-strikeout performance in the Midwest League playoffs.    Manning has as much- if not more- upside than any pitcher in the Tigers system- but he also might have the farthest to go to reach it. As he works to refine his delivery- his command and velocity have fluctuated. When he's in sync- he's easily in the low-90s with the ability to touch 95-96 mph with ease. It's easy to dream on more consistent velocity as he figures things out. His power curve has the chance to be a plus pitch in the future- and while his changeup lags behind- he's shown some feel for it and it should give him a third at-least-average offering at his disposal.    Manning's command fluctuated largely because of mechanical flaws- which his athleticism should help him iron out as he progresses. It's going to take time- but the end product could very well be a frontline starter. Manning started the year on the disabled list with a minor oblique strain.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0FhH_Sv17Dg?autoplay=1,,|,1707,78,190,|,DET,det,DET,,,1st rd 2016,Sheldon HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,,55,,,,30,60,50,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,65,50,60,,,,,50

His issues aren't hard to correct.    Full Report:  Gorman hit well on the summer showcase circuit as a rising senior and was generally considered to be the best high school hitter in the country entering his senior year. His body- defense and ability to hit breaking balls all backed up this spring- but most of the industry thinks these things are fixable or insignificant. Gorman's long hand path should be relatively easy for pro coaches to fix and a pro conditioning program should make him viable at third as long as Gorman works at it- and teams buy that he has the makeup to do it. As long as Gorman identifies pro breaking balls- his huge raw power -- visually- scouts have 70s on it but Gorman's summer exit velos were top of the scale for his age -- will play in games. He should be off the board after pick 8 or 9.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55    If a player's Draft status was tied directly to home run derby performances- Gorman might be the No. 1 pick in the Draft. The Arizona prep infielder took long ball crowns at the MLB All-Star Game High School Home Run Derby in Miami and at the Under Armour All-American Game at Wrigley Field in Chicago.    The left-handed hitter has as much raw power as anyone in the class- with some scouts giving it as high as a 70 grade on the 20-to-80 scale. And it is power that does show up in games- though he didn't swing the bat consistently well all summer. There are some holes in his swing- which will lead to some swing and miss- but those who have seen him when he's locked in have seen his ultra-quick hands and bat speed. He did show that he can make hard contact against good competition at times over the summer- though he'd been a bit inconsistent this spring. One concern was whether he could stick at third- and while Gorman showed well at the hot corner at a variety of summer events- some of those worries did resurface this spring.    If a scouting director saw Gorman at the right time- he might think of the University of Arizona commit as a top 10 pick and one of the best high school hitters in the country. Even with an up-and-down senior season- he still looks like one of the better power hitting prospects in the class.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/_2qk0vq7IEA?autoplay=1,|,2392,73,210,|,,,,STL,19,,,,|,O'Connor HS AZ,Arizona,O'Connor (Ariz.)

But then the injury bug- which has plagued him throughout his career- derailed his season. While he'll still be just 23 years old for nearly all of 2018- recurring hamstring issues have clouded his outlook a bit.  When Meadows has been able to stay on the field- he's shown the plus hit tool that made him a top 10 pick. He has a very smooth left-handed swing- still largely generated for contact- to go along with an advanced approach at the plate that allows him to draw walks and limit strikeouts. His power started to show up more in 2016- but wasn't there during his healthy time the following season. He runs well- covering a lot of ground in the outfield and stealing bases- though some wonder how the hamstring injuries will impact that part of his game. He's capable of playing center field- though some see a move to left in his future- where there will be more pressure for the power to show up more consistently.  Despite the injuries- Meadows is still ahead of the curve from an age/level standpoint. More than anything- he needs to stay off the disabled list so he's ready whenever that first call to Pittsburgh comes.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/DGW11I8agcw?autoplay=1,,|,114,75,210,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,1st rd 2013,Grayson HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,STL,0.500,XXX,|,45,40,55,60,45,40,60,45,55,55,50,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,60,40,55,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 60 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  Viewed by scouts as one of the premier offensive talents in the 2015 international class- Soto- at age 16- signed with the Nationals for $1.5 million- at the time a franchise record for a Latin American teenager. His performance during instructional league inspired the Nationals to send him stateside for his pro debut the next year- and the young outfielder rewarded the organization by winning the Gulf Coast League MVP Award en route to a late-season promotion to Class A Short-Season Auburn. Beset by injuries in 2017- Soto missed time due to an ankle injury- a broken hamate bone and a hamstring injury- respectively- though he still finished with a .360 average in his first taste of full-season ball.   Soto possesses natural hitting and plays well beyond his years. His left-handed swing is smooth and rhythmic- allowing Soto to consistently barrel the ball and generate hard contact from line to line. He has the bat speed and barrel control to handle good fastballs and also receives raves for his ability to recognize spin at a young age. He already has good strength to his frame with more room to grow- and scouts expect that his feel for hitting will help him get to his well above-average raw power in games. Defensively- Soto has spent the bulk of his time in right field- where his average speed and arm strength are clean fits.  Soto has the makings of a middle-of-the-order hitter and a potential batting champion at maturity- especially if he can continue to add power in the coming years. Even if he doesn't- the bat alone could make him an impactful regular in the big leagues.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Uu0OZm4SJ9Q?autoplay=1,,|,1091,73,185,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - WSH,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,55,45,40,55,55,55,60,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,60,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

JC before transferring to Jacksonville and leading the Atlantic Sun Conference in home runs (16) as a junior in 2016. The Orioles made him their third-round pick that June- and Hays immediately rewarded the club with a strong pro debut. That success followed Hays into his first full season- as he erupted to hit .329 with 32 home runs and 32 doubles between Class A Advanced Frederick and Double-A Bowie to earn a September callup. The first hitter from his Draft class to reach the Majors- Hays appeared in 20 games for the Orioles during the final month-plus of the regular season.  Hays features a short but explosive swing- combining bat speed with natural feel for the barrel to generate hard contact to all fields- with easy- plus raw power to his pull side. He can handle velocity fine and has a knack for punishing mistakes- though an aggressive approach does make him vulnerable to quality secondary offerings. That should improve with experience- giving Hays the potential for an above-average bat with similar- if not better power in his prime.   Hays spent much of 2017 in center field before reaching the Majors- where he logged more time in right (14 games) than center (eight). His speed and range- both slightly above average- make him a quality defender at both positions- while his accurate- plus arm is a natural fit in right.

Full Report:  Stewart got headlines over the summer for his historic curveball spin rates that regularly were in the elite 3000+ rpm range- notable even for big leaguers. Entering the year- Stewart was a lanky projection arm that sat 88-92 mph and- if his velocity jumped into the mid-90's like scouts were predicting- he'd move into the first half of round one. That's exactly what happened. Stewart came out of the gates strong and in the middle of the spring was regularly sitting 92-96- hitting 98 mph and flashing a 70 curveball- as well as other starter traits. His finish to the spring was rough as he dealt with a minor injury and he had a couple starts where he topped at 94 mph after sitting there weeks before. Some scouts don't like his on-mound demeanor. Stewart still offers perhaps arguably the highest upside among the prep arms and didn't really have any blemishes on his resume until the last month- so she should still go in the top 10-12 picks- unless clubs are out on prep arms altogether due to preceived risk.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 65 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  Stewart jumped on the radar with a strong summer showcase circuit showing at a number of events. When he came out this spring even better- with more velocity- he made a huge leap to near the top of many Draft boards.  With a projectable 6-foot-6 frame- there was always the thought that there might be more in Stewart's tank in the future. Evidently- the future is now. He has been as lights out as any prep arm in the country- coming out of the gate up to 98 mph and touching 96-97 mph in just about every start and easily sits 92-94 mph. He has one of the best breaking balls in the class- a power curve that is now a mid-80s hammer. While his changeup is behind right now- and he occasionally slows his arm down- he has feel for it and it should be a solid pitch in the future.  While some have expressed mild concern with a deep arm action in the back- Stewart has shown he can fill up the strike zone with two current plus pitches. The Mississippi State has moved into the top of the first round conversation- with some thinking he would be a candidate to go 1-1 if it weren't for the fact a high school right-hander has never been taken with the top pick.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VPPae4eCvXg?autoplay=1,|,2387,78,200,|,,,,ATL,8,,,,|,Eau Gallie HS FL,Mississippi State,Eau Gallie (Fla.)

He continued to move quickly in 2015- advancing to Double-A at age 19 and then turning in a strong showing as the Arizona Fall League's youngest player. Bauers built on that success in his return to the Southern League in 2016- establishing career highs in most offensive categories- and he was solid yet again in '17 as one of the Triple-A International League's youngest players.  Bauers has a knack for barreling the ball from the left side of the plate- with a compact- clean swing that fuels his use of the whole field. He's begun to hit the ball in the air with greater consistency in the last two seasons- and more power could be on the way as he develops physically and becomes more comfortable turning on the ball. Bauers' advanced approach and feel for working counts drive his on-base skills- as he paced the International League in walks (78) after ranking second in Southern League in 2016.   Defensively- Bauers spent much of 2017 in Durham's outfield before returning to first base- his natural position- in August. He's considerably better at first- where he's athletic and smooth around the bag with a slick glove- although his lack of power does complicate his offensive profile.

He offered one of the best power/speed combinations available- which prompted the Giants to draft him 19th overall and sign him for $3-101-700. He continued to perform well in his pro debut- leading the Rookie-level Arizona League in slugging (.645) and finishing second in batting (.348) and OPS (1.049).  While he needs a few years of development time- Ramos has the highest ceiling of any Giants prospect since Buster Posey. His bat speed and strength generate well-above-average power from the right side of the plate- and he already shows the ability to drive the ball out of the park to all fields. Part of an athletic family that includes brothers in the Dodgers system (Henry- an outfielder) and on Puerto Rico's national soccer team (Hector)- Heliot has at least plus speed as well as solid arm strength.  The biggest question with Ramos is whether he can develop a more patient approach and make consistent contact so he can realize his offensive potential. He also needs to refine his reads and routes in order to stay in center field. Time is on his side- as he'll play the entire 2018 season at age 18.,,,,,|,2090,74,185,|,SFG,sf,SF,,,1st rd 2017,Leadership Christian (PR),,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,60,40,60,40,60,70,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,60,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Liberatore has a prototypical pitcher's build- is athletic for his size- his delivery is relatively clean (though arguably lacking deception) and- most importantly- Libby has monster- bat-missing stuff when he's humming. At times this spring he's sat 93-97 mph in the early innings of his starts while flashing a plus-plus curveball- above-average changeup and newly-minted- average slider. Though he's also had spurts where he's been an erratic 88-92 mph and relied on tricks like quick pitches- Liberatore has arguably been the most consistent high school pitcher in the country and tops that category on our board. The Giants were in heavy to see him early on- but now his likely range of selection seems to be in the 7-13 range.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55    In an age when radar gun readings often rule the day- Liberatore stood out on the summer showcase circuit more with his feel for pitching than plus velocity. He threw 12 shutout innings for the 18U U.S. National Team- and there was a reason he got the ball for their gold medal game against Korea- won by Liberatore thanks to his six scoreless frames.    There are better fastballs among the deep high school pitching crop in this Draft class- but Liberatore's pitchability is what separates him. That's not to say he doesn't have good stuff- because he has the potential to eventually develop three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range- maintaining the velocity throughout his starts- and he opened some eyes by touching 96-97 mph frequently in the early stages of the spring. He's also made mechanical changes to vastly improve his command of the pitch. He throws a slower curveball with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate and introduced a new- and very effective- slider this spring. And his changeup gives him a third secondary pitch that could be plus when all is said and done.    The top left-hander in the Draft class- Liberatore has thrown well enough this spring to cement himself as a potential top 10 pick in June.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/IayXSFEwcVU?autoplay=1,|,2386,77,200,|,,,,TB,16,,,,|,Mountain Ridge HS AZ,Arizona,Mountain Ridge (Ariz.)

He excelled across two Rookie levels during his eye-opening stateside debut- finishing the season with a strong 14-game showing in the Appalachian League- and then made even greater strides in the Midwest League in 2017. Playing the entire season at age 19- Sanchez finished second in the circuit with a .305 average and produced 15 home runs in 117 games.   Sanchez's offensive ceiling offers reason for excitement- as he's already shown that he can hit for average and apply his power during games at a young age. He has a fluid swing with an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate- with an advanced approach and knack for hitting the ball in the air that belie his age. Sanchez is an above-average runner who is still learning to effectively use his speed on the basepaths and in left field- where he projects as at least an above-average defender with a strong arm.  Though Sanchez is in the nascent stage of his career- his loud offensive tools and remaining physical projection could make him a middle-of-the-order force at maturity.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ybem0ytsehY?autoplay=1,,|,2245,75,210,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2014 - TB,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,55,50,50,60,50,55,60,50,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,55,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

He has moved quickly- beginning 2017 by batting .357 in the World Baseball Classic for Mexico and ending it in Los Angeles- where he hit his first big league homer off Adam Ottavino. In between- he batted .314 as the youngest regular (age 21) in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League- where he was just one of two regulars with more walks (52) than strikeouts (50).    One of the best pure hitting prospects in baseball- Verdugo recognizes pitches and controls the strike zone better than most players his age. He uses the whole field- repeatedly barreling balls with a quick left-handed stroke geared for line drives. Though he homered just seven times in 132 games last season- his hitting ability- bat speed and strength should translate into average power if he adds some loft to his swing.    As good as he is in the batter's box- Verdugo's best tool actually is his plus-plus arm. Despite average speed- he has spent much of his pro career in center field- where his instincts help him get the job done. Scouts are split on whether he can handle center on a daily basis in the Majors- but no one doubts that his arm would play in right.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/mRH_od9cYyw?autoplay=1,,|,754,72,205,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,2nd rd 2014,Sahuaro HS (AZ),,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,50,40,55,45,50,60,60,50,55,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,50,70,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 60 | Overall: 55    Fowler was set to continue his career at Georgia Southern before the Yankees selected him in the 18th round and offered him a $278-000 bonus- the largest above-slot bonus handed out by the organization in the 2013 Draft. He blossomed into a potential five-tool player in the subsequent years- ultimately earning his first big league callup in June 2017 after an impressive Triple-A campaign. But a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee- suffered when he ran into the wall down the right-field line in his Major League debut- required immediate surgery and prematurely ended Fowler's season. Nearly a month later- he was dealt to the A's with James Kaprielian and Jorge Mateo at the Trade Deadline for right-hander Sonny Gray.    Fowler has grown as a hitter in each of his five seasons. Employing a short-but-impactful swing- he makes lots of hard contact- driving the ball across the entire field. Fowler generates good pop for his size and could produce 15 to 20 home runs at the highest level- while his plus speed nets him plenty of doubles and triples and gives him impact potential on the basepaths. Fowler doesn't have much swing-and-miss to his game- though he does stand to benefit from more selectivity in his approach.    Fowler's outfield defense improved considerably during his time with the Yankees- thanks in part to his work with outfield instructor Reggie Willits. It's led to more playing time in center field- where he profiles as at least an above-average defender- since the start of 2016. While the impact of his knee injury has yet to be seen- Fowler's across-the-board tools and strong track record of performance points to him becoming an everyday player- if not more.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/FLb3S3KNFvk?autoplay=1,,|,1433,72,195,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,18th rd 2013,West Laurens HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,50,40,55,60,45,45,55,50,55,60,50,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,60,50,60,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2020.,Scouting Grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 60 | Overall: 55  Luzardo was already highly regarded by scouts for his pitchability and polish before a velocity jump early in his senior season thrust him into the first-round conversation. Though he would undergo Tommy John surgery in March- the Nationals were happy to gamble on him in the third round and lured him away from a Miami commitment with a $1.4 million bonus- more than twice pick value. He would make his pro debut in the Gulf Coast League nearly one year later- and the A's acquired him and Sheldon Neuse for Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson the following month. He finished the season with a dominant performance in the New York-Penn League.  Luzardo showed the same velocity during his pro debut that he did before his elbow injury- as the southpaw consistently operated in the mid-90s while bumping 98 mph. The pitch has natural sinking action- while Luzardo's feel for commanding it to both sides of the plate in turn sets up a plus changeup that features significant late fade and sink. Luzardo also demonstrates a feel for adding and subtracting with his curveball- while his entire arsenal plays up on account of his advanced control and command.  Luzardo's combination of stuff and polish should help him move quickly through the Minor Leagues- though the A's are sure to remain protective of the young lefty as he continues to distance himself from elbow surgery. If he can stay healthy- Luzardo could develop into a No. 3 starter- if not more.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/XPMeIpPKW2k?autoplay=1,,|,1741,73,205,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,3rd rd 2016,Stoneman Douglas HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,,,,,45,55,60,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,65,60,50,,,,,60

ETA late 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  Gary Sanchez's development made Brian McCann redundant on the Yankees- so they sent McCann to the Astros for right-handers Abreu and Jorge Guzman in November 2016. While McCann helped Houston win the 2017 World Series- New York has no complaints with the deal- because Abreu shows the upside of a frontline starter and Guzman became the headline prospect in the Giancarlo Stanton trade with the Marlins. Signed for $185-000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2013- Abreu pitched just 53 1/3 innings last summer while dealing with a shoulder strain- but was one of the more impressive arms in the Arizona Fall League. Abreu's start to the 2018 season was delayed as he recovers from an appendectomy he underwent in February.   When Abreu is at his best- he exhibits command of three pitches that all grade as plus or better. His fastball usually runs from 93-98 mph- tops out in the triple digits and features sink and run that generate both swings and misses as well as weak ground-ball contact. His power breaking ball looks like a curveball at times and a slider at others- more often the former- and he also can miss bats with his fading changeup.  Abreu has a bit of a short-arm delivery that adds deception- making him all the more difficult to hit. His walk rate dropped from 4.5 per nine innings in three years in the Astros system to 3.0 in his first with the Yankees- quieting talk that he might be destined for the bullpen. He still needs more consistency with his secondary pitches and his command but made encouraging progress in those areas last year.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/8UBks6qnE-Q?autoplay=1,,|,1852,74,175,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,Aug. 5- 2013 - HOU,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,65,55,55,,,,,40,65,65,60,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,65,55,55,,,,,50

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  A teammate of Lucas Giolito's at Harvard-Westlake High School in California- Fried went No. 7 overall in the 2012 Draft to the Padres- nine spots ahead of his injured teammate. He followed Giolito with his own Tommy John surgery in 2014 and was traded to the Braves that winter in the Justin Upton trade. He didn't make his Braves debut until 2016- but made a solid big league debut in 2017 despite an uneven campaign in Double-A- capping it all off with a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League.  Fried has always had good stuff- especially his fastball-curve combination- but struggles with commanding it have hampered him at times. He might never have outstanding fastball command- but it was better during his big league stint and was even better in the AFL. His fastball will sit in the 92-96 mph range and he continues to have one of the best breaking balls in the Minors- a plus curve he manipulates well. His changeup is his third pitch- but it does allow him to give hitters a different look.  During his dominant AFL stretch- Fried showed a much better understanding of what would and wouldn't work against big league hitters.

The Texas native went to full-season ball in his first full professional year and pitched well there under a fairly tight pitch count and innings limit. In year two- the gloves came off and the right-hander earned a midseason promotion to Double-A while also pitching well in the Futures Game.    Much of Burrows' success has come as a result of his plus fastball. It will sit in the low 90s and will consistently touch the mid-90s with the pitch- thrown with good life down in the zone and improved overall command- allowing him to miss bats. His secondary stuff still needs refinement- and he struggled at times with it after moving up to Double-A- but he can spin a very good curve- has added a slider and has continued to work on developing his changeup.    Continued work on his offspeed stuff will help Burrows continue to climb the Tigers' ladder- but everything is pointing in the right direction. He looks like a future big league starter- and if his non-fastball offerings improve greatly at age 21 in 2018- he could develop into more of a frontline guy.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/wrcFf1O63-8?autoplay=1,,|,1271,74,200,|,DET,det,DET,,,1st rd 2015,Weatherford HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,45,45,,,,45,60,55,50,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,55,45,,,,50

His elite arm strength caught the attention of the Yankees- however- and they acquired him and Albert Abreu for Brian McCann in November 2016. Guzman was on the move again the following offseason- this time going to the Marlins with Jose Devers and Starlin Castro in the Giancarlo Stanton blockbuster.  Guzman's lightning-quick arm and relatively easy delivery produces exceptional velocity in a fastball that sits 97-103 mph as a starter. He struggles to control the pitch at times but showed better strike-throwing ability in 2017 after improving his mechanics. Guzman's power slider is an above-average pitch and complements his heater nicely- and he also has changeup in its nascent stages.  Improved control and command- along with his tremendous arm strength- enabled Guzman to make strides on all fronts in 2017- and he'll be forced to make even more adjustments in the coming years. While he has yet to pitch at a full-season level- Guzman has the ingredients to become a No. 3 starter or a dominant closer.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/97COg64IK0I?autoplay=1,,|,2271,74,182,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,June 15- 2014 - HOU,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,45,,50,,,,40,80,55,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,80,45,,55,,,,45

His first taste of full-season ball in 2017 saw him take a huge leap forward- and he finished fourth in the South Atlantic League in strikeouts and ninth in ERA.  Medina has always had a good feel for pitching- and in 2017 everything took a step forward- stuff-wise. While he featured a 90-95 mph fastball previously- he sat more 92-94 mph and touched 95-96 more consistently in 2017. He commands his heater well and throws it with a lot of life- leading to a steady ground-ball rate. His secondary stuff improved as well- with a sharper breaking ball- now a slider. His changeup flashes above-average- with more consistent feel for it. He throws all three for strikes- and the increased sharpness led to a much better strikeout rate.  The full season of innings allowed Medina to work on his full repertoire and when to use it. With his feel for pitching and improving stuff- Medina certainly has an up arrow next to his name.

Since signing for $1.2 million and making some simple mechanical adjustments- he has dominated in pro ball. He led the Minors with 191 strikeouts in 141 1/3 innings last year while finishing his first full season in Double-A. Hansen began the year on the disabled list with right forearm soreness suffered early in Spring Training.  Hansen's fastball sits at 94-97 mph early in games and tops out at 99- and its running life and the downhill plane he generates with his 6-foot-7 frame make it all the more difficult to hit. He owns a pair of power breaking balls- a curveball with 12-to-6 break and a slider with late tilt- and the curve has been more effective since he turned pro. He'll flash an average changeup at times- but it still needs more work.  The concerns that dogged Hansen in the Draft still exist to some extent. There's effort in his delivery- which costs him not only control and command- but also some velocity in the late innings. He has cut his walk rate from 6.0 per nine innings in college to 3.3 in his first two years as a pro- though some evaluators still think he's destined for the bullpen rather than the rotation.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VQzZu_90hZk?autoplay=1,,|,1682,79,235,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,2nd rd 2016,Oklahoma,,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,60,45,,,,40,60,45,60,50,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,50,60,55,,,,45

After signing for $1-327-600 as a 2013 second-rounder- McMahon cruised through the lower Minors before batting .242 with 161 strikeouts in Double-A in 2016. He righted himself last year- finishing second in the Minors in hitting (.355) and making his big league debut in August.    McMahon's left-handed swing got too long and too uphill in 2016- but he fixed it last year and recorded the best numbers of his career. He cut his strikeout rate to 18 percent- down from 27 percent in his first four pro seasons- and he let the natural loft in his stroke produce power instead of selling out for home runs. He should hit for average and power while benefiting from Coors Field- though he doesn't draw many walks.    McMahon has solid arm strength and spent the first three years of his pro career at third base- but he was erratic there and wasn't going to dislodge Nolan Arenado from the hot corner in Colorado. He saw most of his action at first base in 2016-17 and began playing second base last year.

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  The son of former big league pitcher Tom Gordon and brother of the Mariners' Dee Gordon- Nick Gordon has moved slowly and steadily- one level at a time- up the Twins' organizational ladder ever since he was taken as the No. 5 overall pick in the 2014 Draft. His move to the upper levels of the system in 2017 was largely a successful one- including a Futures Game invite and Southern League All-Star nod- though he did struggle in the second half of the season.  Gordon is the type of player who may not jump off the page with any one tool- but does a number of things well. He's typically employed a successful contact-oriented- line-drive approach from the left side of the plate. He did show more extra-base power in Double-A- but with that came a higher strikeout rate- though an increased walk rate offset that to a degree. He's a solid runner with good instincts and will steal a base on occasion- and is a tick above-average defensively- both in terms of his arm and overall actions at shortstop. Many have felt his range points to being a better fit at second base and while he did still primarily play short- he did see more time on the right side of the infield in 2017.  Gordon will be 22 for all of the 2018 season and is knocking on the big league door. He's more of a high floor than ceiling type and isn't far away from showing just what kind of solid everyday big leaguer he can be- on either side of second base.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/bXiuMCdQJP4?autoplay=1,,|,803,72,160,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,1st rd 2014,Olympia HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,40,30,55,50,45,60,50,45,55,50,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,50,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

When MLB discovered the discrepancy- it barred him from signing for one year and he landed with the Yankees in March 2015 after producing a Haitian birth certificate with a slightly different birthdate. His $200-000 bonus -- a fraction of what he would have commanded without the controversy -- looks like a bargain because he has the best all-around tools in New York's deep system and earned a spot in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game while making his full-season debut in 2017.  Florial has three tools that grade as well above average in his raw power- speed and arm strength. With the quickness and loft in his left-handed stroke- he's built to do a lot of damage at Yankee Stadium. The only question he has to answer is whether he can tone down his aggressive approach and make consistent contact after posting a 31 percent strikeout rate last season and a 36 percent mark in the Arizona Fall League. He lost some needed at-bats and development time when he had surgery on his right hamate in mid-May- a procedure that could keep him out until August.  While his swing-and-miss issues mean there's a wide gap between his ceiling and floor- Florial doesn't have to hit for high average to help a team win. He's as raw on the bases as he is at the plate- but his double-plus speed could make him a 30-30 player if he adds the necessary polish. While he's still learning in center field as well- he should be able to stick there and his arm is a weapon anywhere in the outfield.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/mYK2ssfvC80?autoplay=1,,|,2223,73,185,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2014,Haiti,March 19- 2015 - NYY,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,60,40,60,40,55,60,60,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,70,65,60,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting Grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 65 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  The son of former big leaguer Paul Quantrill- Cal made three starts as a Stanford sophomore before undergoing Tommy John surgery- which would cost him all of 2016. The Padres- after seeing him throw several bullpen sessions at Petco Park ahead of the Draft- ended up using their first of five Day 1 picks on Quantrill- selecting him eighth overall and then signing him for above slot value at $3-963-045. The Ontario native pitched at three levels- including the Class A Midwest League- during his pro debut and then reached Double-A in his first full season- after which he suited up for the World Team in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game.  Quantrill's deep arsenal features a pair of plus-or-better offerings in a 92-95 mph fastball that can reach 97- and a low-80s changeup that's among the best in the Minors. His slider at times can be inconsistent but still projects as an above-average offering- and he made strides in advancing his curveball in his first full season. Quantrill has feel for locating each of his pitches- particularly his fastball-changeup combo- and scouts expect him to miss more bats once his breaking balls improve.   A healthy first full season in which Quantrill logged 116 innings and maintained his velocity deep into games helped lay to rest any lingering concerns about his health. While the Padres will likely manage his workload once again in 2018- it shouldn't stop Quantrill- with his impressive blend of size- stuff and pitchability- from continuing his quick rise through the Minor Leagues.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/xNKf2IgKKqY?autoplay=1,,|,1713,75,208,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,1st rd 2016,Stanford,,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,45,40,,,,40,50,60,50,45,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,65,50,50,,,,55

Eligible to sign out of Venezuela in July 2011- he didn't land a pro contract until 15 months later and earned just a $10-000 bonus. He led the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League with a 1.07 ERA in his 2013 pro debut- then did little to distinguish himself until last season- when he reached Double-A and looked like a future No. 3 starter.  Alzolay's stuff improved as he got stronger and starting doing a better job of incorporating his lower half in his delivery. He now deals at 92-96 mph and reaches 98 with his fastball- which has some running life to help keep it off barrels. His curveball isn't as reliable- but it's often a plus pitch with low-80s velocity and good depth.  Alzolay still is working on his changeup- which has more movement than deception and ultimately can become an average offering. He has pounded the strike zone sine signing and does a good job of avoiding home runs despite being a fly-ball pitcher.

After signing for $3.65 million- a franchise record for a drafted pitcher- he did little in his first two years as a pro. Groome made three short starts in his debut before a lat strain and forearm soreness limited him to 55 1/3 innings in 2017- and he won't pitch at all this year after having Tommy John surgery in May.  Groome has spent most of his pro career working in the low 90s with armside run on his fastball- though he hit 97 mph as an amateur and should add more consistent velocity as he gets stronger and healthier. Even if his heater climbs into the mid-90s- it will take a back seat to a curveball with power and depth that was the consensus best breaking ball in his Draft class. He has some feel for a changeup that flashes some sink- but it lacks consistency because he hasn't had much experience throwing it yet.  Though Groome averaged 4.9 walks per nine innings in his first two seasons as a pro- his athleticism and clean delivery bode well for his ability to provide more strikes in the future. His 6-foot-6 frame lends itself to durability and creating tough downhill plane on his pitches.

Wentz followed the script perfectly- signing for just over $3 million as the 40th overall pick in the 2016 Draft- then finishing second in the South Atlantic League in strikeouts and fourth in ERA during his introduction to full-season ball.  Wentz has a solid- if unspectacular- three-pitch mix that he has shown an ability to use well to dominate hitters. He'll be able to sit comfortably with his fastball in the 92-93 mph range- and it plays up because of its life and his ability to command it well. His curve and changeup both flash above-average to plus and he's shown a willingness to go to one secondary pitch if the other one isn't working on any given night. He has a feel to spin the breaking ball- but it could use a little more sharpness to become a true out pitch.  Wentz is a plus competitor who showed he could handle getting out of trouble when he needed to. He might not have the highest ceiling of the core of talented young pitchers in the Braves system- but he seems a strong bet to fit nicely into the middle of a rotation in the future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/xmXHVoWqXHQ?autoplay=1,,|,1710,77,210,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2016,Shawnee Mission East HS (MO),,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,60,45,,,,,45,50,60,55,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,55,55,,,,,50

His immediate success as a teenager against full-season competition caught the Padres' attention- and they acquired him for Drew Pomeranz during the 2016 All-Star break. Unfortunately for both Espinoza and the Padres- the right-hander's 2017 season was over before it began- as he opened the year on the disabled list with right forearm tightness before undergoing Tommy John surgery in August.  Though he may be small in stature- there's nothing diminutive about Espinoza's stuff when healthy. His smooth delivery and lightning-quick arm produce a heater that can touch triple digits- though he typically works in the 94-97 mph range with late movement. Espinoza's curveball shows plus potential but lacked consistency at times in 2016- while his changeup- thrown with fastball-like arm action as well as considerable sink- gives the teenager a true chance for three plus pitches once he matures. Beyond the stuff- Espinoza repeats his mechanics well and demonstrates advanced control and command for a hurler his age.  Espinoza had progressed to throwing bullpen sessions in July before it was announced he would require season-ending surgery. He could potentially return to the mound at the end of the 2018 season if all goes as planned with his recovery and rehab- though it wouldn't come as a surprise if San Diego conservatively pushed that back to 2019.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LMN6OIaQsEA?autoplay=1,,|,695,72,160,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,J2 2014,Venezuela,July 2- 2014 - BOS,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,,,,,40,60,60,60,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,60,55,,,,,50

The performance- along with a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May- during which he hit 102 mph- gave the right-hander some serious helium ahead of the 2017 Draft. The Blue Jays ended up selecting Pearson 28th overall with the second of their two first-round picks- then signed him for slightly above slot value at $2-452-900. Pearson continued to thrive in his pro debut- turning in a lights-out performance with Class A Short Season Vancouver after a brief stop in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.  Pearson's four-pitch mix is highlighted by the best fastball and slider in Toronto's system. He was consistently up to 97-98 mph with his fastball during the spring and threw even harder in his pro debut- at times bumping triple digits- albeit in shorter stints. Pearson has already cleaned up his slider since signing and now throws it with more power and tilt in the upper 80s- giving him a legitimate put-away pitch to complement his explosive fastball. His changeup is currently ahead of his curveball- with the former grading out as an average pitch and the curve being more fringy.   There's some concern regarding Pearson's durability because he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school- but the 6-foot-6 hurler was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college and during his debut. Provided he stays healthy- Pearson seems well on his way toward becoming a No. 3 starter- perhaps more if he can improve his secondaries and overall command.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/t_D8-uewjYw?autoplay=1,,|,2033,78,245,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,1st rd 2017,Central Florida JC,,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,65,50,,50,,,,35,70,55,,55,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,50,45,55,,,,45

Since then- the only thing that's slowed him from developing into one of the better lefty prospects in the game was a minor shoulder issue that delayed the start to his 2017 season in Double-A- though he still pitched well enough to reach Triple-A for the first time.  The 6-foot-5 southpaw uses a combination of pitchability and deception that allows his largely solid-average stuff to play up and miss bats consistently. He'll largely pitch with his fastball in the low 90s- with the ability to reach for an extra tick or two on occasion- thrown with good riding life. His changeup remains his best secondary pitch- one he throws with good sink and effectively keeps down in the zone. His curve should give him a third Major League average offering when all is said and done.  Gonsalves did a much better job of commanding the baseball in 2017 and improved control of all his pitches should allow him to have continued success at the upper levels of the system.

Many teams liked him more as a pitcher- but the Braves were more than willing to let him swing the bat. A slow starter in each of his first two full pro seasons- Riley still mashed his way to Double-A at age 20- collecting 20 or more home runs in each of those years. He capped off 2017 with a strong Arizona Fall League- finishing first in slugging- second in home runs and third in OPS.  There has never been any question about Riley's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts- he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in 2017 while moving up the ladder. Riley also made huge strides in his defense at third and there are no longer concerns about his ability to stay at the hot corner- where his plus arm has always played well. He runs better than people might think at first glance- and some feel his athleticism would allow him to move to left field if there was a need or someone blocking him in Atlanta.   For now- he'll continue to improve in all facets of the game as a third baseman- where he looks like he'll fit the power-hitting- run-producing profile in the mold of a Troy Glaus type of player.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/U7WhBMK_uYA?autoplay=1,,|,1321,75,220,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2015,DeSoto Central HS (MS),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,35,45,65,45,40,60,45,60,65,40,45,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,60,40,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Because of the local weather- high school baseball in Wisconsin doesn't get underway until late May- which would have made Kelenic impossible to scout were there not alternatives. Kelenic ended up on a youth travel team called Hitters Baseball which played lots of weekend games at any of three facilities near Kenosha and in Cedar Rapids. The concentration of opposing talent in these games was sufficient enough that teams thought Kelenic reinforced what they saw from him as an underclassman. He's a selective hitter with all-fields doubles power and a chance to stay in center field.Kelenic is almost 19 and already quite physically mature- each considered negatives by the scouting community- but he comes with a long track record most prep hitters do not. Opinions vary regarding Kelenic's physical projection and how it might affect his power output and ultimate defensive home- but Kelenic's bat is stable enough that he's one of the higher-floor high school prospects. With few college hitters in the mid-first round mix- Kelenic could be considered a viable- slightly toolsier alternative to college hitting as early as pick #6.,Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  Kelenic has the tools and track record to become the first Wisconsin product ever selected in the top 10 picks- and at the very least should become just the seventh Badger Stater ever plucked in the first round. He was the leading hitter on the U.S. national 18-and-under team as a rising junior in 2016 and helped the squad win a gold medal for the second straight summer in 2017. Committed to Louisville- he'll be Draft-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2020 in the unlikely event he makes it to college rather than turning pro.  Compared to a more athletic version of Mark Kotsay- Kelenic stands out most for his hitting ability. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and repeatedly demonstrates a professional approach from the left side of the plate. With his solid raw power and speed- he can contribute offensively in a variety of ways.  Scouts aren't sold that Kelenic can stay in center field all the way up to the big leagues- but his quickness and instincts give him a chance. If he has to move to a corner- he has more than enough arm strength to handle right field.

Full Report:  Bart was a known high school prospect in the Atlanta suburbs and- though a few teams nearly met it- his price tag pushed him to Tech where he's grown into one of this draft's top talents. He has elite feel for the position- projecting as an impact defender with a 65-grade arm despite being bigger than most good defensive ctachers. He also does advance work for every game- calls area scouts for gameplan input- and is possibly the only catcher at a major program that calls his own games. Scouts rave about his makeup.Offensively- Bart has huge power and has hit some tape measure shots- including a ball that went over the football facility roof in left field at Georgia Tech and still hasnt been found. He isnt the most selective hitter and doesnt have the loosest swing in the class- but he has some feel for the bat head and doesnt have trouble with velocity. His power and fly-ball based approach along with these issues mean he could be a 40 or 45 bat with about an average walk rate and anywhere from 50 to 60 game power. Some of his strikeouts this year were a result of getting pitched around. He's seen a lot of off-speed pitches and has altered his approach to hit what he was facing- which likely wont be a big issue in pro ball.Since Bart is so advanced defensively- some scouts have speculated that hell go straight to High-A and could debut in the big leagues in late 2019. This could make him one of those prospects that gets to the big leagues before the holes to his offensive game have been closed because he's so good at everything else. The Giants have been all over Bart all spring and are expected to take him 2nd overall- but he's also a candidate to go 1st if Mize's medical or bonus demands become problematic.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 30 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  Bart's power potential could have gotten him selected in the first five rounds of the Draft after he led Buford High to the 2015 Georgia 4-A state championship- but he dropped to the Rays in the 27th round because he was committed to Georgia Tech. His development at the plate and improvement behind it has him positioned as the top college catcher available in 2018. The Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year and defensive player of the year- he's poised to join Jason Varitek and Matt Wieters as Yellow Jackets backstops popped in the first round- and he's even been linked to the Giants as a possible No. 2 overall pick.Bart's bat speed- strength and leverage give him power to all fields from the right side of the plate. He has the swing and the feel to hit for a solid average- and he has made huge strides with his plate discipline this spring. He has enough natural pop that he doesn't need to sell out for home runs- and he's not falling into that trap as much as he did in the past.  There were questions about Bart's long-term catching ability when he arrived at Georgia Tech- but he has cleaned up his receiving enough that there no longer are doubts that he'll stay behind the plate. His strong arm never has been in question and he threw out 40 percent of basestealers in his first two college seasons. Though he's a well-below-average runner- he's relatively athletic for a catcher.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Cozg_YSvag0?autoplay=1,|,1341,75,225,|,,,,SF,2,,,,|,Georgia Tech,,Georgia Tech,Junior,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,30,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

Three years later- after a huge step forward during his junior season that included a 20-strikeout performance- Peterson landed in the first round and signed for full pick value with the Mets as the No. 20 overall pick. He made a brief pro debut in the short-season New York-Penn League.  Working with pitching coach Jason Dietrich at Oregon- Peterson struck out better than 12.5 per nine and walked just 1.35 per nine as a junior and brings a solid repertoire and that plus control to the pro game. From a velocity standpoint- Peterson's fastball is average- sitting in the low 90s and occasionally touching 95 mpg. But it plays up thanks to its plus sink and his ability to command it. He combines it with a slider that is plus at times and serves as an out pitch and has a changeup that flashes above-average that could be a good weapon against right-handers. He's mixed in a fringy curve for strike one at times in the past.  Despite a lower arm slot- Peterson has shown he has outstanding control of all his pitches- even if he can stand to refine his overall command some.

He really took off in the hitter-friendly California League in 2015- finishing with 32 homers- then showed it was no fluke by winning the Southern League MVP Award the following season. He started slowly in 2017- then found his power stroke again and hit 12 homers in 37 games after being traded from the Mariners to the Cardinals to finish with 31 for the year.    O'Neill's key to success is all about his ability to make enough contact to tap into his prodigious power. He does strike out a lot- whiffing 150 or more times in each of the past two seasons- though he has helped offset that by improving his walk rate. He has plus bat speed and the ability to hit the ball out to all fields- though he can get power-happy at times- which adversely impacts his ability to make hard contact. An average runner at best- O'Neill is athletic enough to play all three outfield positions- but his above-average arm and power profile fit best in right field.    The Cardinals' outfield is a little crowded- but few have the power and run production potential O'Neill has.

Full Report:  India was a heavily-scouted prospect in high school who turned down bonuses well into the six figures to go to Florida. He didn't make much progress his first two years. India arrived on campus a fringy defensive shortstop- became a generic defender at third and slightly above-average college hitter. But that all changed this year. India got in better shape and his tools improved as well: he now has 55 raw power and is an above average defensive third baseman that could play a passable middle infield. In addition to the tool and body composition improvements- India made some subtle adjustments to his approach at the plate and they paid off in a big way- with gaudy power numbers. While nothing he does is plus- India offers clubs a high probability- 2 to 3 win- everyday third baseman. He forced himself much higher on our board than we could have imagined he would at the start of the spring.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  India was a solid- albeit unspectacular- prospect coming out of high school powerhouse American Heritage three years ago- one whose strong commitment to the University of Florida- teams knew would be tough to break. After two fairly pedestrian years with the Gators- along with a pair of summers in the Cape Cod League- the infielder has broken out in a big way during his junior season.  India has been perhaps the best all-around college hitter this spring- showing the ability to impact the game in a number of ways. He has an advanced approach at the plate- showing excellent plate discipline and the ability to hit for average that should translate. His pitch selection has improved tremendously- which in turn has given him better pitches to drive- something he's doing more consistently this year- with some evaluators seeing at least average power from him in the future. He's a solid runner with excellent instincts and can steal a base. India has played a lot of third- but his athleticism and instincts- not to mention his strong arm- could allow him to play any of a number of infield positions at the next level.  College bats are always hard to find- and those who perform in their Draft year tend to shoot to the top of boards. That's exactly what's happening with India- whose performance in the top-notch SEC is putting him into many first-round conversations.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/KPK-GaBvm6U?autoplay=1,|,1310,72,185,|,,,,CIN,5,,,,|,Florida,,Florida,Junior,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,55,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

Although a grim ankle injury prematurely ended his first full season and a broken hamate limited him the following year- a fully healthy Harrison blossomed in 2017- earning Midwest League All-Star honors before advancing to the Carolina League. He finished the season with 21 home runs and 27 stolen bases over 122 games between the two levels- and then firmly put himself on the Major League radar with a standout campaign in the Arizona Fall League. Harrison's breakout caught the attention of the Marlins- and they acquired him with Lewis Brinson- Isan Diaz and Jordan Yamamoto for Christian Yelich in January.  Lewis Brinson might have the loudest tools in Miami's system- but Harrison isn't far behind. He generates plus raw power to all fields thanks to a combination of physical strength and plus bat speed that enables him to turn around velocity. His swing can get long at times- leading to some swing-and-miss issues- and he'll chase breaking balls in the dirt- but the overall approach is solid- giving him a nice foundation as a hitter. Harrison's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender- either in center field or in right- where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit.  Harrison offered a taste of his potential during his breakout 2017 campaign- and the Marlins are justifiably excited about what the future may hold for their new outfielder. If he can stay healthy- Harrison could develop into a perennial 20/20 player who also offers considerable value with his defense.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/RRzOrr9b4V8?autoplay=1,,|,747,75,220,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,2nd rd 2014,Lee's Summit West HS (MO),,|,,,,,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,60,60,45,80,45,55,60,60,50,80,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,60,70,55,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Bohm has a strong- wiry frame and- though it may take a swing tweak to unlock it's full potential in games- he has among the best raw power and power projection in the entire draft. His swing is too contact-oriented. Many college programs emphsize contact-oriented swings because college defenses are bad and the bats allow you to hit for power anyway. Bohm would likely benefit- long-term- from a swing that better loads his hands to take advantage of his strength and that lets him extend his arms more. This would likely cost him some contact ability- but he has a 9% K rate this year due in part to surprising feel to hit- so there's lots of room for more whiffs before they become an issue.While currently athletic enough to stay at third- Bohm's broad frame is likely to add some weight over the next few years- and he may have to move down the defensive spectrum. This- plus an projected swing change- mean more of Bohm's profile exists in abstraction than is typical for this kind of college performer. The Phillies zeroed in on Bohm early in the spring and are the favorites to select him.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 35 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Coming into 2018- scouts were divided as to which of Wichita State's two potential first-round position players was better. Greyson Jenista has more all-around ability and won the Cape Cod League MVP award last summer- but Bohm posted better numbers there and does a better job of tapping into his considerable power potential. Bohm easily settled the argument with a superior junior season- thrusting himself into consideration as a top-five-overall pick.Bohm manages the strike zone very well and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't strike out as much as Jenista- has an edge in bat speed and his stroke is more geared to generate power at this point. He understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs- so he doesn't.  Bohm doesn't offer much when he's outside of the batter's box- however. Though he has worked diligently to improve at third base- he lacks quickness and range- his hands are just fair and his arm is only average. He'll probably wind up at first base but has the offensive upside to profile there.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/GOKNy9Trues?autoplay=1,|,2388,77,240,|,,,,PHI,3,,,,|,Wichita State,,Wichita State,Junior,|,STL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,35,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

He made it through his return season in 2016 healthy and was added to the 40-man roster- then turned in a career-high 125 innings in Double-A in 2017- though he ran out of gas in August and ended the year on the disabled list with a shoulder impingement.  Romero's outstanding stuff played very well in the Southern League and should allow him to continue to befuddle hitters at the highest levels. He can sit in the mid-90s with ease and reach back for 98-99 mph at times. His slider continued to sharpen the further removed from surgery he is and it will flash plus when his mechanics are good. His changeup should be an average pitch and the more he can throw it effectively- the better weapon it will be against left-handed hitters. While he's not a command artist- he'll throw enough strikes to be a successful starter.  The key for Romero now is to continue to build strength and show durability throughout a season.   Romero was understandably treated with kid gloves in 2016. Those gloves came off a bit in 2017- and with his injury behind him- Romero has the chance to reach his potential as a frontline starter. If he can do that and his stuff continues to improve- he could eventually pitch near the top of a rotation.,,,,,|,1031,72,215,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,J2 2011,Dominican Republic,Nov. 4- 2011 - MIN,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,40,,55,,,,40,70,45,,60,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,50,,55,,,,50

Then there have been smaller signings- like Graterol- who got just $150-000. After missing the 2016 season due to Tommy John surgery- Graterol had a breakout United States debut in 2017- finishing with a strong outing in the Appalachian League playoffs and putting him firmly on the prospect map.  Graterol has exciting raw stuff that was clearly too much for Rookie-level hitters. His fastball now sits at 95-98 mph and he can touch triple digits. He throws two distinct breaking balls and both are viable weapons- with his slider having the chance to be a wipe out plus pitch down the road. His changeup is behind those two secondary offerings- but he has a feel for it and it could be Major League average in time.  Graterol has definitely been control over command- with his pure stuff helping mask any issues in that regard at the lower levels. But the Twins are very encouraged with the strike-throwing strides he made in 2017 and feel he could climb the ranks as one of the better pitching prospects in baseball as he ascends through the organization.,,,,,|,2274,73,180,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,J2 2014,Venezuela,Aug. 29- 2014 - MIN,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,,50,,,,40,70,55,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,45,50,55,,,,50

The Dodgers selected him 65th overall- Santa Clara's highest pick since Randy Winn went in the same spot 21 years earlier- and signed him for a well below-slot $590-800. He advanced to Double-A in his first full pro season and might have progressed further had a broken toe not sidelined him for nearly two months.    When former Dodgers vice president of baseball operations (now Braves GM) Alex Anthopoulos saw him in Spring Training one day last year- he remarked that White had the type of stuff that would fit a No. 1 overall pick. His fastball sat around 90 mph at the start of 2016 but now operates at 92-97 mph and plays up with natural sink and run. That's not necessarily his best pitch because he also possesses a power slider with late bite that can reach 88 mph- and he also has the ability to morph it into an even harder and equally effective cutter.    White also has a curveball that can be a true hammer at times- and after focusing on his breaking pitches in 2017- he'll work to refine his changeup this year. He also needs to sharpen his control and command- and he has the athleticism and sound delivery to do so. He generates a ton of swings and misses as well as weak contact- with 61 percent of the batters he faced in his first two pro seasons either striking out or grounding out against him.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/-XlwJUJpdH0?autoplay=1,,|,1657,76,207,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,2nd rd 2016,Santa Clara,,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,60,,55,,,45,60,45,60,,60,,,55,|,,,,,,|,65,45,55,65,,,,50

He ranked third in hitting (.316) among Minor League catchers and earned another in-season promotion- moving to high Class A before he turned 19.    A switch-hitter- Ruiz has advanced feel for the barrel and a line-drive approach. He hits the ball with much more authority from the left side of the plate and slugged just .310 as a right-hander in 2017. Of his 11 homers in his first three pro seasons- six were in games in the final two months of last season- a sign that he's beginning to drive the ball more frequently and should develop at least double-digit home run power.

Perez generated little attention when he signed for $10-000 in December 2014 at the relatively advanced age of 18- but he's anonymous no longer now that he has developed some of the best stuff in the system. He made a successful jump to full-season ball in 2017- finishing by going 10-0 with a 2.24 ERA in his final 15 starts in low Class A (counting the playoffs).  Perez has added at least 40 pounds to his 6-foot-8 frame since signing- boosting his fastball from 90-93 mph in his pro debut to 93-97 mph with a peak of 99 last season. He carried his premium velocity throughout 2017- working at 96-99 mph in his South Atlantic League postseason start. His long arms create unusual angle and plane to his pitches- making it harder for hitters to contend with his heater.  Perez also has a curveball and changeup that show flashes of becoming plus pitches- and he has added a hard slider that also has promise. He made good progress last year with repeating his delivery and throwing strikes- no easy task for a 6-foot-8 delivery.

The Cubs- in need of pitching prospects and noting that he had one of the best fastball/curveball combinations available- still paid him $1.5 million in the sixth round despite knowing that he'd need Tommy John surgery. Chicago managed his comeback carefully before starting to take the reins off in 2017- then sent him to the White Sox in July as part of a four-prospect package for Jose Quintana.  Cease excels at missing bats- as his 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings last season (fourth-best in the Minors among pitchers who matched or exceeded his 93 1/3 innings) would attest. He can sit at 94-98 mph and reach 100 mph with his fastball- which also features some sink and run. His curveball isn't as reliable- but can be just as devastating when it's on- a true power hammer that has drawn comparisons to Dwight Gooden's.  Cease still has a lot of work to do in order to reach his upside as a frontline starter.

The Angels loved his upside and athleticism enough to take him in the second round of the 2016 Draft- but they had to wait to see him play until 2017 as a back issue was found in his post-Draft physical. The wait was worth it- as he was one of the more exciting players in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.

They still remained active and may have found a bargain when they landed Medina for $280-000 out of the Dominican Republic in July 2015. He began hitting 100 mph with his fastball shortly before he turned pro and now has the best pure stuff in the system.  Medina isn't physically imposing but has an exceptionally quick arm that repeatedly delivers 95-100 mph fastballs that top out at 102 and feature some cutting action. Both of his secondary pitches have a chance to be at least plus pitches as well. He has a power curveball with a high spin rate and a 90-92 mph changeup with splitter action that can devastate hitters- especially if they're trying to sit on his heater.  Medina is still young and extremely raw- so he'll need time to reach his lofty ceiling as a frontline starter. He's has yet to learn to tame his electric stuff- though New York believes he can develop at least average control and command because his delivery doesn't feature much effort. The Yankees are loaded with quality pitching prospects- and he could be the most successful of them if he can add some polish.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/CULpv2BOf-0?autoplay=1,,|,2226,73,175,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 8- 2015 - NYY,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,,55,,,,35,65,55,,60,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,75,55,60,,,,,45

He got pounded for a 6.42 ERA in his U.S. debut in 2015 but since has developed into one of the Dodgers' best pitching prospects while learning to harness quality stuff. He didn't look out of place in a loaded high Class A Rancho Cucamonga rotation alongside Walker Buehler- Mitchell White and Yadier Alvarez to start 2017 before pitching his way to Double-A at age 21.    Santana sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 98 with a fastball that features so much sink that it creates a lot of strikeouts and groundouts- but the life on his heater also makes it difficult for him to command. His hard slider gives him a second plus pitch at times- though he still must improve his changeup to give him a weapon against left-handers. He did make some strides with his changeup late last season.    Santana has a low arm slot and a crossfire delivery that also hamper his ability to throw strikes- and his walk rate jumped from 2.3 per nine innings in high Class A to 6.3 in Double-A. Los Angeles has moved him from the third-base side of the rubber to the first-base side in an attempt to get him more centered toward the plate. If he ultimately can't develop the control and command to make a big league rotation- he has closer upside if he's moved to the bullpen.,,,,,|,2022,74,160,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,March 12- 2013 - LAD,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,65,45,,55,,,,50

He was beset by injuries once again two years later- when he missed time with both elbow and shoulder pain- but got back on track in 2016 and finished second in the Class Midwest League in ERA (2.41) following a demotion from Class A Advanced Dunedin. He fared considerably better in 2017 during his return to the Florida State League- dominated over seven Double-A starts following a promotion in July and then put a bow on his breakout campaign by tossing six scoreless frames in his lone Triple-A start.   Borucki has a low-90s fastball that peaks at 95- with late movement that helps him generate ground balls. His plus changeup is the best in the system and plays nicely off his heater because he throws it with similar arm speed- in turn giving him a chance against right-handed hitters. Borucki's slider is less advanced than his changeup- with varying shape and pace- but it has the potential to be another Major League-average pitch. Despite missing parts of three seasons due to injury- Borucki has never lost his feel for pounding the zone with his entire arsenal- and he'll enter 2018 having issued just 2.2 walks-per-nine in his career.  Borucki answered questions about his health and durability by pitching 135 2/3 frames and making 26 starts in 2016- and he handled an even greater workload in '17- tossing 150 1/3 frames across three levels.

It's hard to argue with the results- as he went 28-6 with a 2.40 ERA and 279 strikeouts in 277 2/3 innings in 2016-17. He led the Triple-A International League in opponent average (.197) last season after topping the entire Minors (.169) the year before.  Adams worked at 92-94 mph with his fastball as a Dallas Baptist reliever- but now sits at 94 as a pro starter. His heater lacks life so he has to command it well to succeed and usually does. His slider has gotten faster and tighter in pro ball- and it's now a plus pitch in the mid-80s.  The key for Adams to reaching his upside as a No. 3 starter will be refining his changeup into a solid third offering. He also has a curveball that's his fourth-best pitch yet still qualifies as average. He lives on the corners and the bottom of the strike zone- making it difficult to square him up.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/If_SFx0CQxM?autoplay=1,,|,1853,73,220,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,5th rd 2015,Dallas Baptist,,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,45,50,,,,45,55,50,50,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,50,60,,,,50

ETA 2021,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  After the Twins took Kirilloff from the Pittsburgh area high school ranks in the middle of the first round of the 2015 Draft- he went out and won Appalachian League Player of the Year honors. A sore left elbow shut him down late that summer and led to Tommy John surgery the next spring- ending his first full season before it began.  Healthy again- Kirilloff can get back to showing off his outstanding hit tool from the left side of the plate. He has an innate ability to barrel up the baseball consistently and can drive it to all fields. There should be plenty of over-the-fence power as he matures- though he is more hit over power at present. Athletic for his size- Kirilloff played center field and pitched in high school- and he saw some time in center during his pro debut. That said- Kirilloff profiles best in right field. If his elbow doesn't come all the way back- he has shown he can play a solid first base defensively.  The Twins will finally get to see what Kirilloff can do over the course of a full season.

He was traded to the Braves a year after he signed in the Bronson Arroyo deal. In his first two years with Atlanta- he's shown glimpses of the raw stuff and athleticism that made him a first-rounder- as well as some of the reasons why he's been slow to progress.    Based on pure stuff- an argument can be made for Toussaint to be higher on this list. He has a plus fastball that can touch the upper 90s at times and one of the best curveballs in the system- a true hammer that misses a ton of bats when he lands it for strikes. His changeup has gotten better and should be a solid third weapon for him. Toussaint's overall performance was in many ways better once he got to Double-A in 2017- though his peripherals down a level were better than some of his stats would indicate. His strikeout rate went way up in 2017- but he still has a ways to go to find consistent command of his exciting stuff.    The Braves feel Toussaint grew more emotionally than perhaps any other starting pitching prospect in their system in 2017. He came to baseball- and pitching- a bit later than many- which might be a reason why adjustments have taken longer for him. He can get by with improper mechanics- but when he is in sync- he can dominate- and the Braves feel his athleticism will help him get there eventually- with a ceiling of a No. 2 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/qaR9D8rYrhY?autoplay=1,,|,726,75,185,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,1st rd 2014,Coral Springs Christian HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,65,,,,,40,60,60,65,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,65,50,60,,,,,45

The Pirates nabbed him at 12 and gave him $4.1 million- a bit over pick value- to sign him away from TCU- joining fellow Concordia product Ke'Bryan Hayes in the organization and making his brief pro debut in the Gulf Coast League.  Baz has a combination of deep repertoire and projection that gives him a very high ceiling. His fastball velocity picked up in his senior year. He'll sit at 92-96 mph and can reach back for 98 mph- with the ability to run and sink it while not losing velocity deep into his starts. He can miss bats with a plus cutter that he can turn into a true slider- and he also spins a distinctly different curveball. His changeup gives him another potential Major League average pitch. A solid athlete- Baz should be able to find the strike zone consistently as he refines his delivery.

He went 2-11 with a 5.42 ERA in low Class A during his first full pro season- allowing nine runs without recording an out in his final start.

He also can make hitters look bad with his pair of power breaking balls and his fading changeup but has had trouble getting ahead in the count to set up his secondary offerings.    The Rockies have toned down what was considerable effort in Pint's delivery- but he still has trouble repeating his mechanics and finding the strike zone. His first order of business is to locate his fastball more consistently- and then he can spend more time refining his other pitches.

He should move quickly and be in a big league rotation. His upside is a #3/4 starter.    Full Report:  Singer was a well-regarded prospect in high school who got results with an unusual delivery and low arm slot. The Blue Jays took him in the 2nd round. Negotiations broke down and Singer went to Florida where he was a standout from day one. There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: his stuff still isn't loud- he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters- his delivery turns off some scouts and his breaking ball is often fringy. Even scouts that like Singer think he has limited upside- but you can't argue with the results he has gotten in the SEC for several years and with his long track record of health. He has feel for pitching and a bulldog mentality- performing at the highest levels of amateur baseball. There's interest in Singer at multiple picks in the top 5- with Cincinnati at 5 the most rumored spot. He should move quickly and could be in a big league rotation in 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55    Singer has been able to pitch with such top college talent like A.J. Puk- the No. 6 overall pick in 2016- and Alex Faedo- who went No. 18 last June- at the University of Florida. After playing a pivotal role in helping the Gators win a national title- and pitching better than Faedo in many ways- it's now Singer's turn to be the Florida ace. At first it seemed like Singer would have the chance to be the No. 1 overall pick in the Draft- but a slow start to his junior season knocked him down a peg.    Singer checks off all of the boxes teams are looking for out of a potential top pick. Long and lean- he has a terrific pitcher's body that has thus far proven to be durable. He'll throw his fastball up to 95-96 mph consistently- with plus life. His slider plays well off of his fastball- a second above-average pitch he manipulates in terms of depth and velocity. His changeup continues to improve and should give him a third above-average offering. He commands the ball well- gets high marks for his makeup and is a plus competitor.    Both Puk and Faedo entered into their Draft seasons as potential 1-1 selections- but they didn't perform quite well enough to go in that top spot- and in some ways Singer followed suit. His stuff was bouncing back as the Draft approached- so don't expect him to slide too far down boards.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/zr81CO4HyzY?autoplay=1,|,1302,77,180,|,,,,KC,18,,,,|,Florida,,Florida,Junior,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,65,55,,60,,,,55

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 70 | Arm: 65 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  To call Jose Siri's 2017 season a breakout might be a bit of an understatement. Always blessed with tremendous raw tools- the outfielder started using them more consistently- finishing with a 20-40 season that placed him first in the Midwest League in stolen bases and second in home runs. He kept his hot bat going with a very strong showing in the Dominican Winter League- but then started the 2018 season on the disabled list after suffering ligament damage in his left thumb.    When Siri makes contact- it's loud- and he has the ability to drive the ball- and out of the park- to all fields. His power showed up more consistently in 2017- but whether he'll be able to get to it as he moves up will be dependent on his ability to refine his approach. His strikeout-to-walk ratio needs a lot of work as his aggressiveness at the plate leads to a lot of swings and misses and few free passes. He's a plus runner and then some- one who will continue to steal bases and cover a ton of ground in the outfield. He certainly can play center field long term and his cannon arm plays very well in right.    Siri might always be one of those super-aggressive hitters who succeeds because of his ridiculous tools and athleticism. But the abilty to improve his approach at the plate could allow him to become an impact- All-Star caliber player.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/O-dXckzAobc?autoplay=1,,|,2263,74,175,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,Sept. 21- 2012 - CIN,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,35,40,50,60,50,60,60,55,50,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,70,65,50,|,,,,,,,,

That's a big reason why Maitan was ranked No. 1 on MLB Pipeline's Top 30 international prospects list entering the 2016 July 2 signing period and why the Braves shelled out $4.25 million to sign him. Maitan was declared a free agent last November- however- as part of the penalty levied against the Braves for violation of baseball's rules on signing international amateur free agents. The Angels swooped in and signed Maitan for $2.2 million in December once he was eligible to join another organization.    The Venezuelan teenager had been compared to Miguel Sano and his ceiling has been put side-by-side with the likes of Miguel Cabrera and Chipper Jones- though a pedestrian pro debut in 2017 had cooled some evaluators' opinions of him. He has pop from both sides- with perhaps a touch more from the right side. While he's not a runner- he is agile and athletic in the field. He has a very strong arm and good instincts- and while most foresee a move to third in the future- he will continue to play shortstop for the Angels. There are some concerns regarding his conditioning- something he'll need to watch if he doesn't want to become a first base-only type- though he had shed some weight at instructs with the Braves last fall.    Wherever he plays defensively- Maitan has the combination of hitting tools and feel for the game to potentially develop into a future superstar in the middle of a lineup. He'll be just 18 for all of the 2018 season- so patience will be key.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0cx8ztyNO2A?autoplay=1,,|,1566,74,190,|,LAA,laa,ANA,,,J2 2016,Venezuela,Dec. 16- 2017 - LAA,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,55,30,40,60,50,55,60,40,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,40,65,45,|,,,,,,,,

Extremely mature for his age- the Dominican made his full-season debut last August at 18 and didn't look out of place in the low Class A Midwest League. While he may not have as high a ceiling as former top Cubs infield prospects Javy Baez- Addison Russell and Gleyber Torres- he still offers plenty of upside and has a high floor.  Ademan is an advanced hitter who already recognizes pitches- uses the whole field and doesn't try to do too much. He makes repeated contact- drilling line drives to all fields while managing the strike zone well. Though he lacks size- he has a quick left-handed swing and some sneaky power that could translate into 12-15 homers annually once he adds some muscle.  Ademan has average speed but plays quicker than that on the bases and in the field because of his instincts. He's still learning as a basestealer but already shows a propensity for making plays at shortstop. His hands- range and arm are all solid and should allow him to play a variety of positions if needed.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/O6qGFx-xdpQ?autoplay=1,,|,1089,71,160,|,CHC,chc,CHC,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - CHC,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,40,55,45,55,55,45,45,50,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,50,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

A Cuban defector who cost Los Angeles a $16 million bonus and a matching amount in tax- he had a reputation for wildness but showed a surprising amount of polish in his 2016 pro debut. Control woes reappeared last season when the Dodgers promoted him aggressively- yet he was overpowering when he found the strike zone.    Few pitchers can match Alvarez's combination of athleticism and arm speed- which allows him to sit at 94-97 mph into the late innings and reach 101 mph with life on his fastball while exerting little effort. However- his heater can get hit hard when he can't locate it down in the strike zone. Similarly- his upper-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch but also can be ineffective when he can't get it over the plate.    Alvarez's struggled even more in 2017 with his changeup- which was too firm to throw hitters off balance. He also has messed around with a hard curveball- though refining his slider is a greater priority. If he can't deliver more strikes after his walk rate jumped from 3.2 per nine innings in 2016 to 4.9 last year- his projection will change from frontline starter to high-leverage reliever.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/GPeREXyoEzQ?autoplay=1,,|,1067,75,175,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,J2 2015,Cuba,July 2- 2015 - LAD,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,40,50,,,,30,70,50,45,60,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,40,,60,,,,45

The hard-throwing right-hander logged eight appearances out of the Cardinals' bullpen down the stretch and then made strides in the Arizona Fall League as a starter before going to the Marlins with Magneuris Sierra- Zac Gallen and Daniel Castano for Marcell Ozuna in December.  Alcantara's velocity has increased in the last two years as he's added good strength to his tall and wiry frame. He'll frequently touch triple digits with his fastball and sits consistently in the 95-99 mph range with late movement. He features a pair of breaking balls in a fringy curveball and a hard- mid-80s slider that is an above-average- swing-and-miss pitch at its best. Alcantara also will show flashes with an 88-91 mph changeup- a potentially average-or-better offering that plays up due to his fast arm but is lacking in overall consistency.  Alcantara's control and command both leave much to be desired- but as he keeps adding velocity- he's still learning to harness his stuff. While pinpoint command won't be ever be necessary given his dynamic repertoire- he'll need to pitch down in the zone consistently to be effective as a starter. At the least- Alcantara has the weapons to become a dominant closer at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/O4yyOfElw3Y?autoplay=1,,|,1459,76,170,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2013 - STL,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,45,45,40,,,,30,70,60,50,45,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,55,45,55,,,,45

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    Allen pitched for IMG Academy's (Fla.) high school squad as a senior before going to the Red Sox in the eighth round of the 2015 Draft and signing for $725-000. After a solid pro debut- he was one of four players shipped to the Padres as part of the Craig Kimbrel trade in November. Allen was bothered by left elbow soreness the following year- limiting his time on the mound- but a healthy campaign allowed him to begin moving through the Minors in 2017- as Allen finished the season as a 20-year-old in the Class A Advanced California League.    After pitching with a below-average fastball at the outset of his career- Allen now operates more in the 92-94 mph range with late life- though his velocity can fluctuate at times. He's aggressive with his fastball location- too- with a willingness to attack right-handed hitters on the inner half of the plate. A changeup and a curveball comprise Allen's secondary arsenal. The former is well ahead of the latter- at times flashing plus- though his breaking ball stands to improve once he learns to better repeat his release point.    Allen's pitchability and knack for pounding the zone with his three-pitch mix should aid him as he continues his trek through the Padres' system. Health and durability are still concerns with the physically mature left-hander- but he did his part to assuage them in 2017 by tossing a career-high 125 innings- more than double his workload from the previous year.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/vO-q9WIphiY?autoplay=1,,|,1549,75,200,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,8th rd 2015,IMG Academy HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,SD,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,50,,,,,40,50,60,50,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,60,50,,,,,50

He strained his elbow shortly after signing and Texas handled him with care- so he totaled just 181 2/3 innings during his first four pro seasons. He broke out in 2016- jumping from Class A Advanced to the big leagues- and received another September callup in 2017.  Mendez owns one of the best changeups in the Minors- with fade- sink and deception that add up to a well above-average pitch at its best. He relies on it almost too heavily at the expense of his other pitches- so the Rangers restricted his use of it last year so he could focus on the rest of his repertoire. He has good feel for his 90-95 mph sinker- but not as much for his pair of fringy breaking balls- with his slider more reliable than his curveball.  Though he's still not very physical- Mendez has proven his durability during the last two seasons. He doesn't have a huge margin for error- but does a good job of throwing strikes and working down in the zone. His ability to come up with a solid breaking pitch will determine whether he becomes a No. 3 starter or settles in toward the back of a rotation.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ftXWbnqqZ5o?autoplay=1,,|,1101,77,200,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,J2 2011,Venezuela,July 2- 2011 - TEX,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,45,45,,,,45,55,60,45,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,60,45,45,,,,55

ETA late 2019.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 70 | Overall: 50  White has an unusual profile. He bats right-handed and throws left-handed- he's as athletic as it comes among first basemen and -- unheard of at his position -- his power might be weakest among all of his tools. After producing consistently at the plate while making year-to-year improvements throughout three seasons at Kentucky- White- a USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award semifinalist- joined Chad Green (Brewers- 1996) as the only Wildcats position players ever to get drafted in the first round.  White manages the strike zone well and usually focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap with a relatively flat swing. He has good bat speed and a long frame built to create leverage- so power should come once he adds more strength to his body and more loft to his swing. Meanwhile- the fact that he turned on more pitches last spring at Kentucky en route to a career-best 10 home runs -- he combined for seven homers during his freshman and sophomore seasons -- bodes very well for his future.  A plus runner with solid arm strength- White proved a very capable corner outfielder with the U.S. college national team in 2016. The Mariners- however- will deploy him exclusively at first base- where has has the potential to become a Gold Glove defender.

Signed for $2-003-400 as the 30th overall pick in 2016- he topped the short-season Northwest League in strikeouts (87) last summer and easily would have led in strikeout rate (13.7 per nine innings) if he had enough innings to qualify. His encore will be delayed until 2019- however- because he was diagnosed with an elbow injury during Spring Training that required Tommy John surgery.  Ragans' fastball sits in the low 90s and peaks at 95 mph- but it plays as a plus pitch because it features a high spin rate that creates riding life and he also hides it well. He added some velocity during his first full year of pro ball and could pick up more as he continues to strengthen his lean frame. His changeup is similarly effective and his downer curveball should become a solid third pitch once it develops more power.  Ragans has sound mechanics and employs a high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. Though he's athletic and repeats his delivery- his control and command are still works in progress. He walked 5.7 batters per nine innings in his first two pro seasons- and if he can pound the strike zone more efficiently once he returns to health- he could become a No. 2 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/9643WDWjlw0?autoplay=1,,|,1593,76,190,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,1st rd 2016,North Florida Christian HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,60,40,,,,,40,50,65,50,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,60,55,,,,,45

The Cardinals- with a strong track record of finding college talent in the later rounds- nabbed Knizner in the seventh round of the 2016 Draft- and he promptly double-jumped from A ball to Double-A over the course of his first full season. He then capped things off with a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League.    In his short time as a pro- Knizner has shown a knack for barreling up the baseball- making consistent hard contact to all fields. An aggressive hitter from the right side of the plate- he doesn't walk much- but he also doesn't strike out. His power will be the last tool to come for him- but he's already showing some over-the-fence pop.

He has solid average hands and he's continuing to learn the nuances of game-calling.    Knizner didn't disappoint in handling the challenge of the double-jump to Double-A while still learning his craft as a backstop- seriously upgrading his prospect profile.

Since signing for $1-495-000- he thrived as a youngster in tough pitching environments in each of his first three pro seasons. The youngest ERA qualifier in the California League by nearly a year at age 20 in 2017- he ranked fourth in the Class A Advanced circuit at 4.17 despite pitching in Lancaster- possibly the best hitter's park in the Minors.  Lambert shows the potential for four pitches that could be at least solid. His fastball sits at 91-93 mph and peaks at 96- and he keeps it off barrels with sink- angle and very good command. His tumbling changeup may be his most consistent plus pitch- though his low-80s curveball can be even better than that at times.  Last year- Lambert added a slider that can reach the mid-80s and continues to improve as he throws it more. He repeats his clean delivery with efficiency and uses his high three-quarters arm slot to pound the bottom of the strike zone. He looks like a future No. 3 starter and perhaps more if he can get stronger and add more velocity.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/bglOnR4sPGk?autoplay=1,,|,1281,74,185,|,COL,col,COL,,,2nd rd 2015,San Dimas HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,50,45,,,,45,50,60,55,50,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,55,60,55,50,,,,55

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 60 | Run: 40 | Arm: 60 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Chavis established himself as one of the best power hitters in the 2014 Draft- winning the home run derby at the Perfect Game All-American Classic the previous summer before batting .580 with 13 homers in 28 games as a high school senior. He had only sporadic success in his first three seasons after signing for $1-870-500 as the 26th overall pick- however- batting .235/.301/.396 with a 27 percent strikeout rate. Then a change in approach led to a breakout 2017- when he finished third in the Minors in extra-base hits (68) and fifth in homers (31) while reaching Double-A. Chavis began the 2018 season on Portland's DL after straining his oblique in February- then was slapped with an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.  The key for Chavis was understanding that he doesn't have to swing for the fences and that his bat speed- strength and loft in his right-handed swing will create plenty of natural power. He stopped trying to pull every pitch he saw out of the park and did a better job of recognizing pitches and adopting a two-strike approach. He cut his strikeout rate to 22 percent last year but still may not show enough patience to hit for a high average against quality pitching.  Chavis broke into pro ball as a shortstop before moving to third base in instructional league following his pro debut. While his below-average speed limits his range- he has a strong arm and has worked hard to become an acceptable defender at the hot corner. Blocked by Rafael Devers in Boston- he began playing some first base late last season and in the Arizona Fall League- and some scouts wonder if he could become a second baseman in the Jedd Gyorko mold.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/eaAbGhTyWvg?autoplay=1,,|,811,70,216,|,BOS,bos,BOS,,,1st rd 2014,Sprayberry HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,30,50,65,40,40,55,40,60,65,40,45,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,60,40,60,45,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2022.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50    A star for Team USA during the 2015 18U World Cup in Japan- Garrett continued to boost his Draft stock the following spring with a dominant senior year. It all led to Garrett becoming the highest-drafted Alabama prep since 1971 (Condredge Holloway- fourth overall) as Miami selected him with the seventh-overall pick in June and signed him away from a Vanderbilt commitment with an above-slot bonus. After having his pro debut pushed back until 2017- Garrett would make just four starts for Class A Greensboro before undergoing Tommy John surgery in June.    Garrett's curveball has drawn raves from scouts- many of whom considered it to be among the best in his Draft class. It's a true plus offering when Garrett is healthy- thrown at 76-80 mph with tight spin and great depth- and he demonstrates feel for moving it in and out of the zone as needed. Garrett creates good plane and pounds the zone with his 90-94 mph fastball- and it's easy to envision a bit more velocity in his future as he matures physically. His changeup- once fully developed- should serve as a third above-average-or-better offering- all of which stand to play up thanks to his advanced command.    Garrett started the year on the disabled list- but the Marlins are hopeful he will pitch in games sometime late in the 2018 season. However- any setback along the way has the potential to delay his return until the following year. Assuming he returns fully healthy- Garrett possesses a No. 2-starter ceiling- with a mature arsenal and strong command profile that also give him a relatively high floor.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/m1S8r6P_0gU?autoplay=1,,|,1706,75,190,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,1st rd 2016,Florence HS (AL),,|,,,,,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,55,,,,,45,50,55,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,55,55,60,,,,,55

He made up for some of that lost time with a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League and then broke out in earnest in 2017- when he batted .323/.400/.484 across three levels including Triple-A. Fearing he might be taken in the Rule 5 Draft- Toronto added Jansen to its 40-man roster after the season.  That Jansen makes a lot of contact- understands the strike zone and recognizes pitches well highlights his upside as an offensive-oriented catcher who also adds value with his on-base kills. His combination of bat speed and physical strength yields sneaky power to his pull side- which is to where Jansen hit nine of his career-high 10 home runs in 2017. Behind the plate- Jansen has made impressive strides in his blocking- receiving and framing since signing- although his catch-and-throw skills may never be better than average.  Developing high school catchers tends to take time- and that's certainly been the case with Jansen. His solid tools on both sides of the ball- as well as his capacity to make adjustments- portends to a career as at least a big league backup if he can stay healthy.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/4lbMDzv8Er4?autoplay=1,,|,1183,74,225,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,16th rd 2013,West HS (WI),,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,50,30,50,30,45,55,60,45,50,30,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,30,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 45 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  The Orioles knew they were getting a potentially special hitter when they selected Mountcastle with their second of two first round picks in 2015. He's proved to be that early in his career- showing a combination of pure hitting ability and power that earned him a promotion to Double-A at age 20 in 2017 before a successful turn in the Arizona Fall League. Mountcastle's 2018 debut was delayed by a fractured right hand.  Mountcastle boasts a quick bat and does an outstanding job of keeping his hands inside the ball so as to create extension through the zone and generate backspin to all fields. An advanced approach and good pitch recognition further fuel Mountcastle's projection as an above-average hitter- and scouts are equally high on his power potential after he piled up 67 extra-base hits- including 18 home runs and a Minor League-best 48 doubles- in his second full season.  The move up to Double-A brought a position change for Mountcastle as the Orioles shifted from shortstop to third base. He showed in the AFL that his below-average arm strength plays better at the hot corner than it did at short- though some scouts believe he'll ultimately end up further down the defensive spectrum. Regardless of his position- it will be Mountcastle's bat that helps him carve out a career as an impactful regular.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf-E2t1dIxo?autoplay=1,,|,1325,75,195,|,BAL,bal,BAL,,,1st rd 2015,Hagerty HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,40,35,50,40,30,30,55,50,55,40,40,30,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,50,45,45,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Larnach hits low-lying lasers- with several balls off the bat in excess of 115mph during Oregon State's opening weekend in Arizona. If sneaky plus-plus raw power exists- Larnach has it- as he generates it without taking max-effort hacks. There are teams that don't like Larnach in this range because they think he's a bad defender and/or they are concerned about his 20% strikeout rate- But Larnach's career 15% walk rate should help satiate the stat-driven people in draft rooms and his power numbers could take a jump if pro instruction coaxes more lift out of his swing. He checks every box for the risk-averse- analytics-driven clubs- which means he has a lot of potential homes in the 10-20 range.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  When a key player in the lineup goes down with an injury- the hope is others will step up to pick up the slack. With Nick Madrigal on the shelf for a good chunk of Oregon State's season- Larnach did just that. Following up a strong Cape Cod League season last summer- the outfielder has added power to his game to greatly raise his Draft profile.  Larnach has been known for his advanced approach from the left side of the plate since stepping into the Beavers' starting lineup as a sophomore. He's not afraid to draw walks and makes consistent hard contact- always loving using the opposite field. Evaluators have thought there was power to tap into and he's done that this spring- reaching double-digit home runs. With a tick above-average arm- there's a chance Larnach could play right- though a lack of speed makes most feel left field is his likely long-term defensive home.  Regardless of which outfield corner he plays- it's looking more and more like Larnach's bat will fit the profile just fine. College hitters who perform- especially for elite programs- tend to climb boards as the Draft approaches and Larnach's name was creeping into first-round conversations.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/U7sjFBR3DkI?autoplay=1,|,2405,76,205,|,,,,MIN,20,,,,|,Oregon State,,Oregon State,Junior,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,40,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

He started to draw attention with his high-octane fastball after making his U.S. debut in 2014- though minor physical issues sidelined him that year and in the next two. Fully healthy in 2017- he worked a career-high 133 innings and advanced to Triple-A.  Acevedo's fastball has been clocked as high as 103 mph- though he usually works from 93-97 mph as a starter- which is even tougher to hit because of the funkiness and angle his 6-foot-7 frame and low three-quarters arm slot create. That slot makes it tough for him to stay on top of his mid-80s slider- which may never be more than an average offering. He compensates with a plus changeup that he locates well and is effective against both left-handers and right-handers.  For an extra-large guy with a lot of velocity- Acevedo throws a surprising amount of strikes. His delivery isn't smooth and features effort- yet he somehow makes it work and finally proved he could hold up over a full season in 2017. Some scouts aren't convinced he'll hold up for a starter- though he'd still have plenty of value as a high-leverage option should he become a reliever.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/3yyTjdYwHiE?autoplay=1,,|,1437,79,250,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,Oct. 17- 2012 - NYY,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,,45,,,,45,60,55,,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,60,,50,,,,55

He did finish strongly and dominated in the College World Series shortly after the Tigers feel he dropped in their lap at No. 18 overall in the June Draft. He didn't pitch after signing as Detroit erred on the side of caution.    By the end of his final season with Florida- Faedo was back to full strength- featuring his plus fastball and one of the best sliders in the class. He'll sit around 93 mph and touch 95 regularly with good sink. He threw his slider too much in college- but it is a true out pitch that gets a lot of swings and misses. He'll flash a very good changeup- something he'll have to throw more often as a pro. He generally throws strikes- though it's more control than command right now.    Even though the Tigers went slightly over pick value to sign Faedo- he could prove to be a first-round bargain- a top-of-the-Draft talent found in the middle of the round. His Gators teammate A.J.

He has no physical projection- a very short stride- was subject to irregular usage this spring.    Full Report:  Weathers is the son of former big league reliever David Weathers and has been a known prospect of interest since his sophomore year of high school. Though he's not built like most prep prospects- Weathers is remarkably athletic and a dynamite high school basketball player. His stuff has waxed and waned this spring- but when it's good- Weathers has arguably the best present three-pitch mix and pitch usage in the class. He's a short-strider- so the fastball is going to play down a bit due to poor extension- but otherwise he projects as a mid-rotation arm due to the quality of his secondaries- and is- potentially- a quick-moving one. He's in play as early as pick #7- then there seems to be a gap before his name starts coming up again in the late teens and early twenties. ,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55  Loretto (Tenn.) High produced Johhny Jones- the No. 5 overall pick in the 1967 Draft- and David Weathers- who pitched 19 years in the Majors. Weathers' son Ryan has the potential to be better than both of them as a lefty with the pitches and polish to work in the front half of a big league rotation. He set a Tennessee high school tournament record with 28 strikeouts last spring- including 12 in a shutout in the Class A championship game- and turned in two scoreless outings for Team USA as it won the 18-and-under World Cup in September.  While Weathers lacks a true out pitch- he has three solid offerings and mixes them well. His fastball sits at 90-93 mph and tops out at 95- playing above its velocity with a high spin rate that gives it deceptive riding life. His upper-70s curveball usually features good depth and he possesses an advanced changeup for a teenager.  Weathers has a sound delivery and repeats it well- throwing strikes with ease. He's a good athlete who does the little things well and could contribute as a two-way player at Vanderbilt if he doesn't turn pro. He gets his athleticism from both sides of his family- as his mother- Kelli Davis Weathers- was an All-America basketball player at Belmont.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/_NYKyhaRURs?autoplay=1,|,2393,74,210,|,,,,SD,7,,,,|,Loretto HS TN,Vanderbilt,Loretto (Tenn.)

Diaz broke out at age 20 in his full-season debut the following year- ranking among the Midwest League leaders with 20 home runs (first)- 72 walks (second)- 75 RBIs (third) and a .469 slugging (fourth) en route to Milwaukee's Minor League player of the year award. Although he didn't fare as well with a move to the Carolina League in 2017- Diaz did continue to showcase a promising blend of power and on-base skills before a fractured right hamate prematurely ended his season- and he joined the Marlins this offseason when he was included in the trade package for Christian Yelich in January.   Diaz stands out for his plus raw power to all fields from the left side of the plate- a product of his plus bat speed- knack for finding the barrel and violent- upper-cut swing. The line-to-line approach Diaz showed during his first full season became more pull-oriented in 2017. That- along with his aggressive approach- ultimately detracted from Diaz's average and resulted in an elevated strikeout rate (26.6 percent)- though he still managed to register a career-best walk rate (13.6 percent).  Primarily a shortstop to begin his career- Diaz received the bulk of his Carolina League playing time at second base- where his fringy speed- range and hands all are cleaner fits. He has gains to make on both sides of the ball- but the foundation is there for Diaz to develop into an impactful- power-hitting second baseman.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/EmFvDmq5VBs?autoplay=1,,|,911,70,185,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,2nd rd 2014,Springfield HS (MA),,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,60,50,45,55,40,60,60,45,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,50,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50  Pratto has a long history of starring in international play- hitting a walk-off single to beat Japan in the 2011 Little League World Series- defeating Japan as a starting pitcher to help the United States win the 2015 18-and-under World Cup and starring again for Team USA to capture a gold medal at the 2016 18-and-under Pan Am Championships. One of a number of legitimate two-way prospects in the 2017 Draft- he drew interest as a pitcher until it became clear that he might be the best pure prep hitter available. He joined Eric Hosmer as the only first basemen ever taken in the first round by the Royals- signing for $3-450-000 as the 14th overall selection.  Though Pratto slumped at the end of his high school senior season and had a so-so pro debut- that hasn't stopped scouts from comparing him to Joey Votto and Brendan McKay (the No. 4 overall pick in 2017). Like them- Pratto is a hit-over-power first baseman who bats left-handed and has a mature approach at the plate. He has a pretty swing with plenty of bat speed- has an affinity for using the entire field and is beginning to tap into his considerable raw power.  Pratto is a better athlete than most first basemen. He's a potential Gold Glover who moves well around the bag and has a stronger arm than most players at his position. On the mound- he was very similar to McKay at the same stage of their careers- displaying an upper-80s fastball- promising secondary pitches and advanced feel.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/m12VQ7FD72k?autoplay=1,,|,2082,73,195,|,KCR,kc,KC,,,1st rd 2017,Huntington Beach HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,25,30,55,40,40,60,60,60,60,40,60,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,40,55,60,|,,,,,,,,

After capturing Midwest League All-Star honors with Class A Lake County during his full-season debut- Castro broke out in earnest at age 20 in 2017- when he ranked among the Class A Advanced Carolina League leaders in hits (second)- batting average (fourth) and runs scored (sixth). Following the season- the Indians added Castro to their 40-man roster.    A dynamic switch-hitter who produced nearly equal splits in 2017- Castro projects for an above-average bat thanks to his innate barrel skills and his knack for generating hard- line-drive contact from both sides of the plate. While his approach continues to be highly aggressive- Castro did make strides on that front last season by improving both his strikeout and walk rates. He began to show some game power- too- hitting a career-best 11 home runs to surpass his combined total of 10 from his first three seasons- and he continued to offer value on the basepaths with his above-average speed.     Loose and athletic on the infield- Castro has the necessary soft hands- actions and arm strength to stick at shortstop. His overall consistency leaves something to be desired after consecutive 25-error seasons- though club officials do expect him to improve defensively as he adds strength to his frame and learns to better control his body.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgzLpSZfVEw?autoplay=1,,|,1672,73,165,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2013 - CLE,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,40,20,45,55,55,50,55,45,45,55,60,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,55,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

After a strong summer debut- Hayes was limited by a fractured rib during his full-season debut in 2016. A move to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in 2017 at age 20 didn't faze him at all.  Hayes continues to refine his advanced approach as he moves up the ladder- gaining strength and adding speed as he goes. In 2017- his walk rate went up and his strikeout rate went down as his contact-oriented philosophy worked for him. He can drive the ball to all fields and while there wasn't much power in the pitching-friendly FSL- scouts feel it will come as he continues to mature. As Hayes has gotten into better shape- he's become a much better baserunner- finishing among the league leaders in stolen bases in 2017. He's always been a gifted defender- but the added agility has led to more range and made him even stronger at the hot corner.  The upper levels of the Pirates' system should provide a good challenge for Hayes- who will play all of 2018 at age 21. There's more potential to unlock here with Hayes growing into an upper-echelon third baseman a distinct possibility.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VAR1hcC2Clk?autoplay=1,,|,1140,73,210,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,1st rd 2015,Concordia Lutheran (TX),,|,,,,,|,NYM,0.500,XXX,|,40,30,45,60,45,60,55,40,50,55,60,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,55,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Hankins was the consensus top prep arm in the class this summer- dominating hitters and peaking with Team USA in the fall. At that point- Hankins was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater- a new- but already plus slider and at least and average changeup that he didn't need much. He came out of the gates this spring a little rusty then walked off the mound with shoulder tightness tied to a muscle behind the joint. He returned over a month later and has been good down the stretch- peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer- as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games this spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt- but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for the pitch anymore.The curveball that replaced it is similar to Brady Singer's curveball and is often a 45 or 50- maybe a 55 once a start but not often enough to project it as such. He's healthy- teams are clearing his medical and the arm speed is back- but his frame is now maxed-out and it's unclear where his breaking ball went and if it will come back. He's seen as very signable and the team that takes him will be banking on him returning to form; we've assumed there's a little more slider feel that will be teased out but not the 60 pitch of the summer.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Hankins made himself a candidate to become the first high school right-hander to go No. 1 overall in the Draft with an outstanding summer on the showcase circuit- finishing by striking out 27 in a pair of six-inning starts to help Team USA win the 18-and-under World Cup. He hasn't been the same pitcher this spring- however- leaving a mid-February start early due to shoulder tightness- an issue that was determined to be muscular but affected his stuff when he returned after a month-long layoff. He has become a total wild card as to where he fits in the Draft- and teams have to gauge his signability because he's part of a loaded Vanderbilt recruiting class that also includes fellow Georgia standouts Kumar Rocker and Will Banfield.  When he's 100 percent- Hankins has the best fastball in the 2018 Draft- sitting at 92-96 mph and reaching 98 mph with the promise of more velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-6 frame. Radar-gun readings alone don't make his heater special- as it also has electric life and he can spot it to both sides of the plate- and he could dominate amateur hitters while relying almost entirely on his fastball if he wanted. But there also have been times this spring where his fastball has parked around 90 mph with less movement than usual.  Hankins also has a fading changeup that has the makings of a plus pitch- though he'll need to come up with a reliable breaking pitch to become a front-of-the-rotation starter. His hard curveball showed improvement during the summer and he also began trying a slider- though neither has been very impressive this spring. He repeats his low-effort delivery well and will vary its tempo- at times adding a Johnny Cueto-esque shimmy to add deception.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LrEeDHttijE?autoplay=1,|,2399,78,200,|,,,,CLE,35,,,,|,Forsyth Central HS GA,Vanderbilt,Forsyth Central (Ga.)

Along with mental lapses and low energy- scouts are unsure how to project him.    Full Report:  As an underclassman- Turang looked like he might be the best prospect on a Southern California Area Code team that included Hunter Greene- Nick Allen- Jeremiah Estrada- Hans Crouse and several other excellent prospects. His balletic actions at shortstop and plus arm and athleticism gave Turang a stable floor- while his precocious feel to hit (he struck out just twice as a junior) and chance to grow into power made him a potential star. Turang looked like the best player in the class until last summer when he suddenly looked lethargic and uncomfortable at the plate. He's been better this spring- but not so great that concerns about his developmental direction have been quelled. Teams who value several years of performance are likely to value Turang more highly- and he should be off the board anywhere between the mid-teens and early twenties.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50    Turang entered last summer as perhaps the top player in the entire class- and certainly among the high school set. A combination of a relatively pedestrian summer showcase performances and an extremely high expectation bar- a trend that has continued this spring- caused his star to fade- though he's still one of the better prep players in the nation.    Turang does everything fairly well- though a lack of a true plus carrying tool is one reason why scouts were a bit down on him. Most feel he has the chance to be a plus hitter with an advanced approach at the plate using a high-contact- line-drive spray kind of approach. With a lean frame- there is some question about how much strength he'll add- with believers thinking power will come. Most feel he is a long-term shortstop- though some don't see it as a slam dunk.     Some feel Turang suffered more from being seen for so long that he was bound to get knocked simply for not being the best player on the field at all times. Others haven't seen him dominate the way they feel a top-of-the-Draft prospect should in high school. He is committed to LSU- which could become an issue depending on when he's selected.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ImTzgRayiHA?autoplay=1,|,2404,73,165,|,,,,MIL,21,,,,|,Santiago HS CA,LSU,Santiago (Calif.)

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 45 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Fedde was on his way toward becoming a top pick in the 2014 Draft before Tommy John surgery in May wiped out much of his junior campaign at UNLV. The injury didn't stop the Nationals from selecting him with the No. 18 overall pick in June- and Fedde rewarded the organization by reaching Double-A two years later in his first fully healthy season. Fedde continued to climb the ladder in 2017 en route to making his big league debut in July- though his season as a whole was inconsistent as the Nationals shuffled him between the starting rotation and bullpen.   The low-90s fastball with late life that Fedde shows as a starter plays up out of the bullpen- where he's capable of bumping the mid-90s with relative ease. His slider remains a plus offering- thrown in the low 80s with enough depth and tilt to consistently miss bats- and he completes his four-pitch mix with a below-average curveball and a changeup for which he demonstrated improved feel in 2017. Fedde also stands out for his pitchability- strike-throwing ability and knack for generating ground balls.   The Nationals' decision to shift Fedde to a relief role largely was a product of the club's ineffective big league bullpen. While he could still be used in such a role moving forward- Fedde's true value lies in his potential as a mid-rotation starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/GYCZJzLWfyA?autoplay=1,,|,816,76,195,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,1st rd 2014,UNLV,,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,55,40,,,,50,55,50,55,45,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,50,45,60,,,,55

Haseley uses the entire field and while he often featured more of an inside-out swing from the left side- he did start to show more power during his junior season. While not a burner- Haseley does have above-average speed. He is capable of playing center field- but whether that's his long-term home remains to be seen.

The fourth-rounder went on to have a solid pro debut with the Phillies- then saw all of his stuff tick up as he pitched across two levels of Class A ball during his first full season.  Romero looked more like a pure pitchability lefty coming out of Yavapai- but his improved stuff- along with his command- make him a much better pitching prospect overall. His four-seam fastball was up to 95 mph all year- including his final start of 2017 against Blue Jays super-prospects Vladimir Guerrero Jr and Bo Bichette- while his sinking 90-93 mph two-seamer generates a lot of weak contact on the ground. Depending on the report- he has as many as four secondary pitches. His changeup and cutter have the chance to be plus pitches- while he has a distinct average slider that is a bit ahead of his curveball. He fills the strike zone with all of them consistently.  While he's not the biggest guy in the world- Romero is very athletic and strong and has already shown to be very durable.

Those off-the-field issues didn't scare away the Nationals- who signed Romero for $2.8 million after taking him with the No. 25 overall pick.  A physically strong left-hander- Romero has feel for locating a fastball that can bump up to 97 mph and consistently sits 92-95. His plus slider in the low 80s is a legitimate swing-and-miss offering that nets him strikeouts on both sides of the plate- while Romero's changeup- much improved in 2017- has the makings of becoming an above-average third offering. Romero will miss bats with all three pitches when he's on- all while showing average control and command.   That Romero has a thicker build as well as some effort to his delivery gives some evaluators pause in projecting him as a starter long term.

In his first full pro season- he led the Minors with 113 runs while ranking fourth with 51 steals and fifth with 12 triples. He's on course to become the fifth Long Beach State shortstop to reach this big leagues this millennium- following Bobby Crosby- Troy Tulowitzki- Danny Espinosa and Matt Duffy.    Hampson's well above-average speed is his standout tool and he employs it well. After hitting too many routine fly-balls in college- he has adjusted his approach to put more balls on the ground and use his feet to get on base- where he had 87 steals in 105 attempts during his first two seasons. He has a quick right-handed swing and barrels the ball consistently- and while he doesn't offer much power- he does show good patience at the plate.    After spending his pro debut at shortstop- Hampson split time between second base and short in 2017. While his actions- range- hands and internal clock work at both spots- his average arm is a better fit at second. He shows Gold Glove upside at second base as he continues to learn the position.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/dAUevwXdsms?autoplay=1,,|,1766,71,185,|,COL,col,COL,,,3rd rd 2016,Long Beach State,,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,40,30,40,70,45,50,55,35,40,70,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,30,65,50,60,|,,,,,,,,

He also homered more than he struck out and finished sixth all-time on the Cavaliers' career home run list and second on their RBI list. That was more than enough for the Golden Spikes Award finalist to go No. 7 overall to the D-backs. His .318 average during his pro debut was good for third best in the Northwest League- though he didn't show over-the-fence power.  Smith carried his advanced approach at the plate with him to the pro ranks and finished with more walks than strikeouts in the Northwest League as well. Smith rarely swings and misses and drives the ball to all fields well from the left side of the plate. While he didn't homer until the end of the postseason- most feel it will come when he learns to turn on balls in good counts. Smith is limited to first base because of his below-average speed- but he's a capable defender with a solid arm there.  The kind of advanced hitter who should be able to move quickly- Smith's power will have to start showing up for him to fully fit the first-base profile.

The right-hander had already reached Double-A as a 20 year old in 2016 when the Brewers acquired him and Lewis Brinson in the Jonathan Lucroy-Jeremy Jeffress Trade Deadline blockbuster. He finished the season with Double-A Biloxi and then returned there in 2017 to have his longest and most complete campaign to date despite missing time with a hamstring injury in June.   A big and physical right-hander- Ortiz's combines stuff and feel better than most young pitchers. His strong build allows him to maintain his 92-97 mph fastball deep into ballgames- and his late-breaking slider in the low 80s gives him a second plus second pitch. Ortiz threw his changeup sparingly as an amateur- but has developed it enough as a pro to where scouts view it as a potentially average pitch. He also mixes in a below-average curveball to give hitters a different look. Meanwhile- a clean and repeatable delivery has helped to make Ortiz an accomplished strike-thrower early in his career- though some evaluators would like to see him spend less time in the zone   That Ortiz lacks projection to his mature- 6-foot-3 frame means that he will need to remain aggressive in his conditioning -- something he has done so far. Another healthy campaign will be key for Ortiz as he continues down his path towards becoming a No. 3 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bc-6cJ0VFrQ?autoplay=1,,|,715,75,230,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,1st rd 2014,Sanger HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,45,60,,,,50,60,50,50,60,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,50,45,60,,,,50

ETA late 2019.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  Undrafted out of Shiloh (Ga.) High in 2013- Lewis nearly captured the Southern Conference Triple Crown as a Mercer sophomore before starring in the prestigious Cape Cod League. He built on that success in 2016- garnering his second straight SoCon player of the year award as well as the prestigious Golden Spikes Award after batting a robust .395/.535/.731 with 20 home runs. The Mariners took Lewis with the 11th overall pick that June- and he signed for slot value at $3-286-700 two days later. Unfortunately- surgery to repair a torn ACL (as well as the medial and lateral meniscuses) in Lewis' right knee- an injury that he suffered during a home-plate collision prematurely ended his pro debut and then delayed the start of his 2017 campaign until June. When he finally returned to the field- Lewis aggravated his knee while making a catch against the outfield wall- an injury that resulted in another trip to the disabled list and continued to bother him during the Arizona Fall League. He had his right knee scoped in February to address lingering pain and began the year in extended spring training as he works back from the injury.  When healthy- Lewis shows the makings of becoming a dynamic offensive talent capable of hitting for both average and power. Big and physical- he possesses easy plus power to all fields from the right side of the plate- albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. The approach is solid- though- and he controls the strike zone well while showing feel for hitting to all fields. Lewis isn't a burner but shows average speed underway- and he compensates for a lack of range in the outfield with excellent instincts and jumps.  The long-term impact that Lewis' knee injury has on his speed has yet to be seen and could ultimately force him to right field- where his plus arm and power potential are both clean fits. Lewis may be slightly behind the developmental curve- but he has the tools- aptitude and makeup to quickly make up for lost time.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/nwMhSV87AD0?autoplay=1,,|,1602,76,210,|,SEA,sea,SEA,,,1st rd 2016,Mercer,,|,,,,,|,WAS,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,55,45,45,60,50,55,60,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,60,50,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

Relief risk- has had a TJ.    Full Report:  McClanahan was in the mid-80's most of his high school career before- just before the draft- a velo bump into the low 90's put him on scouts' radars. He opted not to sign- then had another velo bump early at USF that eventually led to Tommy John surgery. Scouts were buzzing in the fall and just before the spring- seeing McClanahan up to 100 mph with two above average offspeed pitches- but still questioned if he was a starter or reliever. In his first start of the year- McClanahan dominated North Carolina and the consensus is that he would go in the top 5 picks. Things slowly unraveled from there- missing some starts with an illness or a cut on his finger from cutting a slice of bread- showing well below-average command and inconsistent off-speed pitches in other outings. Last week at the conference tournament in front of tons of heat and 2 GMs- McClanahan barely threw any changeups- many of his breaking balls were below average and his command was well below. There may be some teams that think a change of scenery and coaching may tease out those starter traits again- but most clubs (and us) think he's a reliever whose only consistent positive characteristic has been velocity.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  A late bloomer in high school- McClanahan opted for South Florida instead of the Mets- who had taken him in the 26th round in 2015. Tommy John surgery wiped out his freshman year- but he came back and pitched well as the Bulls' Saturday starter. He's kept it going as USF's ace this year- among the best in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings and being one of 40 named to USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List as a result- though his command regressed later in the spring.  McClanahan has as good of an arm as just about any college pitcher in the Draft- and the fact that it's his left one certainly doesn't hurt his Draft stock. He's touched triple digits this year with his fastball consistently all spring- hitting 97-100 on a regular basis. He combines that with a plus changeup- a pitch he throws with good arm speed that features a ton of late drop to it. His slider gives him a third at least average pitch.   While his strikeout rate has been really high- his walk rate has been as well. That- plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil- have some wondering if he's better suited for a bullpen- especially if that could get him to the big leagues in a hurry. With a loose and very athletic frame- though- McClanahan might be able to get away with those mechanics. He's elicited some Chris Sale comps- with some scouts thinking he has better stuff now- at least with the fastball- than Sale did in his Draft year.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ntk-CU1Bo6A?autoplay=1,|,2394,73,173,|,,,,TB,31,,,,|,USF,,South Florida,RS Sophomore,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,70,60,,50,,,,45

In a system that has no shortage of high-ceiling- position-playing prospects from the international ranks- it's Ornelas who might have the most upside. He offered a taste of his abilities in 2017 during his pro debut- slashing .276/.399/.408 with 17 extra-base hits and a 16.8 percent walk rate as a 17-year-old in the Rookie-level Arizona League.   Listed at 6-foot-4- 180 pounds- Ornelas shows the makings of becoming an impact player with his size- athleticism and array of tools. He's an advanced hitter with a fluid but explosive left-handed swing that produces line-to-line contact and big raw power. It could translate to above-average game power for Ornelas as he grows into his projectable frame and learns to hit the ball in the air more consistently. His patient approach- ability to recognize pitches and willingness to take a walk stand out for his age- and evaluators expect Ornelas to trim some of the swing-and-miss from his game as he gains experience.   Adding to Ornelas' allure is the fact that he spent much of his pro debut manning center field. However- he's unlikely to stay there- both because he's already a fringe-average runner and because he's expected to lose a step with physical development. That likely will push Ornelas to either right or left field- where his offensive profile and above-average arm strength are clean fits.,,,,,|,2623,75,200,|,SDP,,SD,,,J2 2016,Mexico,July 2- 2016 - SD,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,55,50,40,50,55,55,60,45,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,45,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

That makes Munoz- acquired by the Cardinals in December as part of the Stephen Piscotty trade- extremely valuable. Already somewhat coveted for his offensive skills- Munoz has now played six positions in his Minor League career.  Primarily a shortstop for the first stages of his pro career- Munoz also saw time at second early on- then folded in some third base a little later on. In 2017- he added the outfield to his resume- playing all three spots. He has a plus arm- but won't wow anyone at any one spot with his glove work- though it looks like he's capable at any of them. At the plate- the right-handed hitter makes a lot of hard contact early in counts- He's super-aggressive and doesn't draw a ton of walks- but he also doesn't strike out a ton and has the chance to get to Major League average power in time.  Munoz's ability to hit with extra-base authority and steal some bases should get him the opportunity in a big league lineup in the near future. His ability to wear many different gloves could allow him to stay in that lineup consistently even without a permanent defensive home.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/McRd9qPdEDA?autoplay=1,,|,1224,73,201,|,STL,stl,STL,,,J2 2011,Dominican Republic,Jan. 27- 2012 - OAK,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,50,45,55,55,45,70,55,50,55,50,50,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,55,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 70 | Field: 65 | Overall: 55  A preferred walk-on at Wright State after going undrafted out of high school in 2013- Murphy emerged as a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American the next year and earned All-League honors in 2015-16. The dearth of college catchers in the 2016 Draft class boosted Murphy's stock- and he became the second-highest pick in Raiders history when the A's drafted him in the third round. He proved advanced in his first full season- earning California League All-Star honors after bypassing the Class A level entirely- and then receiving a midseason bump up to Double-A. He continued to excel in the Arizona Fall League- showing well on both sides of the ball against advanced competition.   Murphy draws raves from evaluators for his athleticism- agility and defensive tools behind the plate. He stymies the running game with plus-plus arm strength and above-average pop times- so much so that only 46 baserunners attempted to steal against him over 91 games in 2017. His blocking- game-calling and receiving skills have all improved in the professional ranks- and club officials consistently praise his ability to handle pitchers.   Offensively- Murphy possesses an intriguing blend of power potential and on-base skills from the right side of the plate. There's some natural hitting ability there too- and he proved comfortable using the entire field in his first full season. Even if his production is only modest- Murphy's defensive chops alone could make him an everyday catcher at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/tVv3ORj53mQ?autoplay=1,,|,1689,75,215,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,3rd rd 2016,Wright State,,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,35,35,55,20,45,70,55,50,55,20,50,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,40,70,65,|,,,,,,,,

He's gotten bigger and stronger and- after making his full-season debut in 2016- has moved rather quickly- reaching Double-A in 2017 while finishing in the top 10 among all Phillies pitching prospects in ERA.  Pure stuff-wise- Kilome is as good as just about any pitching prospect in the system- with a fastball that touches the upper-90s consistently combined with a curve that often flashes plus. His changeup has improved and it could eventually become an average third pitch- something softer to distrupt hitters' timing. He's generally around the strike zone- though his command has been inconsistent as he is still learning to get all of his 6-foot-6 frame in sync on a regular basis. For as good as Kilome's stuff is- he hasn't missed as many bats as you would think. He needs to continue to learn how to sequence pitches and set up hitters more effectively so he can put them away more frequently.  Kilome gets high marks for his makeup and intelligence- as he learned English quickly so he could better communicate with teammates and coaches. He was added to the 40-man roster this past offseason- and the Phillies think this is the year they might find out exactly what kind of pitcher they have on their hands.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/BMD8EhJwlVg?autoplay=1,,|,1422,78,175,|,PHI,,PHI,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,Jan. 22- 2013 - PHI,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,30,55,,,,,35,60,40,60,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,45,55,,,,,50

Paulino needed Tommy John surgery when the Astros asked for him as part of a Jose Veras deal with the Tigers in mid-2013- but they still were attracted to his quick arm and tall body. He has one of the highest ceilings in the system- but he's also its most frustrating prospect because he totaled just 246 1/3 innings in his first eight pro seasons and drew an 80-game suspension last July after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.  Paulino has the raw ingredients to become a successful starting pitcher. His fastball has gone from the mid-80s when he signed for $75-000 to 91-95 mph now- peaking at 98- with a lot of downhill plane generated by his 6-foot-7 frame. He has a power breaking ball that he can turn into a curveball (which can be a hammer at times) or a harder- though less consistent- slider- and his changeup also has its moments as a plus pitch.  Paulino fills the strike zone too- though big leaguers have taken advantage of the fact that his command isn't as sharp as his control. His velocity was down in 2017- though that likely was related to the bone spurs he had removed from his elbow in September.

Many saw a future reliever as he came into pro ball- but after a first full season that saw him lead the system in ERA- there's no reason to think he can't start.    The word most often used to describe Wilson- a former high school football standout- is bulldog. He is fearless on the mound and looks like he should have a solid three-pitch mix to attack hitters with. He typically pitches with a 60 fastball- up to 95 mph- but it plays up at times because of the power sink to it that leads to a ton of ground-ball outs. His slider got slurvish at times last year and sometimes will look more like a curveball- but he's shown enough feel to spin a tighter slider and there is confidence that it will be an average- if not better- breaking ball. His changeup has improved and has a very good chance to be a third- at least Major League average- weapon.    Because of his build- his aggressive mentality on the mound- his fastball-slider combination and his delivery- many saw a backend bullpen piece. But his stuff and command- to go along with the developmental strides he made in his first full season- all point to a career as a No. 3-type starter.,,,,,|,1787,73,225,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,4th rd 2016,Orange HS (NC),,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,,45,,,,45,60,50,,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,45,,50,,,,50

His low arm slot led to concerns among several clubs about his long-term viability as a starter and caused him to slide in the 2017 Draft -- Red Sox ace Chris Sale faced the same rap coming out of college -- but Boston didn't share them and signed him for $2-614-500 as the 24th overall pick. He's the fourth first-rounder in Missouri history- following Max Scherzer (to whom he was compared in high school)- Aaron Crow and Kyle Gibson.   Houck had one of the best fastballs in the 2017 Draft- showing fine command of a 92-96 mph two-seamer with sinking and boring action from a low three-quarters delivery with crossfire. The Red Sox want him to incorporate more four-seamers up in the strike zone- and he can run that version of his heater up to 98 mph. His low-80s slider can be more sweepy than sharp- but he does have some feel for spin from a low angle and his slider showed flashes of becoming a plus pitch during his brief pro debut.  In his first full season- Houck will focus on tightening his slide and refining his changeup. He has a history of throwing strikes and pounding the bottom of the zone- generating whiffs and weak contact. His stuff and competitiveness give him a solid floor as a No. 3 starter- and he has a high floor as a high-leverage reliever.,,,,,|,893,77,210,|,BOS,bos,BOS,,,1st rd 2017,Missouri,,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,50,55,,,,40,60,45,55,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,65,50,,55,,,,55

Signing for a franchise-record $4 million dollars also raises the bar some. Javier's pro career started with a small roadblock- as a hamstring injury limited him to just nine games in the Dominican Summer League in 2016. He was one of the best prospects in the Rookie-level Appalachian League during his United States debut in 2017- starting to show what all the fuss was about.  Javier- who will be just 19 for all of the 2018 season- has already shown an outstanding feel to hit and an ability to make consistent hard contact to all fields. He is continuing to refine his approach at the plate- but he has drawn walks and there is confidence he'll cut his strikeout rate as he figures things out- to the point where some feel he could be a plus hitter in time. As he physically matures- he should be able to use his bat speed to tap into considerable raw power as well.   While he still has some growing to do- he has all the skills needed to be a long-term shortstop. How that will work with Royce Lewis and Nick Gordon in front him remains to be seen- but for now- his focus will be on getting reps and staying healthy in the lower levels of the Twins' system.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/KQM2BzjyTNU?autoplay=1,,|,1078,73,165,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - MIN,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,45,55,45,55,50,45,55,50,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 45 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50    Part of a bumper crop of Atlantic Coast Conference catchers in the 2016 Draft -- four went in the first 43 picks -- Smith signed for $1-772-500 out of Louisville as the 32nd overall selection. The first catcher taken in the first round by the Dodgers since Paul Konerko in 1993- he has lived up to his reputation as being a better athlete and thrower than most backstops. His defense earned him a promotion to Double-A in the middle of his first full season- but an errant pitch broke his right hand in his first game at that level and sidelined him until the Arizona Fall League.    Smith's solid speed would allow him to beat most catchers in a race and helps him excel behind the plate. His good-not-great arm strength plays up because his feet are so quick and he threw out 48 percent of basestealers in 2017. His soft hands and agility are two more assets- and he's athletic enough to handle second and third base in short stints.    There's some question as to how much offense Smith will provide after he had just one big season at Louisville and batted .238/.357/.393 in his first two pro seasons. A right-handed hitter- he has seen his strikeout rate jump from 11 percent in college to 22 percent in pro ball as he tried to tap into his pull power. His upside might be no more than a .260 hitter with 12-15 homers per season- though he does have an eye for drawing walks and his defensive ability will make him useful no matter how much offense he provides.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/PAOgaHuSvPg?autoplay=1,,|,1651,72,192,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,1st rd 2016,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,40,40,50,55,50,60,55,50,50,50,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,55,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

That decision didn't go as well as planned and after an uneven season- he ended up landing in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. His pro debut that summer and the start of his first full season made it seem like the Tigers had gotten a serious bargain- though after earning a promotion to the Florida State League and on the brink of getting moved to Double-A- he was shelved with elbow inflammation that ended his season.  Funkhouser did come back to throw bullpens and got back on the mound around instructs without incident- giving the Tigers confidence he'll be good to go with a full workload in 2018. The right-hander will sit in the low 90s- but can reach back for 96-97 mph consistently when healthy. His slider has the chance to be a tick above average when all is said and done and his changeup has improved to give him another at least Major League average offering. He still uses a fringy curve as a ""get-me-over"" different look for hitters. Funkhouser showed the ability to miss bats and induce weak contact on the ground in 2017- all while staying in and around the strike zone.  The Tigers were extra cautious with Funkhouser last summer. With everything checked out as fine- the gloves could come off and he could start moving quickly as a future mid-rotation starter.",,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/j-b1ZwTMYNY?autoplay=1,,|,1260,74,220,|,DET,det,DET,,,4th rd 2016,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,,55,,,,40,60,55,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,45,50,,,,50

Signed for an above-slot $997-500 in the third round- he easily handled low Class A at age 19 in his first full pro season and finished it with a strong start in the high Class A California League playoffs. He did his best pitching at the end- logging a 1.75 ERA and a 34/4 K/BB ratio in his final six outings.  May has taken well to a number of adjustments that the Dodgers have had him make. They had him shift from a four-seam fastball to a two-seamer- which sits at 89-92 mph and reaches 94 while generating a lot of groundouts with its run and sink. He threw both a curveball and a slider as a high school senior with little differentiation between the two breaking balls- so Los Angeles had him focus on a hard curve that also elicits grounders and should become a solid offering.  Though his changeup is in its early stages and is too firm at this point- May shows some aptitude for the pitch. For a pitcher who's just growing into his tall frame and works with a slingy delivery- he throws a surprising amount of strikes. The Dodgers love his pitchability and competitiveness- and if he adds more velocity once he gets stronger- they could have a No. 3 starter on their hands.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/xvHfqB6Fl5w?autoplay=1,,|,1658,78,180,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,3rd rd 2016,Northwest HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,55,,,,,45,60,50,60,,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,,,,,55

They were confident he would maximize his potential because of his plus makeup- even if it took a while. Despite a torn labrum suffered during his first full season in 2015- and a broken thumb that kept him from going to the Arizona Fall League at the end of 2017- it's hard to argue Tucker isn't way ahead of the curve after reaching Double-A shortly following his 21st birthday.  Cole's offensive game continues to grow as he matures. The switch-hitter is more natural from the left side- but his overall approach has improved and his walk rate has gone up. He makes a lot of contact and there should be more power to come as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. Tucker led the Florida State League in stolen bases even though he was promoted after 68 games and topped the organization in steals with 47 in 2017. That speed helps him defensively as well- and he should stay at short long-term- with an arm that has bounced back to a tick above average since that shoulder surgery.  The Pirates have some depth at shortstop at the upper levels with Tucker and Kevin Newman.

He was at it again in 2017 and even though he struggled upon earning a promotion to Double-A and missed a few weeks with a wrist issue- he still finished third in the system in slugging percentage and fifth in home runs.  Long's left-handed bat is his calling card. Despite his 5-foot-8 frame- Long has shown the ability to consistently impact the baseball. The power is legitimate- coming from outstanding bat speed and very quick hands. He does strike out some- but his walk rate went up in 2017 and he's shown a willingness to use all fields. Possessing average speed at best- Long is an aggressive baserunner who swiped 21 bases in 2016- though that number decreased to nine in 2017. A catcher when he first began his pro career- he moved to second in 2015- allowing his bat to take off- and he's worked to become an adequate defensive infielder.

Erceg has impact potential from the left side of the plate- with natural feel to hit and plus raw power that helps him to generate booming home runs and could make him a middle-of-the-order presence in the future. Erceg has the necessary approach to accomplish that- too- though he will need to simplify his approach.   Defensively- Erceg is athletic as a third baseman- with hands- footwork and plus-plus arm strength -- one that fired 93-94 mph fastballs as Menlo's closer -- that are ideal for the position. He is an average runner but not a basestealing threat.

Both were college closers at Louisville who repeatedly hit triple digits with their fastballs and both went early in the Draft- Nick to the Twins as a second-rounder in 2014 and Zack to the White Sox as a first-rounder two years later. Both needed Tommy John surgery in 2017- with Zack going under the knife in July after spending his first full pro season in Triple-A.  Chicago envisioned Burdi zooming to the big leagues after signing him for $2-128-500- and while his timetable is now delayed- he still has closer upside. Before he got hurt- he pitched at 95-100 mph and touched 102 with his fastball- which has some armside run at times but straightens out at others. His slider reached the low 90s with good depth- and it's a legitimate plus pitch that earns double-plus grades at its best.  He hasn't used it as much in pro ball- but Burdi also has a tumbling changeup that can make hitters look silly when they're sitting on his fastball. Once he recovers from his elbow reconstruction- he'll need to get more consistent with his control and command. His mechanics sometimes get out of whack and he loses direction to the plate.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/qjlYWTBkyNQ?autoplay=1,,|,1680,75,205,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,1st rd 2016,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,NYA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,80,55,,60,,,,40,80,60,,65,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,80,55,,60,,,,45

His pro debut in the Dominican Summer League- where the infielder led the circuit in on-base percentage and finished second in batting average and third in OPS- gave the Mets confidence to leap him all the way up to the full-season South Atlantic League for his United States debut in 2017. He more than held his own as one of the youngest position players in the league.  Gimenez has an advanced approach at the plate that belies his age and experience. He works counts and draws walks while making consistent hard contact with a simple and quick swing from the left side of the plate. Gimenez needs to continue to add strength- and while over-the-fence power will likely never be a huge part of his game- he should mature into impacting the ball more with extra-base authority- eventually becoming a plus hitter. He has above-average speed at present- which helps him on the basepaths and in the field. He has the arm- hands and range to play shortstop long-term and his makeup should allow him to maximize his tools.  Now on a faster track because of the aggressive promotion in 2017- Gimenez's skills and maturity should allow him to keep streaking up the system. The Mets obviously have Amed Rosario at short in New York- and while the organization doesn't have to worry about it just yet- no one worries about Gimenez's ability to slide to second base if needed.,,,,,|,1085,71,161,|,NYM,nym,NYM,,,J2 2015,Venezuela,July 2- 2015 - NYM,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,30,20,30,55,45,60,55,45,45,50,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,35,55,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

He didn't pitch in a game again until last summer- when Chicago never let him work more than five innings in 10 starts. Both the Cubs and outsiders are eager to see how he fares when he makes his full-season debut at age 19 in 2018.  Albertos possesses easily the best changeup in the system- earning plus-plus grades at times because he sells it so well and it seems to disappear at the plate. He sets it up with a 93-95 mph fastball that he can push to 97 and spot on either side of the plate when he's going well. He'll also flash a plus curveball at times- though it's less consistent than his other two pitches because he uses it less often.  Albertos shows some feel for adding and subtracting from his pitches. He doesn't offer a lot of physicality or projection- but he already has plenty of stuff and just needs more consistency.

He built on that performance in his full-season debut- earning All-Star honors at Class A Wisconsin before advancing to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in July. Peralta continued to trend in the right direction in 2017- receiving his first Double-A promotion in late June and pitching well there after a dominant first half in the FSL.   Peralta makes up for being an undersized righty by generating enormous extension to plate- causing his low-90s fastball that touches 94 mph to play up consistently. The pitch is his primary source of whiffs- many of which he induces inside the strike zone- and was at the heart of his Minor League-best .178 batting average against among starters in 2017. His short slider and changeup are both Major League offerings- with the changeup currently ranking ahead of the slider in the eyes of many scouts. Peralta's penchant for generating whiffs helps to offset his below-average control- an aspect of his game that requires further refinement after he issued a career-high 4.7 walks-per-nine in '17.   The Brewers are confident that Peralta- despite his size- handedness and lack of overpowering stuff- will reach his ceiling. For them said ceiling is that of a No. 3 or 4 starter- and it would surprise no one within the organization if he were to reach the Major Leagues ahead of schedule.,,,,,|,1645,71,175,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,April 18- 2013 - SEA,|,,,,,|,SEA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,,55,,,,40,60,45,,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,55,,55,,,,45

Needless to say- they're excited to see what he can do in competition.    Garcia is a plus athlete who largely played second base for the Cuban junior national team- but has been getting very good reviews at shortstop by people like Barry Larkin within the organization as they've seen him get work in at the premium position. His plus speed allows him to have very good range and he has more than enough arm for the position. In the past- he has shown a balanced set-up at the plate and the ability to send line drives to all fields. It's still gap power right now- but there should be more as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame- and he attended the Reds' strength camp over the winter to help.    The Reds have peeked under the hood and really like Garcia's engine.

The Brewers made him the fifth-overall pick that June- and Ray signed for $4-125-000- the largest bonus in club history. Though he underwent knee surgery after his pro debut that delayed the start of his first full season- Ray never got on track once healthy and produced underwhelming results over 112 games in the Class A Advanced Carolina League.   Ray had a quick left-handed bat and a knack for making hard contact as an amateur- leading scouts to project him to hit for both power and average. As a pro- however- Ray has struggled to control the strike zone- often chasing pitches well out of the zone with a lengthy swing. Those plate-discipline and mechanical problems resulting in a Carolina League-leading 156 strikeouts (and 31 percent strikeout rate)- though Ray did walk at a decent clip. Trusting his hands- learning to better recognize spin and becoming more comfortable driving the ball the other way could do wonders for Ray's production.   Ray's plus speed makes him a threat to steal- but his jumps on the basepaths require refinement. His wheels also serve him well in center field- where he's seen the bulk of his playing time as a pro and shows at least average arm strength.

His fastball parked around 90 mph in Cuba- but Perez now sits at 90-93 mph and peaks at 96 with sink that generates ground balls. His slider has gotten harder and tighter- working in the low 80s- and his changeup has improved as well. He has three pitches that grade as at least solid as well as a slow curveball that isn't as reliable.  Perez has lived up to his reputation for advanced pitchability.

Carlson signed for $2 million- well above the recommended value of $1-206-900 for his slot- and made his professional debut the following month in the Rookie-level Arizona League- where he impressed scouts with two strong outings before Seattle shut him down for the season as a precautionary measure.   After pitching at 88-92 mph with his fastball on the summer showcase circuit after his junior year- Carlson began to grow into his projectable frame and had his velocity pick up as a result. He sat in the low 90s and touched 95 at the WWBA World Championships in October and then worked at 93-97 mph as a senior during the spring. Scouts expect Carlson to tack on even more velocity in the coming years- while also noting that his heater already plays above its velocity because it has sinking and running life and he commands it well.  Carlson also fills the strike zone with his slider- an above-average pitch- and his changeup- which features fade and sink. Unlike most high school pitchers- he trusts his changeup and uses it liberally.

With his advanced pitch-recognition skills and feel for the barrel- Welker rarely gets fooled and consistently makes hard contact. Once he adds some needed strength- the bat speed and leverage in his right-handed stroke could generate 20-homer power. He's a below-average runner with decent instincts on the bases.    Multiple Rockies officials have noted that Welker reminds them of a young Nolan Arenado because they have similar builds and put up similar numbers in their first two years of pro ball.

He proved worthy of such an investment during an impressive pro debut that saw him reach the Rookie-level Pioneer League while slashing .311/.398/.559 with nine home runs at two stops.  Lutz is an impressive athlete who shows the makings of five average-or-better tools. The right-handed power he showed during his debut- a product of his bat speed and strength- is Lutz's calling card. He stands to add even more pop by modifying his crouched stance and creating more leverage through the zone using his 6-foot-3- 210-pound frame.

He has a short- strong stroke from the left side and knows the strike zone well- with some thinking he could be a plus hitter when all is said and done. He also has a natural ability to backspin the ball- which leads to plenty of power. Unlike most catchers- Varsho can really run. Behind the plate- he blocks and receives well- but his throwing is an issue. The D-backs feel it's more about his release and footwork and not a lack of arm strength- and he has made some strides in cleaning it up since turning pro.  If catching doesn't work- Varsho is athletic enough for the outfield- with center not completely out of the question. If he has to move to left- it looks like his exciting offensive profile will play just fine there. His feel to hit and his baseball IQ could let him advance quickly if the defense doesn't hold him back.,,,,,|,1992,70,190,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,2nd rd 2017,UW-Milwaukee,,|,,,,,|,SEA,0.500,XXX,|,35,20,50,55,45,45,55,50,55,55,50,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,60,40,55,|,,,,,,,,

That began to change in 2017- when he challenged for the Double-A Eastern League batting title at age 21- hit .407 in the EL playoffs and ranked as the best shortstop prospect in the Arizona Fall League. He was shot in the right hip during a robbery attempt in Venezuela in January and was placed on the disabled list to start the 2018 season.  Though New York has played him at second and third base to enhance his versatility and to accommodate higher-profile prospects such as Gleyber Torres- there's no question that Estrada is a big league shortstop. He covers a lot of ground thanks to his smooth actions and keen instincts- and he has the plus arm to make all of the throws. He's also an asset at second and third base- and he's athletic enough to handle the outfield if asked.  Estrada controls the strike zone well and makes consistent line-drive contact. While he can hit for average- his flat right-handed swing doesn't create much power and his ability to put the bat on the ball actually limits his walk totals. He'll turn in some plus run times out of the batter's box- but doesn't play quite that fast and hasn't shown much aptitude for stealing bases.,,,,,|,1438,70,185,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2013,Venezuela,Aug. 2- 2012 - NYY,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,45,30,45,60,45,55,55,40,45,55,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,30,55,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

His stuff and his history of excelling against top competition led the Rangers to select him in the second round and sign him for an over-slot $1-450-000. He was nearly unhittable in his pro debut- recording a 41 percent strikeout rate and .109 opponent average in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Crouse has the potential for two well above-average pitches- starting with a mid-90s fastball with riding life that repeatedly topped out at 99 mph during his debut. He also flashes a wipeout slider- showing some feel to manipulate its speed and shape and turning it into a hard curveball at times. His fading changeup is a work in progress that can become an average third pitch with more velocity separation from his fastball.  Though there's a lot of effort and moving parts in his delivery- Crouse repeats it well and everything comes together well enough for him to throw strikes. It may be difficult for him to have better than average command- but the Rangers are committed to developing him as a pitcher. He's extremely animated on the mound and has been known to groom the dirt a la Mark Fidrych or throw a shimmy into his mechanics like Johnny Cueto.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/3ehPVLIc5AI?autoplay=1,,|,1968,76,180,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,2nd rd 2017,Dana Hills HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,45,60,,,,,35,60,55,70,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,45,,60,,,,50

The Dodgers spent $31 million to sign him seven months later- $15.5 million for his bonus and an equal amount in penalty tax. He spent most of his first two pro years holding his own as one of the youngest regulars in the high Class A California League- then batted .333/.390/.491 in Double-A during the final month of the 2017 season.    Diaz shows the potential for solid tools across the board with the exception of his power- and he has begun to show more pop after toning down his setup and incorporating his lower half more in his right-handed swing. He makes consistent contact- uses the whole field and shows decent patience at the plate. While he won't be a huge home run threat- he has enough bat speed and strength to provide 12-15 per season.    Diaz has above-average speed but has yet to show much prowess as a basestealer. He spent most of his pro debut in center field- where he projected as an average defender.

Case in point is Barria- a 6-foot-1 right-hander who is all about pitchability over stuff- who pitched his way across three levels to Triple-A in 2017 to earn MLB Pipeline Angels Pitcher of the Year honors and was added to the 40-man roster.  Barria's stuff is average or a tick above across the board- but his command of it to go along with how he uses all of his weapons is plus. His fastball will sit in the low-90s- but he can put it pretty much wherever he wants. His changeup has tremendous deception and movement and might eventually be a plus pitch. Barria's breaking ball has been called both a slider and curve by evaluators- but he's tightened it up considerably and it plays more like a slider- thrown 82-83 mph. He gets more swings and misses off of his secondary stuff than you'd expect because of his command and that ability to sequence his pitches so well.  Barria does it all with an efficient and easy delivery- pointing to continued durability on the mound.

ETA late 2018.,Scouting Grades: Scouting Grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    The recipient of a $500-000 signing bonus in June 2013 after a decorated amateur career in Taiwan- Chang has since blossomed into one of the top power-hitting shortstops in the Minors while making steady progress through Cleveland's system. He was a mid- and postseason All-Star with Class A Advanced Lynchburg at age 20- built on that performance that offseason in the Arizona Fall League and then finished fourth in the Eastern League in home runs last season while garnering midseason All-Star honors in his first Double-A campaign.    Chang's knack for back-spinning the baseball to all fields using a quick- leveraged swing has long suggested that he would eventually tap into his above-average raw power. He did just that in 2017- hitting a career-high 24 home runs- up from 13 the previous year- to pace all Minor League shortstops- while also posting an extra-base hit rate of nearly 55 percent. Chang's game will always feature some swing-and-miss- and he struck out at a career-high 26 percent clip in Double-A- but the overall approach is solid. He'll never be much of a basestealing threat despite possessing speed that's slightly above average.    A shortstop exclusively since the start of 2014- Chang has the athleticism and requisite tools to stay there. The presence of superstar Francisco Lindor in Cleveland means he won't- however- and Chang is expected to see increased reps at other positions going forward. One possibility is a move to third base- where Chang's strong arm and right-handed power would be clean fits.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VDPqWbix08?autoplay=1,,|,780,73,175,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,J2 2012,Taiwan,June 3- 2013 - CLE,|,,,,,|,NYM,0.500,XXX,|,35,45,55,50,45,50,45,55,55,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,50,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

The big right-hander was shelved by a groin injury for the first month of his junior season but excelled upon returning- going 6-1 with a 3.10 ERA and averaging more than a strikeout per inning in 10 starts. The Blue Jays made Zeuch their first-round pick in 2016- taking him 21st overall- and then signed him for $2.175 million- slightly under slot value for the pick. While a back injury limited Zeuch's mound time during his first full season- he still put himself on the big league radar- showing power stuff as well as plus ground-ball tendencies with Class A Advanced Dunedin that carried over to his Arizona Fall League campaign.   Zeuch is a physical presence on the mound and knows how to use his 6-foot-7 frame to create a steep downhill angle to the plate. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph but typically sits in the 91-94 mph range- with outstanding late run and sinking action that helps him generate a plethora of weak ground balls. Zeuch will use both a slider and a curve effectively- with the former occasionally flashing above average and the curve showing good shape with some downer action. He seldom used his changeup as an amateur but has demonstrated decent feel for the pitch as a pro. He repeats his delivery well in spite of his size and throws strikes with his entire arsenal.  The development of Zeuch's secondary arsenal -- some scouts would like to see him establish more separation between his breaking balls -- as well as his ability to stay healthy will determine whether or not he reaches his ceiling of a No. 3 starter. Should that not work out- the right-hander has undeniable upside as a high-leverage reliever who generates as many whiffs as he does weakly hit outs.,,,,,|,1660,79,225,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,1st rd 2016,Pittsburgh,,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,50,40,,,,40,60,45,55,45,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,45,50,55,,,,50

The power has carried over as a pro and he reached Double-A in his first full season of pro ball despite missing six weeks with a broken hand.  Alonso made some mechanical adjustments during that junior year at Florida- and the shorter swing he used has continued to serve him well. No longer are people as concerned about his hit tool and whether he'll be able to tap into that raw power. He has kept his strikeout rate low and has used the entire field more effectively while making good adjustments. Despite the missed time- he still finished second in the organization in home runs and slugging percentage in 2017. A well below-average runner- Alonso is limited to first base and struggled there at times defensively- though the Mets think he'll be capable there.  At his position- there's more pressure on his bat from the right side of the plate.

He reached Double-A at the end of his first full pro season- but still has some rough edges to smooth out offensively and defensively.  Collins' power and patience have been as good as advertised- as he slugged 25 homers and walked 120 times in 152 games in his first two years in pro ball. His strength- bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing give him power to all fields- and he's willing to work deep counts while waiting for a pitch he can punish. Though he has just average arm strength and doesn't have the smoothest footwork- he makes accurate throws and erased 39 percent of basestealers in 2017.  Despite his offense gifts- Collins has batted just .229 with a 28 percent strikeout rate in his two pro seasons. He needs to improve his balance at the plate and guard against getting too long with his swing and too pull-conscious.

The D-backs- who had drafted the left-hander the year prior- brought him into the fold at the 2014 Trade Deadline in the Gerardo Parra deal. A strong 2016 season raised expectations for 2017- but while Banda did make his big league debut- he had a tough year overall. It will now be up to the Rays to further Banda's development after they acquired him as part of a three-team trade with the Yankees in February.   Banda had trouble finding a rhythm during the 2017 season as he rode the Reno-Arizona shuttle at times- often getting thrown from his routine. That did not help him learn to deal with the struggles he faced- both in the tough pitching environment of Reno and in the big leagues. There's still a lot to like about Banda's stuff- though- starting with a fastball that was up to 97 mph pitching in relief at the end of the year. He could settle into the 93-95 mph range when all is said and done. His curveball flashes plus- but it was inconsistent at times last year and he has good enough feel for his changeup to envision it eventually being consistently average.  While Banda remained around the strike zone- his command within it suffered- making him much too hittable.

As a result- he slid to the sixth round of the 2015 Draft- and the Giants have done a nice job of helping unlock his potential in pro ball. He has performed consistently well- reaching Triple-A last year despite losing much of the season to forearm and hamstring injuries.  The biggest change San Francisco made with Duggar was adjusting the angle of his barrel so it didn't point as much toward the ground- giving him a more level and longer left-handed swing and helping him get a better look at pitches. He now makes a higher quality of contact and hasn't sacrificed his control of the strike zone. While he hit just eight home runs in three college seasons and won't ever be a slugger- he's driving the ball more often and should produce double-digit homers on an annual basis.  Duggar can post plus-plus running times but his speed doesn't play that well on the bases. He succeeded on just 62 percent of his steal attempts in his first three pro seasons and needs to be more aggressive.

He broke out as one of their top pitching prospects when he made his U.S. debut in 2015 but has struggled to healthy since. He worked just 39 innings in 2016 because of forearm soreness and just 56 2/3 last year with a pectoral strain.  When healthy- De La Cruz operates with a pair of plus pitches and flashes a changeup with at least solid potential. His 91-97 mph fastball has plenty of velocity and is even harder to hit because of its movement and the angle he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame. His curveball combines power and depth and he's improving the consistency of his arm speed with his changeup.  De La Cruz has a strong- athletic frame -- he weighs more than his listed 200 pounds -- that should lend itself to durability. He has good body control for his size- repeats his delivery well and never has had any problems throwing strikes. If he can do a better job of staying on the mound- he can become at least a No. 3 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/StTOw1iS6Fk?autoplay=1,,|,1155,76,200,|,CHC,chc,CHC,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,Oct. 1- 2012 - CHC,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,40,55,,,,,40,50,50,60,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,55

While some of Rodriguez's numbers have been pedestrian- the Angels have a hard time containing their excitement about his stuff- feel for pitching and makeup. However- the club will have to wait to see him perform in 2018 as a stress reaction in his back this spring landed him on Burlington's disabled list to start the year.    Rodriguez has the chance to have a usable four-pitch mix at his disposal when all is said and done. His fastball averaged around 95 mph in 2017 and touched the upper-90s at times with good movement. The right-hander will throw an electric four-seamer and a distinct two-seam fastball that has very heavy sink. His slider might be his best secondary offering right now- a hard breaking ball that flashes plus- but he'll also show an above-average- if not better- changeup and he can mix in a more traditional curveball as well. He throws a ton of strikes and has made very good strides in refining his delivery since signing.    Rodriguez is a solid athlete who has done a very good job taking care of his body to help him maximize the considerable tools he has.

ETA 2022.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50    A torn anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in his left knee cost Beck- a high school junior at the time- exposure on the 2016 showcase circuit. But he shot up Draft boards upon returning last spring- when he displayed some of the best all-around tools available in the 2017 Draft while hitting .590 with 12 home runs in 28 games. Beck continued to impress during a pre-Draft workout for the A's at the Coliseum- so much so that they gave him a franchise-record $5-303-000 bonus after selecting him sixth overall. Though the results were mixed during Beck's pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League- he did make strides during the second half- posting an .823 OPS with 10 extra-base hits over his final 22 games after producing a .468 OPS in the first half.    Beck is loaded with loud- promising tools. He generates well-above-average bat speed from the right side of the plate- albeit with a swing that currently has some holes and overall inconsistencies. That should improve as Beck gains pro experience- however- and it could make him an average hitter in time. Beck's plus raw power likely will be his calling card and could translate to 25-plus-homer seasons during his prime.     Beyond his offensive tools- Beck also possesses the plus speed and athleticism needed to play center field- where he spent his entire pro debut- though some evaluators peg him as a future right fielder on account of his remaining physical projection and plus arm strength. It may take Beck some time to learn to harness his tools and refine his game- but the final product could be that of a run-producing- everyday outfielder who also adds value with his baserunning and defense.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/oAS3Hzfb8Jc?autoplay=1,,|,2053,73,200,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,1st rd 2017,North Davidson HS (NC),,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,55,60,40,60,40,50,60,55,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,60,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

He rewarded their faith in him by going straight to Double-A for his full-season debut- earning both Texas League All-Star and Pitcher of the Year honors while getting a late bump up to Triple-A.    While some worried about his delivery and arm action pointing to a future in the bullpen- the Cardinals love Hudson's durability and pitchability. His fastball will sit in the mid-90s and he can touch 97 mph- throwing the heater with heavy sink to get a ton of groundball outs. His slider has cutter-like action and is a plus pitch and he's separated out a curve that he showed strides with during his first full season. His changeup should give him a fourth at least Major League average offering.    Hudson can still stand to refine his overall command and despite the good stuff- he didn't miss many bats- though the Cardinals aren't worried about that and feel his stuff will play as a starter.

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Nix reportedly was set to receive a $1.5 million bonus from the Astros in 2014 after they drafted him in the fifth round- but the club's inability to come to terms with No. 1 overall pick Brady Aiken resulted in a reduced bonus pull- and Houston was forced to pull Nix's offer. Both pitchers wound up with IMG Academy's (Bradenton- Fla.) post-graduate program and were drafted once again in 2015- with Nix going to the Padres in the third round and signing for $900-000. He impressed during his full-season debut with Class A Fort Wayne the following year- and continued to climb the ladder in 2017- earning a promotion from Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore to Double-A San Antonio in early August even though he missed the first six weeks of the season with a groin strain.   An athletic and projectable right-hander- Nix generates easy velocity with his fluid delivery and smooth arm action. He operates at 93-95 mph and reaches 97 with his fastball- locating it to both sides of the plate while maintaining velocity deep into games. Nix's curveball gives him a second plus pitch- one thrown with power- depth and bite in the low 80s- and his changeup should be at least average once fully developed. He's a strike-thrower with all three pitches- and has issued just 1.9 walks-per-nine innings in three professional seasons- but Nix's ability to miss bats and overall hittability leaves much to be desired.   Despite being limited by a groin injury in 2017- Nix has proved plenty durable early in his career and should continue to add good strength. Nix has a chance at becoming a No. 3 starter if he can miss more bats and improve his changeup- while his two-plus pitches and above-average command give him a solid- back-of-the-rotation floor.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LM9yJp5lRaI?autoplay=1,,|,922,76,220,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,3rd rd 2015,IMG Academy HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,,,,,45,60,55,60,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,55

That decision paid off as he hit his way into first-round consideration- and the Twins were happy to take him again in 2017- this time with the 35th overall pick in the Draft. He made it up to the Florida State League during his summer debut and managed to finish second in the system in home runs.  During his final season at Mississipi State- Rooker changed his set up at the plate- learning to use his lower half more and shortening up his stroke. It made him a better overall hitter- one who could tap into his considerable raw power more consistently- and that carried over into his pro debut. A total of 18 homers in 62 games might be too much to ask long term- but the Twins feel Rooker's plus power is legit and will continue to play. There's some swing and miss to his game- but he also draws walks. A first baseman in college- the Twins sent the deceptively athletic Rooker to left field during his pro debut- and that's where he'll continue to get the bulk of his playing time.  The Twins have typically been a bit more methodical in the past in terms of development- but Rooker's skills at the plate should allow him to test that and continue to move quickly towards Minnesota.,,,,,|,2095,75,215,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,1st rd 2017,Mississippi State,,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,65,40,40,45,40,60,65,40,45,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,60,50,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

That progress caught the eye of the Marlins- who acquired him- Christopher Torres and Robert Dugger in December for speedster Dee Gordon.    Neidert may pitch with average velocity- topping out at 92-93 mph- but his fastball plays consistently above that grade due to its late movement. He's already adept at commanding the pitch- while his cross-body delivery allows it to jump on hitters on both sides of the plate. Neidert's changeup- a plus pitch- is his best secondary weapon and represents an ideal complement to his fastball- and he also has good feel for an average breaking ball.    Neidert's high three-quarters arm slot allows him to create plane to the plate- and he has enough athleticism and arm speed to compensate for his hitchy delivery.

Full Report:  Murray was a nationally-known superstar quarterback in high school and- though he played shortstop as well- it was assumed that Murray would be the heir apparent to Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M. A shoulder injury limited Murray to DH'ing as a senior in high school and Murray formally opted out of the draft by refusing to submit to MLB's pre-draft medical disclosure. He went to A&M but split time with Kyle Allen as a freshman. Each of them transferred- Murray to Oklahoma- where he backed up Heisman winner and #1 overall pick- Baker Mayfield. For much of this time- Murray wasn't playing baseball.Football at A&M and the time missed due to NCAA transerring rules limited Murray to 64 college plate appearances before this season. Despite it- he has been electric- showing even more physical ability than he had in high school and performing- slashing .290/.390/.550. He shows everything scouts could want to see after this kind of layoff and his only clear weakness is swing-and-miss against good off-speed stuff- both somewhat allowed with his power-based approach. And even more forgiveable when you consider he hasn't seen good pitching on a regular basis at any point in his baseball career. Given these factors- there's a reasonable chance he may be able to close that hole in his game with reps.Murray is projected- but not a lock- to win Oklahoma's QB job in the fall. Teams aren't sure how much it would take to get him to give up football or if there's even a number that would do it- but some teams are kicking around multi-million dollar offers to see if they can buy him out. Given his size- baseball likely offers the most financial upside unless he's a Heisman level performer this year. With some recent changes to the CBA- spreading a bonus over 5 years and letting him play football (like the Blue Jays did with CF Anthony Alford) isn't really an option anymore.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 70 | Arm: 40 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The best athlete in the 2015 Draft- Murray drew first-round interest from several clubs but opted out of the process because he was also the nation's top-rated dual threat quarterback prospect and wanted to play football and baseball at Texas A&M. Despite playing regularly as a freshman for the Aggies- he opted to transfer to Oklahoma- where he had to sit out 2016 before backing up Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield last fall. After looking overmatched at the plate in his return to baseball with the Sooners last spring and in the Cape Cod League last summer- he has shown dramatic improvement as a redshirt sophomore.  Though he continues to juggle two sports and has lost a lot of at-bats while doing so- Murray has made impressive adjustments at the plate. He's making better contact and no longer is easy prey for breaking balls- doing a better job of recognizing them and not chasing them off the plate. He has the plus-plus speed to create havoc on the bases and the bat speed and strength to produce average power.  The son of former Texas A&M quarterback and Brewers farmhand Kevin Murray and the nephew of two-time first-rounder and five-year big leaguer Calvin Murray- Kyler still needs to reduce his strikeouts further and is a work in progress defensively. He's learning reads and routes but has the quickness to outrun his mistakes and eventually could become at least a solid center fielder. His arm has regressed on the diamond and currently plays below average.  With his tools and the surprising progress he has made in 2018- Murray once again is in position to command a multimillion-dollar bonus. However- it may be virtually impossible to get him to give up football when he's a leading contender to helm one of college football's top offenses.

He built on that performance in 2016 at Class A Advanced Lynchburg- where- at age 20- he established career bests in home runs (29) and RBIs (102) en route to the Carolina League MVP award. It was more of the same for Bradley in his first Double-A campaign- as he connected on 23 more home runs while also improving his approach and making more contact.  Bradley's plus power has translated at every stop in his career. He can apply it to all fields during games thanks to a combination of strength- bat speed and natural hitting ability- though he was too pull-happy at times in 2017. After striking out 29.7 percent of the time in 2016- Bradley trimmed his whiff rate down to 22.9 percent in Double-A- all while maintaining the same healthy walk rate he's shown throughout his career. There is some concern regarding his hit-tool potential- but Bradley has made enough strides with his approach and pitch recognition to believe it could be at least below average. He's a well-below-average runner and below average at first base- though he did make gains defensively with extra reps in the Arizona Fall League.   Bradley's bat- and specifically his power- will be what gets him to the Major Leagues. With a few more adjustments along the way- he could soon find himself driving in runs for the Indians.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JeDVcWGcXVk?autoplay=1,,|,779,73,225,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,3rd rd 2014,Harrion Central HS (MS),,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,65,20,40,50,40,60,65,20,45,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,60,20,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

He was back at that full-season level in 2017 when he was sent to the Tigers in the Justin Wilson/Alex Avila trade at the Trade Deadline. He capped things off with a very strong- albeit brief- showing in the Mexican Winter League.  Few question that Paredes is going to hit. He has an advanced approach at the plate and has been described as looking ""hitterish"" in the box by some evaluators. He draws walks and doesn't strike out a ton while showing the ability to drive the ball to all fields. The combination of loft and bat speed should allow him to get close to Major League average power- with 12-15 homers annually a realistic projection.   There are more questions about where he might end up defensively long-term. He's largely played shortstop- where the Tigers will continue to let him play- but he'll also see more time at third- where his above-average arm would play- and second.

He had a history of success as an amateur- including winning the home run derby at the Under Armour All-America Game in 2016 and starring for the U.S. 18-and-under team that won a gold medal at the Pan American Games later that year. He signed for $1-425-400- turning down the chance to play at Oklahoma State- where his father James is an assistant coach.  Vilade grew up around the game and gets universal praise for his makeup and instincts- and he also has a chance to be a dynamic offensive performer. He has a quick right-handed swing that already produces pull power and should deliver home runs to all fields once he gets stronger. He has shown the ability to make adjustments at the plate and his patience was obvious when he walked 27 times in a 33-game pro debut shortened by a lower back injury.  Most amateur scouts projected that Vilade will outgrow shortstop- though he looked a little better than expected in his debut. He's an average runner who may slow a bit as he fills out and doesn't have the quickest first step- but his instincts and strong arm help him make plays. Colorado plans on trying him at third base and he also could fit at second base or in the outfield- but there are no immediate plans to move him off shortstop.,,,,,|,2092,74,194,|,COL,col,COL,,,2nd rd 2017,Stillwater HS (OK),,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,25,30,55,45,45,55,50,55,60,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,45,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50    Kaprielian was viewed as one of the more advanced college hurlers in the 2015 Draft following an impressive career at UCLA that included a national championship (2013). The Yankees took Kaprielian 16th overall- making him the highest-drafted college pitcher in franchise history- and then signed him for $2.65 million. Unfortunately- injuries have subsequently derailed Kaprielian's development- as a strained flexor muscle in his forearm limited him to just three starts in is first full season- while Tommy John surgery the following spring wiped out his entire 2017 campaign. It will now be up to the A's to get Kaprielian back on track after they acquired him- Dustin Fowler and Jorge Mateo for Sonny Gray at the Trade Deadline.    After working at 88-92 mph in college with a fastball that stood out more for its sink and command than it did for velocity- Kaprielian saw his velocity jump to 93-96 mph while touching 99 upon entering pro ball. He possesses a deep secondary arsenal- including a curveball- slider and changeup that all grade as at least above-average pitches when they're on. Kaprielian controls and commands his pitches very well- doing a good job of delivering all of them from the same arm slot.    Considered more of a pitchability right-hander with a ceiling of a No. 3 starter when the Yankees drafted him- Kaprielian has shown frontline stuff when healthy. He's fallen well behind the development curve and will have his workload monitored carefully moving forward- but the overall ingredients are there for Kaprielian to still move quickly once he finally returns to the mound- likely in mid-2018.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/hFv_4TVJwyE?autoplay=1,,|,1267,76,200,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,1st rd 2015,UCLA,,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,45,55,,,,45,60,60,50,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,55,55,55,,,,55

He tore up Rookie ball after signing for $3-282-000- a franchise record for a hitter- but batted just .260/.326/.348 with two homers in 101 Class A games in his first full season. New York sent him to the White Sox in July as part of a four-player package for Todd Frazier- David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle.  Though Rutherford failed to post big numbers in 2017- there were positives. He recognized pitches- made consistent contact and showed a willingness to use all fields- all of which bode well for him hitting for a high average. Chicago believes his size- strength- bat speed and left-handed stroke will translate into at least average power once he learns which pitches he can drive.  Sometimes compared to a more athletic version of David Justice- Rutherford could have average or better tools across the board. He figures to slow down a bit as he matures physically- so he's unlikely to remain in center field despite spending most of his first two pro seasons there. He has enough arm strength to handle either outfield corner.,,,,,|,1704,75,195,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,1st rd 2016,Chaminade Prep HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,50,50,40,45,55,50,50,45,50,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

After a solid debut in the Gulf Coast League in 2016- Ortiz took a huge step forward as one of the youngest regulars in the New York-Penn League in 2017- exceeding those expectations in many ways.  Ortiz improved in every facet of his game while playing at age 18 a year ago and he would have led his league in OPS had he played enough to qualify. Everyone has known his raw power was legit and he started to tap into it during games more while becoming a more complete hitter. He can hit the ball out of any park and to all fields- showing the ability to go the other way. He'll still strike out some- but it's looking like he's going to make more than enough contact to be an average hitter. When he first signed- many thought he'd be limited to first base- but he's proven to be way more agile than anyone anticipated- has worked hard on his outfield play and should be a solid average defender with a strong arm for right field in the future.  In addition to his tremendous offensive skills- Ortiz gets high marks for his work ethic and desire to improve. He spent a good part of last fall in Clearwater- working on strength- conditioning and nutrition.

Though he was bothered by tendinitis in his knees during his pro debut- his upside was apparent.  For an athlete who divided his attention between multiple sports- Thompson isn't nearly as raw as might be expected. His impressive hand-eye coordination should allow him to make consistent contact from the right side of the plate- and his pitch recognition and selectivity are surprising considering his inexperience. Scouts entered his senior season unsure about his power potential- but he began to drive the ball more consistently and has the bat speed and strength for average pop.   Thompson's well above-average speed and his strong arm can make him a quality defender anywhere in the outfield. He's still learning as a basestealer and needs to upgrade his reads and routes in center field.

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50    Signed by the Giants out of Nicaragua in 2012- Loaisiga made a promising pro debut in 2013 before missing the next two years with injuries and getting released in May 2015. The Yankees signed him in February 2016 after he threw 94-95 mph during a tryout- but he made just one start in low Class A that May before injuring his elbow and requiring Tommy John surgery. He returned in 2017 and showed enough during 11 brief regular-season starts and instructional league to claim a spot on New York's 40-man roster in November.    While Loaisiga is small and skinny- he has surprising power to his three-pitch repertoire. His quick arm repeatedly generates 93-96 mph fastballs that top out at 98 with life down in the strike zone. His low-80s curveball features a high spin rate and his upper-80s changeup has nice fade- albeit with a bit too much velocity.    Loaisiga has a clean delivery that he repeats well- allowing him to work the bottom of the strike zone and issue just three walks in 32 2/3 innings last season. His stuff and control give him a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter- though his size and health history are concerns.

While he had up-and-down results in the rookie levels of the system- they always felt there was a legitimate starting pitcher prospect in there and he started to show up in 2017- dominating from extended spring training all the way through his full-season debut in the Midwest League.    While no one will ever mistake the smaller left-hander for a flamethrower- an uptick in overall stuff has certainly helped Suarez- as he missed more bats in 2017 than he had previously in his career. The velocity of his fastball his increased and he's now averaging 91 mph with it and touching 93 mph- thrown with good life to get ground-ball outs. He might have the best changeup in the system that fooled hitters on both sides of the plate and his big- looping curve improved as well- going from a third pitch that needed a ton of work to a third pitch he can count on. He can throw strikes with all three pitches- all coming from a very easy and repeatable delivery.    There is a big up arrow next to Suarez's name currently as he pitches at age 20 in 2018.

He was most dominant as a freshman and his fastball velocity dipped in 2017- which caused him to slip to the Cubs' second first-round choice at No. 30. His post-Draft physical raised concerns about his back- causing negotiations to extend until the deadline before he signed for a slightly below-slot $1-925-000.  Lange's curveball was as good as any in the 2017 Draft- a legitimate out pitch with low-80s velocity and downward break that he can deliver in the strike zone or get hitters to chase. He falls in love with his curve too much at times- which detracted from a fastball that sat at 90-93 mph for much of last year after operating at 92-96 earlier in his college career. He improved his feel for a fading changeup while with the U.S. collegiate national team in 2016 and it should develop into a reliable third option if he uses it more often.  When Lange commands his fastball and curveball- he looks like a frontline starter. When he overthrows and gets offline to the plate- he costs himself control and appears more destined for the bullpen.

After finishing 2017 with a strong month in Double-A- Solak was acquired by Tampa Bay in February as part of a three-team trade involving the D-backs.   Solak has excelled at hitting for average and has gotten on base at every level at which he has played. He makes repeated line-drive contact with a quick right-handed swing and a gap-to-gap approach. While he's not a huge home run threat- he can drive the ball to the gaps- and his 12 homers in 2017 were two more than he totaled in three years of college.  Though he drew comparisons to former Yankee Robert Refsnyder during his time in their system- Solak has a better chance to make it as an everyday second baseman because of his superior speed and defense. His solid speed enhances his on-base ability and he has the instincts to provide double-digit steals on an annual basis. He has a below-average arm and isn't the most fluid second baseman- but he has worked hard to improve his defensive footwork.,,,,,|,1790,71,175,|,TBR,,TB,,,2nd rd 2016,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,45,30,50,60,50,50,60,45,50,60,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,55,40,50,|,,,,,,,,

High- where he pitched as a freshman. While he was gone- he helped Houston County win the 2016 state 5-A title and established himself as one of the top left-handed pitchers in the 2017 Draft. Hall only confirmed that assessment with an impressive senior campaign- and he became the fourth southpaw selected in the Draft when the Orioles took him with the No. 21 overall pick. The Florida State commit signed for above slot at $3 million and then had an uneven professional debut in the Rookie Gulf Coast League.   Hall already pitches with a plus fastball- operating at 92-94 mph and touching 95- and scouts expect him to add more velocity as he grows into his projectable frame. His curveball is at least an above-average offering- thrown with a high spin rate that gives it late bite- while his changeup- though still in its nascent stages- projects to be average. Hall's arm slot can be inconsistent at times- thus limiting his command- though he did make strides in cleaning up his delivery during the club's fall instructional league.  Hall draws comparisons to Scott Kazmir for his build- live arm and overall upside. The Orioles- meanwhile- will be patient in developing the young southpaw- whom they view as a future mid-rotation starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/uN2TRUVwjs4?autoplay=1,,|,2083,74,195,|,BAL,bal,BAL,,,1st rd 2017,Valdosta HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,NYM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,55,,,,,40,60,55,60,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,55,,,,,50

Gutierrez was No. 4 on MLB Pipeline's Top 30 International Prospects list heading into the 2016 signing period when the Reds gave him $4.75 million. He had an uneven first season of pro ball in 2017- but the Reds feel it created a foundation upon which the right-hander can build.    Considering that Gutierrez hadn't pitched competitively in about two years and that he was shut down in August because of fatigue- his peripherals were pretty solid. He showed he can fill up the strike zone (1.7 BB/9) and miss a fair amount of bats (8.2 K/9) at the same time. He does it with a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start. His fastball touches as high as 97-98 mph- but wasn't consistent- more frequently sitting in the low 90s in 2017. He adds and subtracts from his plus curveball without losing bite to it- throwing it for strikes at times and bouncing it as a chase pitch at others. He has feel for a changeup that should be average in time.    Now with that experience under his belt- the Reds feel 2018 will be a true evaluation of who Gutierrez is. All the stuff is there; the next step will be for him to put it together consistently from month to month.,,,,,|,1068,72,190,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,J2 2016,Cuba,Sept. 7- 2016 - CIN,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,50,,,,,50,55,45,55,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,50

His dominance as an amateur carried over to his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League- and Paddack built on that performance during his 2016 full-season debut. The Padres acquired the right-hander for Fernando Rodney on June 30 -- while in the midst of a stretch that saw him toss three straight hitless outings of five innings --- only to have to shut him down with a forearm strain that required Tommy John surgery in August and cost him all of 2017.   When healthy- Paddack has an impressive combination of stuff and feel. An uptick in velocity in 2015 pushed his fastball into the 92-95 mph range in his pro debut- and he's adept at locating it to both sides of the plate. Paddack's changeup is a double-plus pitch and easily his best secondary offering- thrown with convincing arm action and outstanding tumble. He made strides with his breaking ball before undergoing surgery- throwing it with greater depth and sharper bite- giving him a promising arsenal of three average-or-better pitches. The right-hander uses his height to create good plane toward the plate- and it's only going to improve as he adds strength and gains better control of his core.  Paddack returned to the mound late last season during fall instruction league and began his 2018 season in late April. He will need to refine his command and develop a more effective breaking ball- not to mention address ongoing concerns about his durability- but Paddack has the necessary ingredients to develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter if it all comes together.,,,,,|,1923,76,195,|,SDP,,SD,,,8th rd 2015,Cedar Park HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,60,5,,,,,50,55,70,55,,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,55,65,50,,,,,55

After a solid summer offensively and defensively in the Cape Cod League- he continued to improve his game as a junior- emerging as the top college shortstop in the 2017 Draft class before going to the Blue Jays with the No. 22 overall pick and signing for $2-820-200. He made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League before advancing to Class A Short Season Vancouver- where he slashed .306/.356/.419 and helped lead the Canadians to a Northwest League title.   Warmoth may not have a plus tool- but he also doesn't have any obvious holes in his game. He's an above-average hitter- one who controls the strike zone- handles good velocity and uses the entire field. He started to show some power toward the end of his sophomore season- and has enough raw pop to hit 12-15 homers per season in the big leagues if he can get to it with greater consistency.  Warmoth is athletic and runs well- with instincts- footwork and quick hands that help him make all the plays at shortstop. That gives him a chance of sticking there long-term- though some believe he's better suited for second base on account of his modest range and average arm strength.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JW2k6Sivuis?autoplay=1,,|,2032,72,190,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,1st rd 2017,North Carolina,,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,50,50,40,60,50,45,50,50,45,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,55,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Kowar had a seven figure asking price coming out of high school that was just out of reach for clubs. He was set to head to Clemson until a late coaching change and the Tigers lost Kowar to Florida and Cal Raleigh (lower on this list) to Florida State. Kowar's velocity ticked up before he even played in an official game for the Gators- sitting 93-95 and hitting 97 mph in preseason scrimmages before his freshman year. He's kept that velocity for the most part throughout his college career and he's also kept the plus changeup that he's had since back in high school. The two issues for Kowar are his very short stride- which causes his velocity to play down and secondly- his breaking ball. It's never been good and it got close to average with the velo spike improving his arm speed- but it's still most often a below average pitch- with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape.A good pitching program may be able to tweak the pitch using TrackMan or Rapsodo in a pitch design type setting- or just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. This is almost an identical issue to what Luke Weaver had coming out of Florida State and he's largely solved it with the help of a good pitching program with the Cardinals- so the team that picks Kowar could have a bigger influence in his outcome than most comparable talents.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55    While Brady Singer understandably gets most of the attention in terms of the Florida Gators staff- recent history should show the school typically has a deep stable of arms for scouts to evaluate. Kowar pitched behind 2017 first-rounder Alex Faedo and Singer in the weekend rotation last year- opened some eyes with how he threw this fall to jump up on Draft radars and continued to cement himself as a first-round pick this spring    Kowar's size and live arm make him stand out immediately. With a clean- repeatable delivery and easy arm action- the 6-foot-5 right-hander was up to 98 mph this fall and can sit in the mid 90s with ease. It can be a little bit too true at times- in contrast to Singer's live heater- leading to a lower strikeout rate during his sophomore year than one would expect. His changeup is his best secondary offering- a plus pitch right now. His breaking ball is behind the other two- but it will flash above-average at times. He generally throws strikes and his command should improve with a solid delivery.    With some projection and that arm strength- there's some room for growth on the mound. There are some who like Kowar nearly as much as Singer- and the two have combined to be another exciting 1-2 punch in Gainesville.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/6Gnu6dq3LLQ?autoplay=1,|,1313,77,180,|,,,,KC,33,,,,|,Florida,,Florida,Junior,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,65,60,50,,,,,50

The Rays signed Hernandez for $225-000 the following year and subsequently moved him behind the plate- only to see him blossom into the organization's top catching prospect in the following years. After back-to-back seasons in the Dominican Summer League- Hernandez made the jump to the U.S. in 2017 and excelled on both sides of the ball in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.  Hernandez's impact potential with the bat was on full display in the Appy League- where he finished among the circuit leaders with 74 hits (third)- 22 doubles (second)- a .332 average (fifth) and a .507 slugging percentage (fifth). Hernandez combines strength- bat speed and a smooth right-handed swing to generate hard contact with ease- though his barrel path can get long at times. Those qualities also help him generate above-average raw power that he should tap into more consistently in the coming years.   Hernandez's progress behind the plate has been even more impressive- especially when considering how new he is to the position. His athleticism and agility aid him as a blocker and a receiver- while his cannon arm and solid catch-and-throw skills enabled him to nab 57 percent of would-be basestealers in 2017. He'll need to become more durable to handle the rigors of a full season- but all the tools and relative skills are there for him to develop into a first-division backstop.,,,,,|,2568,73,185,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,J2 2014,Colombia,Aug. 9- 2014 - TB,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,25,30,50,30,40,60,50,50,55,20,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,40,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

He spent parts of the next two seasons in the Dominican Summer League before finally making his U.S. debut with Class A Short Season Hudson Valley in late 2016. Returning to the New York-Penn League last season- Brujan broke out in earnest- hitting .285 with 23 extra-base hits while ranking among the circuit leaders with 74 hits (first)- 51 runs scored (first)- 108 total bases (first)- 16 steals (fifth) and a .378 on-base percentage (fifth).   The switch-hitting Brujan is advanced from both sides of the plate. He already knows how to control the strike zone at a young age and recognizes pitches well- with bat-to-ball skills and a knack for making hard contact that led scouts to project him as an above-average hitter in the future. That Brujan rarely strikes out and has strong on-base skills to go along with natural hitting ability underscores his potential as a top-of-the-order presence- a profile that's only enhanced by his well-above-average speed and impact potential on the basepaths.  Brujan's wheels translate to exceptional range at second base- where he profiles as a slightly above-average defender with average arm strength. Tampa Bay's glut of middle-infield depth could complicate his rise through the Minors- though there are many evaluators who believe Brujan could make a smooth transition to center field should the need arise.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/_I0xANEGwN8?autoplay=1,,|,2567,69,155,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,Oct. 17- 2014 - TB,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,30,20,40,60,45,50,55,40,50,60,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,65,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

Though he received consideration in both roles- the Rays liked him more as a hitter- so much so that they selected him with the 13th overall pick and gave him $2.6 million to forgo his Florida State commitment. Assigned to Class A Bowling Green for his full-season debut- Lowe overcame a sluggish start to post a .296/.350/.415 batting line with 24 extra-base hits and 14 steals over his final 72 games.   Lean and athletic with a projectable frame and loud tools- Lowe has everything teams covet in a high-ceiling Draft pick. His left-handed swing is both quick and controlled- and he knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone with his long arms to generate considerable raw power- even if it is yet to manifest during games. The same bat path leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss -- his 144 strikeouts in 2017 ranked seventh among Midwest League hitters -- though he is athletic enough to make the necessary adjustments to his swing in the coming years. Once he's done so- it doesn't take much to envision him hitting for both average and power. The Rays are confident in Lowe's abilities as a hitter and see the sky as his ceiling given the remaining physical projection in his ultra-athletic frame.   After struggling at third base during his pro debut- Lowe was shifted to center field during fall instructional league and immediately proved a natural- with his plus speed and long- graceful strides fueling his impressive range. The Rays think he has a real chance to stick there- and he certainly has more than enough arm strength -- he pitched with a low-to-mid-90s fastball as a prep -- to handle either outfield corner.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0xP4kchoVfA?autoplay=1,,|,1711,76,205,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,1st rd 2016,Pope HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,NYM,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,60,60,45,60,50,45,60,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,60,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

He didn't pitch over the summer as a precaution- but he is fully healthy and ready to go for his first season of pro ball.  While Canning didn't make his official Angels debut in 2017- he has thrown bullpens and looked very impressive while doing so- showing the kind of polish he showed during his impressive UCLA career. He has four pitches- all at least Major League average- all of which he can throw for strikes. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s and reach back for a bit more on occasion- commanding it extremely well. His changeup is his best secondary offering- thrown with excellent deception- while both of his breaking balls are average pitches he mixes in very effectively. He has a strong feel of how to set up hitters- filling the strike zone with a simple and repeatable delivery.  In terms of delivery and body type- Canning has reminded some of Zack Greinke.

Full Report:  Denaburg is a legitimate pro prospect as a catcher- but it's clear that he fits best on the mound. His stuff was at it's best early in the spring when he was heavily scouted in a matchup with Carter Stewart. Denaburg was up to 97 mph with one of the most consistently 60-grade breaking balls in recent memory- which he located well. He came back last week after he missing a month with biceps tendinitis and while the curveball wasn't all the way back (expected)- his changeup took center stage- flashing above average and striking out Triston Casas twice in the region final. As important as the pure quality Denaburg's breaking stuff is- his ability to keep it down beneath the strike zone- and to his glove side is also significant. He'll be able to attack both-handed hitters in that spot as soon as he steps on a pro mound. He's a high-ceiling high school arm who had some injury problems this spring. He's in teams' mixes in the 16-25 range.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  There were several question marks regarding Denaburg- even after a strong summer showcase showing that ended with helping USA Baseball's 18-and-under team win a gold medal. Was he a pitcher or a position player? Would he want to do both at the University of Florida. An accomplished kicker and punter- would he want to keep playing football in college? All of those were trumped somewhat by a biceps issue that sidelined him this spring.  One of the questions seemingly answered is about his desire to pitch. Denaburg had been a catcher when not on the mound- but he'd moved out to the outfield as a senior and seems dedicated to a future as a hurler- though the chance to play two ways for the Gators might still be out there for him. He's been up to 97 mph in the past with his fastball- sitting around 94- throwing it with good life down in the zone. When he stays on top of it- his power breaking ball has nasty break and finish to it- and he shows feel for a solid changeup as well.     There's some upside here to unlock- given Denaburg's split focus- both because of his two-way history on the diamond and his time spent on the gridiron. He has a good- strong body that reminds some of John Smoltz- with a chance for his stuff to jump once he concentrates on his craft full-time. Returning to the mound in May helped prove he's healthy and cement that he has serious first-round potential.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/UE-e6imiR6U?autoplay=1,|,2402,75,190,|,,,,WSH,27,,,,|,Merritt Island HS FL,Florida,Merritt Island (Fla.)

After a hamstring injury limited him to just 59 games at Class A Wisconsin in his first full season- Grisham enjoyed a healthy 2017 campaign in the Class A Advanced Carolina League- where he finished among the circuit leaders with 98 walks (first)- 78 runs scored (tied-second) and 37 steals (third)- but also batted just .223 while slugging .348.  Grisham is still in search of his comfort zone in the batter's box. He employs a passive approach that translates to many walks and solid on-base skills- but also a high strikeout rate and excessive weak contact. The Brewers hope he can find better balance to said approach in future seasons and see it as key towards Grisham unlocking his offensive potential. When he's at his best- and his swing is consistent- Grisham shows advanced bat-to-ball skills- with a stroke that consistently produces line drives and hints at future power potential.   Grisham's hamstring injury has detracted from his speed- but he's still an average runner who earns high praise for his ability to read pitchers and steal bases- which he did at an 88.1-percent clip in 2017. Defensively- Grisham is capable of playing all three outfield positions- though his fringe-average arm strength is a cleaner fit in center field or left than right. With some tools- an interesting skillset and age still on his side- the 2018 season figures to be a telling one for Grisham.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ToL0111crDA?autoplay=1,,|,1162,72,205,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,1st rd 2015,Richland HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,50,50,50,45,50,45,50,50,55,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,50,45,55,|,,,,,,,,

He led the Arizona League with eight homers in his 2016 pro debut as one of three 17-year-old regulars in the Rookie-level circuit. He continued to hit for power as one of the youngest players in his league (the Rookie-level Appalachian) last year and will make the jump to full-season ball at age 19 in 2018.  Though Khalil Lee and Nick Pratto are more refined- Matias has the highest ceiling among Royals prospects as well as the most raw power and the strongest arm. With his electric bat speed- strength and leverage in his right-handed swing- he hits tape-measure home runs and can smack opposite-field blasts without squaring the ball up. He'll need to modify his approach and improve his pitch recognition after striking out in 34 percent of his plate appearances in his first two pro seasons.  Matias has solid speed- but has yet to turn it loose much on the bases. After spending part of his debut in center field- he moved to right field in 2017 and has the tools to be an asset there- starting with a bazooka arm. With his combination of tools and physical presence- he draws comparisons to Yoenis Cespedes and Andre Dawson.,,,,,|,1079,75,200,|,KCR,kc,KC,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - KC,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,55,40,70,40,60,70,50,45,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,55,70,55,|,,,,,,,,

His first taste of full-season ball- in 2016- didn't go so well- but he started figuring things out in 2017- taking the biggest step forward among the top arms at the lower levels of the Reds' system.  Santillan looked more like the future big league starter the Reds envisioned in 2017- finishing fifth in the organization in both ERA and strikeouts and among the Midwest League leaders in several pitching categories. Santillan's plus plus fastball will touch the upper-90s consistently with good movement and will always be his best pitch. The right-hander made huge strides with his changeup in 2017 to the point where it now looks like it will be an above-average pitch. His focus on his changeup did lead to him losing some usage of his slider- though the hard breaking ball still flashes plus.  Command and control will be the next things Santillan will have to improve on in order to make the next step. The big-bodied flame-thrower showed more stamina and durability in 2017. Now it's time for him to put it all together in order to reach his ceiling as a frontline starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/JnLLIhP5nfU?autoplay=1,,|,1291,75,240,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,2nd rd 2015,Seguin HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,40,,55,,,,40,70,45,,60,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,70,55,,55,,,,45

His season went off the rails in the second half- however- hampering his prospect status and leaving many curious to see how he bounces back.  While Moniak really scuffled in the latter stages of the South Atlantic League season- he did show the hit tool in the opening months that point to a future as someone who can hit for average if he can return to his simple approach at the plate. He is capable of being selective and making consistent hard contact from the left side- but he did neither consistently down the stretch. His speed should allow him to steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field long-term- though he was inconsistent on that side of the ball at times- too.  Added strength should help Moniak deal with a full season of pro ball. There's plenty of time for him to right the ship- and the instincts he's shown in the past should help him learn from his adversity and get headed back in the right direction.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8Q3oaLa-Ds?autoplay=1,,|,1702,74,185,|,PHI,phi,PHI,,,1st rd 2016,La Costa Canyon HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,40,60,40,50,55,40,50,55,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,60,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  A standout on the international showcase circuit- Heredia routinely dazzled scouts with his power/speed combination and finished second in the home run derby at the 2014 Under Armour All-America Game. He signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2015 for $2.6 million- the largest bonus Los Angeles paid to a non-Cuban during its record international spending binge in 2015-16. He offers tantalizing upside but also the widest gap between his ceiling and floor of any Dodgers farmhand.  Heredia has tape-measure power thanks to lightning bat speed- prodigious strength (he weighs much more than his listed 200 pounds) and the leverage in his right-handed swing. There are times when he keeps his stroke compact and shows the ability to make adjustments- and others when his swing gets much too long and he looks lost at the plate. He looked overmatched when he reached low Class A last August- striking out at a 35 percent rate.  Heredia moves well for his size- showing average speed out of the batter's box and a step more quickness once he gets going- though he'll slow down as he continues to get bigger. He has played all three outfield positions as a pro- getting most of his action in left field. It's hard to know what to make of him as a defender because reports on him are all over the place- with grades ranging from 30-55 on his fielding and 40-60 on his arm.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/pNLxwMrBLr4?autoplay=1,,|,1075,74,200,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - LAD,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,60,40,50,45,55,60,60,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,50,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

Since the Tigers took him 34th overall that June- he has more than lived up to that hype- hitting 58 homers over his first two full seasons of pro ball and carrying a career .508 slugging percentage into the 2018 season.  Thanks to a very quick bat- Stewart can drive the ball out of the park- and for extra bases- to all fields. There will always be some swing and miss to his game- but he did cut down his strikeout rate a touch in 2017 and he does offset the whiffs by drawing a good amount of walks. He has worked on his overall approach and tried to cut down on his swing to allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power consistently. Stewart is going to have to hit because he is a below-average defender in left field with a below-average arm.   The Tigers love Stewart's work ethic and that he doesn't just spend all of his time in the cage working on his one carrying tool- instead putting in great effort to show he is capable enough to play the outfield regularly. The Tigers think he'll catch what he can get to and won't be a DH only.

When the Rangers signed him for $3.45 million and Nomar Mazara for $4.95 million on the same day- the industry consensus rated Guzman as the better prospect. While that hasn't proven to be the case- he has become one of the most consistent hitters in the Texas system and reached Triple-A at age 21.  Guzman is a bit of a tough profile as a first baseman who derives the majority of his value from his batting average. He does a good job of keeping his left-handed swing compact and making consistent line-drive contact to all fields- and he has improved his patience to where he now draws a decent amount of walks. He never has hit more than 16 homers in a Minor League season- though he has enough bat speed and leverage to develop at least average power.  As a well below-average runner who lacks quick-twitch actions- Guzman's only defensive option is first base. He has limited range and fringy arm strength- though he has worked to become an adequate defender. He presents a big target at 6-foot-5 and has become proficient at digging errant throws out of the dirt.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/MBWS5J7xl1U?autoplay=1,,|,57,77,225,|,TEX,tex,TEX,,,J2 2011,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2011 - TEX,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,50,45,60,30,50,50,55,50,60,30,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,30,45,50,|,,,,,,,,

Elbow issues would subsequently derail Harvey's progress- however- costing him part of 2014 and all of '15 before he ultimately required Tommy John surgery in June '16. He finally returned to the mound in July 2017 and looked like his old self while excelling across three levels.  Owner of a fastball that sits in the 92-95 mph range and reaches 96-97- Harvey also commands the pitch to both sides of the plate thanks to a smooth delivery as well as a whippy-but-clean arm action. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball that he throws with tight spin and considerable depth to create late downer action and pile up whiffs- while Harvey's changeup gives him a third average-or-better offering.  His injury history aside- Harvey is still loaded with upside. The strength he's added in recent years to his formerly wiry frame has helped to assuage some concerns about his durability- and Orioles officials believe he's now better off physically after going through a structured strengthening and throwing program. Barring further setbacks- Harvey- now a member of Baltimore's 40-man roster- could still achieve his projection as a No. 3 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/h6K2W6p8iCg?autoplay=1,,|,303,75,175,|,BAL,bal,BAL,,,1st rd 2013,Bandys HS (NC),,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,60,,,,,40,60,50,60,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,50

After finding new representation- the then-17-year-old Cuban outfielder signed with Oakland for $3 million at the start of the 2016-17 international period. He made his professional debut the next year in the Dominican Summer League- where he appeared in just six games before heading stateside for an impressive showing in the Rookie-level Arizona League.    Armenteros stands out for his hitting ability- raw power- speed and overall athleticism- the combination of which gives him the potential for four average-or-better tools. His bat speed is explosive and fuels his projection as an average hitter with above-average power- though his bat path through the zone- as well as his approach and overall plate discipline- will need to be ironed out.    Armenteros is expected to lose some of his speed and athleticism as he continues to grow into his already physically strong and mature frame. He's best-suited long term for left field- where his below-average arm strength is a clean fit.

Has big raw power and a flat-planed swing that need to be reconciled.     Full Report:  Groshans is a pretty volatile power-hitting prospect who currently plays shortstop on his high school team but probably ends up at third base- and maybe an outfield corner- at maturity. A portion of the industry would also like to smooth out Groshans' swing- but he's shown natural bat control and has the strength in his hands to do damage even if he doesn't time his stride well. This was evident last summer in the PG All American game when Groshans tomahawked a 95mph fastball off the Western Metal Supply building at Petco. There's some swing and miss risk here- which is particularly troubling if you don't like Groshans' hands and think he ends up in right field- but the tools package is electric and he could be selected in the middle of round 1 and probably doesn't get out of the comp round.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Though Magnolia (Texas) High has sent more than two dozen players to college programs- it never has had a player drafted before the 20th round. That should change in 2018- as the Bulldogs have a pair of potential first-rounders in Groshans and right-hander Adam Kloffenstein. Groshans is one of the better all-around hitters in the prep class and doesn't have a glaring weakness.  Groshans has a quick right-handed stroke and has a track record of catching up to and punishing quality fastballs on the showcase circuit. With his strength- balance and mature approach- he makes consistent hard line-drive contact. Once he fills out his rangy 6-foot-4 frame and adds some loft to his swing- he could have plus power.  An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going- Groshans is athletic for his size but won't stay at shortstop after he leaves Magnolia. His solid arm will play anywhere in the infield- where he probably fits best at third base but may have a chance to stick up the middle at second- and he has the makeup to get the most out of his ability.

His elite toolset reminds some of Byron Buxton or Royce Lewis- but the track record is very short.    Full Report:  Adams was not talked about as a top-3 round prospect in this class before late-March's NHSI tournament in his home town of Cary. Adams wasn't even one of the top dozen prospects at the event when it started- but looked like a sure first day pick by the end of the event. He offers top of the scale athleticism- which you'd expect from one of the top dozen wide receiver prospects in the country. He has 80 speed- a loose swing- plus bat control- projectable raw power and athletic actions. Adams wasn't a top tier baseball prospect entering the spring in part because of limited reps- since he was seen as likely to go to North Carolina to play football- where his father is the defensive line coach. He's now in line for a multi-million dollar bonus offer and is expected to sign. We think he goes in the 10-17 range.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 75 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Adams intrigued scouts with his athleticism before arriving at the National High School Invitational in March- and his breakout performance there will earn him a seven-figure bonus -- if he's willing to sign. Also a four-star wide receiver recruit- he's committed to play football and baseball at North Carolina- where his father Deke is a defensive line coach. Teams believe he may prefer to play football- though some will consider him in the first round if they believe he can be lured away from the Tar Heels.  After looking overmatched at times on the showcase circuit last summer- Adams had no problem handling quality pitching at the NHSI. He made repeated hard contact with his quick right-handed swing and displayed at least average raw power. He employs a big leg kick and doesn't have much track record offensively- but he has the upside of a solid hitter with 15-20 homers per year.  Adams' most explosive tool is his speed- which earns top-of-the-scale 80 grades from some evaluators. Just with his sheer quickness- Adams can steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field- and he potentially could be elite in both areas if he devoted his full attention to baseball. He has fringy arm strength- which is more than playable in center- and it could improve if he got on a throwing program.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/dsaEZPyd02Y?autoplay=1,|,2415,74,175,|,,,,LAA,17,,,,|,Green Hope HS NC,North Carolina,Green Hope (N.C.)

They dealt him to the Brewers in July the following year- packaging him with Adrian Houser- Domingo Santana and Josh Hader to land Carlos Gomez and Mike Fiers. Phillips struggled in his first full Double-A campaign but rebounded in 2017 in the hitter-friendly Triple-A Pacific Coast League to earn his first Major League callup in June. He went on to appear in 37 games over four stints with Milwaukee- hitting .276 with four home runs and five steals.   Phillips has a short- compact swing from the left side that produces hard contact across the whole field- though at times he can get too long with his stroke and pull-happy with his approach. His power has played at every level in his career- and there's enough raw power and patience to project for average power as a Major Leaguer. Phillips' above-average speed makes him a threat on the basepaths- and he's worked hard to improve his basestealing technique and reads.   That Phillips offers above-average defense as a center fielder also qualifies him to play both corner-outfield spots. His incredible arm produced in September the second-hardest throw (104 mph) ever recorded by Statcast and has long served him well across all three outfield positions. With an intriguing blend of power- speed- hitting ability and defense- Phillips has the ceiling of an everyday player and the floor of a productive fourth outfielder.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/1bhg4uirVYc?autoplay=1,,|,798,72,185,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,6th rd 2012,Seminole HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,1st,|,40,45,55,55,50,70,40,50,55,55,55,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,55,80,55,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    In three years at UC Santa Barbara- Tate went from pitching three innings as a freshman to starring as a reliever as a sophomore to moving into the rotation and becoming the No. 4 overall pick in the 2015 Draft as a junior. After he signed with the Rangers for $4.2 million- his stuff regressed and he fell out of favor quickly. Texas dealt him with relief prospects Erik Swanson and Nick Green to get Carlos Beltran from the Yankees in July 2017- and while Tate has looked better with his new organization- his future still is somewhat murky.    Tate resisted incorporating some delivery changes the Rangers wanted in his first full pro season- after which his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches flattened out. Since New York allowed him to return to his college mechanics after the trade- his four-seam fastball again sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 98- and he's also working on a two-seamer to induce ground balls. Both his hard slider and changeup show signs of becoming plus offerings- though his slider isn't as sharp as it was at UCSB while his changeup has improved.    Whether Tate will wind up as a starter or reliever is unclear. Though he throws strikes with all four of his pitches- he doesn't miss as many bats as he should with his pure stuff- which could play up in shorter stints. He has added some strength since turning pro but still has to prove his durability after missing time with hamstring issues in 2016 and shoulder woes in 2017.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/fRtkNQHSqXE?autoplay=1,,|,1097,74,195,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,1st rd 2015,UC Santa Barbara,,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,,55,,,,40,55,55,,55,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,60,55,,55,,,,50

The approach has paid off- as Castellani led the Class A Advanced California League in innings (167 2/3) and strikeouts (142) in 2016 and topped the Double-A Texas League in the same categories (157 1/3- 132) last year. He was the youngest ERA qualifier (ages 20 and 21) in each circuit as well.  Castellani's fastball sat around 90 mph in high school but now runs from 92-97 mph with arm-side run and sink that should help him deal with Coors Field. When he doesn't get around his low-80s slider- he shows the ability to throw it for strikes and to back-foot it against left-handers. His fading changeup slipped a little in 2017 but can be a solid pitch when he maintains his arm speed and slot when he throws it.   Colorado officials compare his less-than-smooth mechanics to Max Scherzer's- and like the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his younger days- Castellani's biggest need is consistent command. He has a fast arm and repeats his delivery- which allows him to throw strikes. If he can do a better job of locating his pitches in the zone- he could become a No. 3 starter.,,,,,|,892,76,220,|,COL,col,COL,,,2nd rd 2014,Brophy Prep (AZ),,|,,,,,|,SD,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,,50,,,,40,50,55,,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,,55,,,,50

They saved enough money to also ink Cameron to a $4 million deal at pick No. 37. Overmatched when he gave full-season ball a try in 2016- he also struggled at the outset of 2017 before things started to click. He was finishing off a fantastic second half when he was dealt to the Tigers at the end of August in the Justin Verlander blockbuster.  The son of former big league center fielder Mike Cameron- Daz has the chance to be an impactful up-the-middle big leaguer as well. Mechancial changes that put him in a better position to hit made a huge difference and contributed directly to his turnaround at the plate. He improved his overall approach and has the chance to hit for average and could approach average power. He's not a burner- but likes to run and can steal a base- though he'll have to learn to be more efficient in the future. That speed to go along with plus defensive instincts will allow him to stay in center for the long haul.  The Tigers barely got to see Cameron following the trade- though he impressed with his work ethic and attitude at instructs.

He spent two years in Arizona's system before going to Tampa Bay as part of the Jeremy Hellickson trade in November 2014. He continued his quick rise through the Minors the following year and the finished his 2016 campaign with his first taste of Double-A. Returning to the Southern League in 2017- Williams turned in his best offensive season as he hit for more average and power and tightened his approach. After the season- the Rays added him to their 40-man roster.   Williams began to tap into his raw power in his first Double-A exposure- and that trend continued in '17 in the form of a career-high 14 home runs. It's easy for scouts to forecast even more pop in his future because Williams still produces the majority of his contact on the ground- albeit while effectively using the entire field. With more lift to his swing and improved ability to turn on the ball- Williams could emerge as an annual 20-homer threat.   A shortstop in high school- Williams was quickly moved to the outfield by the D-backs. He's an underrated athlete who moves well and has the tools- including a solid-average arm- to become an adequate corner outfielder. Still scraping the surface of his offensive potential- Williams is seemingly a few adjustments away from putting it all together en route to the Major Leagues.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/qBdkDD7U1B4?autoplay=1,,|,357,74,215,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,2nd rd 2013,Terrebonne HS (LA),,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,40,50,60,40,45,50,50,55,60,40,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,45,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

After leading the Double-A Eastern League with a 2.81 ERA in 2016- he got knocked around in Triple-A last year before a groin injury truncated his season in mid-July.  Beede's fastball velocity has fluctuated- in part depending on his usage of sinking two-seamers and harder four-seamers. He spent much of 2017 working at 90-93 mph after spending the previous year at 92-94 mph with a high of 97. The quality of his curveball and cutter vary as well- leaving his fading changeup as his best and most consistent secondary offering.  Beede throws a decent amount of strikes but his command isn't as sharp as his control- leaving him more hittable than he should be. Some club officials believe he'd be best served by simplifying his pitch mix and attacking hitters with his four-seamer- a true slider and his changeup. Reducing his arsenal could make it easier to refine his pitches and realize his upside as a No. 2 or 3 starter.,,,,,|,806,75,211,|,SFG,sf,SF,,,1st rd 2015,Vanderbilt,,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.650,2nd,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,50,,50,,,40,55,60,50,,50,,,45,|,,,,,,|,55,55,50,,50,,,50

He led the Rookie-level Arizona League in runs (43)- triples (six) and total bases (88) during his pro debut- then ranked second in homers (17) and third in walks (65) in the low Class A South Atlantic League at age 19 last year.  If he can make some adjustments at the plate- Lee could have solid or better tools across the board. Though he's not physically imposing at 5-foot-10- the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing give him surprising raw power. He has some feel to hit and a willingness to work counts- though he needs to tone down his aggressiveness after fanning a SAL-high 171 times last year.  With his solid speed- Lee could be a 20-20 player if he refines his basestealing technique after getting caught in 18 of his 38 attempts in 2017.

He raised his OPS 223 points while repeating the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 2017- then stood out as the best player in the Rangers' instructional league program.  Gonzalez has outgrown shortstop- but still has considerable upside as a possible center fielder with solid five-tool ability. With his bat speed- leverage and projectable strength- he has considerable raw power that's only just beginning to show up in games. His long arms naturally add length to this right-handed swing- but he had a noticeably better approach and made better contact last season.  Gonzalez has gotten faster as he has added size and strength- going from a below-average runner when he signed to solid now and plus once he gets underway.

He has had health issues in pro ball as well- missing almost all of 2016 with hamstring woes and two months last year with a wrist injury. He batted .336/.381/.523 in his final two months in low Class A after his return- hinting at his offensive potential.  Growing up around the game helped Nevin develop advanced hitting skills for his age. He already works counts well and focuses on driving balls from gap to gap rather than worrying about home runs. He has a quality right-handed swing with bat speed and should develop plenty of natural power once he gets stronger and adds some loft to his stroke.  Nevin broke into pro ball at third base but given the organization's depth at the position (beginning with superstar Nolan Arenado)- he saw more action at first base in 2017.

He hasn't disappointed- making his way to Double-A in his first full season- then up to Triple-A in Year 2 while finishing among the system leaders in ERA- strkeouts and wins two seasons in a row.  Clarke does everything well on the mound- but nothing elite that jumps off the page. He has a four-pitch arsenal that he fills the strike zone with aggressively. He's not a huge strikeout guy- though he has an 8.1 K/9 ratio in his career heading into 2018- nor does he get a ton of groundball outs. What he does successfully is keep hitters from barreling up the baseball consistently. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and his slider is his go-to pitch- though he'll flip in a slower 12-to-6 curveball for strike one on occasion and has an average changeup as well.  Clarke's ceiling may be that of a back-end starter- but he's not too far away from reaching it. His ability to sequence his pitches and elicit poor contact will be key for him to get Major League hitters out.,,,,,|,1134,76,200,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,3rd rd 2015,Charleston,,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,55,,45,,,50,50,50,55,,45,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,50,45,50,,,,55

Baddoo was the last of four to be selected in 2016- though he didn't start making any noise until the 2017 season. Baddoo got bigger and stronger between his pro debut and first full year and did a lot of damage in the rookie-level Appalachian League as a result.  In addition to his added strength- Baddoo brought a much better approach to the plate with him in 2017. He walked more than he struck out and that should drive his hit tool- which some feel will eventually be plus. Though he's still not the biggest guy in the world- he makes loud contact and has gap power- pop that should translate into more balls over the fence as he matures. He's an above-average to plus runner who has the chance to develop into a solid basestealer. While his arm is below-average- it isn't a hindrance- and he's played more center field than anywhere else as a pro. He'll keep playing up the middle in 2018- but will also see time in the corners for versatility as an average defender overall.  Full-season ball will be a good challenge to see if the 2017 Baddoo is the real deal.

The Rays have challenged the young left-hander as a result- jumping him over the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his U.S. debut the next year- and then assigning him to Class A Short Season Hudson Valley to open 2017. He was excellent as a 19-year-old in the New York-Penn League- where he pitched to a .235 ERA with a 0.96 WHIP and a circuit-best .171 opponents' average in 61 1/3 frames.   Linares stands out for his remaining physical projection- as he already shows a fast arm with plenty of room to grow into his 6-foot-2- 170-pound frame. That leads scouts to believe he'll add more velocity to his fastball- which currently sits at 88-92 mph and bumps 94. His curveball is an above-average offering- one thrown with tight spin and late biting action- and he also shows some feel for a changeup.  That Linares is athletic and has a clean- repeatable arm action aids him as a strike-thrower- and he should develop as least average command as well. Adding strength to his wiry frame will be key for the left-hander- who has the arsenal and feel to stick as a starter.,,,,,|,2570,74,170,|,TBR,,TB,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,Sept. 10- 2014 - TB,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,55,,,,,45,55,55,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,50,50,55,,,,,50

High. The rawness associated with such a distinction was obvious during his first two seasons- when Whitley appeared behind the talent curve at two lower levels before finishing 2016 on a high note. That success carried over into Whitley's 2017 full-season debut- as he made significant gains in all facets of the game as a member of Class A Bowling Green. Whitley will miss the entire 2018 season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn right labrum.  Whitley's speed is his best tool- grading as a legitimate plus. Meanwhile- after tinkering with his swing for much of '16- Whitley let his tools play in the Midwest League and saw his bat and power blossom as a result. He hit a career-best 13 home runs after totaling just four in his previous 107 games- and did so while maintaining a patient approach and showing better feel to hit. With strength and bat speed from the right side of the plate- he has a chance to hit for both average and power. Whitley's on-base skills remain a strength and make him a threat on the basepaths- where he's swiped 21 bags in back-to-back seasons.   Defensively- Whitley's superb athleticism and wheels give him plenty of range in center field- and he has a better arm than most players at the position. The Rays love his makeup and believe he has both the maturity and mental tools to be successful.

The latter bashed 21 homers (second in NCAA Division I) as a sophomore and 22 (en route to winning Missouri Valley Conference player of the year honors) as a junior last spring- becoming the first Missouri State hitter ever taken in the first round. Signed for $3.7 million- he had little trouble adjusting to low Class A pitching in his pro debut but will miss all of 2018 after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while running out a grounder in Spring Training.  Because he's a stocky right-handed slugger with some arm bar in his swing- Burger draws comparisons to former Chicago third baseman Todd Frazier. With his strength and solid bat speed- he could produce 25 or more homers annually- though he needs to make adjustments to hit more balls in the air after posting a 1.5 groundout/airout ratio in his first taste of pro ball. With his patient approach and ability to make consistent contact- he should hit for average as well as power.  Burger isn't the most graceful athlete but gets the job done in all phases of the game- making him sort of a corner-infield version of Hunter Pence. He's quicker than he looks- displaying average speed out of the batter's box and decent range at third base.

After pitching across two levels of A ball in his first season with his new organization- he pitched well in Double-A in 2017- tossing 150 innings and finishing fifth in the system in strikeouts. The Phillies liked what they saw and were happy to add another young- intriguing arm to their deep stable of pitching prospects in the Freddy Galvis trade last December.  The right-hander is capable of using his plus fastball that sits around 94-95 mph and can touch as high as 97-98 mph to both miss bats and get weak contact on the ground- and improved command of the pitch has made it an even better weapon. His changeup is his best secondary pitch- one that flashes plus with good fade to it- but he doesn't throw his curve as effectively.  Given that De los Santos shows glimpses of three at least Major League average pitches to go along with durability- he may be given every chance to start- with a ceiling of a No. 4 type starter.

ETA 2021., Scouting Grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    A standout for USA Baseball's gold medal-winning team in the 2016 18U World Cup in Japan- Benson continued to boost his Draft stock during the spring as he led The Westminster School to its first Georgia 3-A championship since 1975. Targeting offensive upside- the Indians selected Benson- a Duke commit- with the No. 14 overall pick in June- and he made his pro debut later that month after signing for $2.5 million. Spending all of 2017 with Class A Short-Season Mahoning Valley- Benson tied for the New York-Penn League home run lead with 10- while his 36 RBIs ranked third in the circuit.    Benson's combination of bat speed and sheer physical strength translates to prodigious raw power from the left side of the plate- and he's already shown that he can apply it to his pull-side during games. Making consistent contact- however- has been a struggle for Benson- who has struck out one-third of the time in his first two seasons- though he does work his share of walks. The Indians will continue to work with Benson to clean up his swing- with the goal of getting him in a better position to hit.     Benson is an impressive athlete for his size as well as an above-average runner- but he's likely to lose some of that speed with physical maturation. It's also why Benson- a center fielder in high school- is best suited to play right field in pro ball- where he's an average defender with a plus arm. He may be a bit of a project- but all the ingredients are there for Benson to develop into a middle-of-the-order hitter who also adds value with his baserunning and defense.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/_oDb1oLoVXU?autoplay=1,,|,1671,77,225,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,1st rd 2016,The Westminster Schools (GA),,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,65,55,45,80,40,60,70,50,50,80,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,55,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

He has the best pitchability among Houston's pitching prospects- which has allowed him to succeed at every level of the system. He had his best year yet in 2017- reaching Triple-A while topping Astros farmhands in ERA (2.04)- strikeouts (146) and WHIP (1.04).  Hitters can't square up Armenteros' fairly ordinary stuff because he moves his deep repertoire all around the strike zone. His lone above-average pitch is his deceptive changeup- which he has complete faith in. He can change eye levels by mixing sinking 88-92 mph two-seam fastballs and riding 91-95 mph four-seamers- and he also knows how to play his average curveball and slider/cutter off each other.  Armenteros tends to fall off the mound with his delivery- which throws batters off even more without compromising his ability to throw strikes. He has to be fine with his pitches and he is.

It proved a wise move- as MLB ruled him an international free agent in April 2015- and he signed with the Giants on his 18th birthday three months later for $6 million- a record bonus for a non-Cuban international amateur. Fox struggled during his pro debut at Class A Augusta- albeit after an 18-month layoff from game action- and the Giants shipped him to Tampa Bay with right-handed pitcher Michael Santos and big leaguer Matt Duffy for Matt Moore at the 2016 Trade Deadline. It was learned that he had been playing through a foot injury- and the Rays shut him down for the remainder of the season. Fully healthy in 2017- Fox made his Rays debut with Class A Bowling Green before a late-season promotion to the Class A Advanced Florida State League. Along the way- he represented the World Team in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game.  Fox is a top-flight athlete with plus-plus speed and three more tools that should be at least solid. The switch-hitter profiles as a future leadoff-type hitter- as he employs a solid approach- produces line-drive contact from both sides of the plate and knows how to use his impressive wheels once on base. Fox won't offer much in the way of over-the-fence power- but he does have some strength and can drive some balls to the gaps- making him a source of doubles and triples.   Fox's range- quick hands and arm fit easily at shortstop- though- like any young shortstop- he needs to fine-tune his game and learn the nuances of the position.

Sure enough- he was their second-round pick- and after a hot start to his career in the Gulf Coast League- he was moved up to the Appalachian League- which proved to be a bit of a challenge.     While the toolsy outfielder struggled with the promotion- he made some solid adjustments at instructs. The Braves feel confident that the tweaks he made to his mechanics at the plate will help him moving forward. He had tinkered quite a bit with his setup and they worked with him to stay with one approach- closer to what had worked for him in high school. He has a buggywhip of a swing- and work he did on his stride should help him be on time more consistently- which should help him tap into his considerable raw power more consistently. Waters has plus speed- which will continue to help him on the basepaths and in center field- where he has the chance to stick.

He has produced as advertised since signing for $1.4 million as the 31st overall pick- leading the short-season Northwest League with 12 homers in his pro debut and slamming a total of 45 homers in his first two full seasons while advancing to Triple-A. His 24 blasts last year were six more than anyone else hit in the organization in the Majors or Minors.  Shaw's massive 6-foot-4 frame affords him plenty of strength and leverage- allowing him to hit the ball out of the park from foul pole to foul pole. Though he recognizes that his raw power means he doesn't have to swing for the fences- his left-handed swing can get long and he gets in trouble when he expands his strike zone. His whiff rate jumped to a career-worst 29 percent in Triple-A last year and he'll have to develop more patience to hit for average against advanced pitching.  Primarily a right fielder in college- Shaw spent most of his first two pro seasons at first base and worked diligently to become an average defender there. He's blocked by Brandon Belt in San Francisco- however- so he shifted to left field last May. His lack of speed limits his range- though he does have solid arm strength.,,,,,|,1536,75,226,|,SFG,,SF,,,1st rd 2015,Boston College,,|,,,,,|,BOS,0.500,XXX,|,45,50,70,40,40,55,50,55,70,40,40,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,60,20,55,40,|,,,,,,,,

He pitched well in his first full season- recording nearly 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings at Class A Lansing before finishing the year at Class A Advanced Dunedin. He dominated back at both stops in 2016- only to be shut down late in the season after his balky right elbow flared up. Fully healthy in 2017- Reid-Foley made a career-high 27 starts over a full season with Double-A New Hampshire- albeit with uneven results.   Reid-Foley's fastball can reach 97 mph- but typically sits at 92-95 mph with arm-side run that helps him miss bats and generate weak- ground-ball contact. Both his slider and his curveball- the latter a pitch he picked up in 2016- have at least average potential- with the latter slightly ahead of the former- and his changeup- once fully developed- could give him a fourth average-or-better offering.   While Reid-Foley's deceptive delivery and arm action make him particularly tough on right-handed hitters- they also give him below-average control- leading many to project him as a reliever long-term. The Blue Jays- however- believe Reid-Foley's physicality- stuff and feel for pitching will give him a chance at becoming a mid-rotation starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/iVpbxreVa9Q?autoplay=1,,|,764,75,220,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,2nd rd 2014,Sandalwood HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,55,40,,,,45,55,55,60,45,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,50,50,,,,45

A broken fibula suffered during the Terps' season-ending loss to Virginia that year hurt his Draft stock- but the Rays were still plenty comfortable taking the red-shirt sophomore in the third round. He rewarded them with a breakout campaign in 2017- when he established Class A Advanced Charlotte franchise records in slugging percentage (.524) and OPS (.927) and took home Florida State League MVP honors despite being promoted to Double-A in early August.   Lowe stands out for his pure left-handed hitting ability and on-base ability. He's adept at using the entire field- has consistent pop to the gaps and generates sneaky raw power that he has started tapping into more consistently in 2017. While he's fully recovered from a torn ACL he suffered as a freshman- Lowe will never be a big threat on the basepaths. His average arm plays well at second base- where he's a solid but unspectacular defender.  Lowe's success in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League is testimony to his advanced hitting ability. He may not offer much defensively or on the basepaths- but the potential is there for him to carve out a role as an offense-oriented second baseman in the big leagues.,,,,,|,1351,72,185,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,3rd rd 2015,Maryland,,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,25,30,50,50,40,45,50,50,55,50,45,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,40,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

The Padres took him with the 25th overall pick in June- making Lauer the first Golden Flashes starter taken in the first round since Dustin Hermanson went third overall in 1994. After pitching at three levels and reaching full-season ball in his pro debut- Lauer was a Class A Advanced California League midseason All-Star in 2017 and continued to pitch well after a June promotion to Double-A.   Lauer exhibits advanced feel for a four-pitch mix that includes three offerings which grades as a average or better. The left-hander creates angle to plate with a low-90s fastball that reaches 94 and has natural cutting action- and he's adept at locating it throughout the zone. He complements his heater with an above-average changeup that he sells with fastball-like arm speed. Lauer also throws an average slider- registering in the low 80s- that nets him whiffs with its late slicing action- and a below-average curveball that serves as a change-of-pace offering.   Lauer has crossfire to his delivery- but his athleticism allows him to repeat those mechanics and throw quality strikes- all the while creating deception that makes him particular tough on left-handed hitters. While he doesn't have a true out pitch or a lofty ceiling- Lauer has a solid floor as a No. 4 or 5 starter in the big leagues,,,,,|,1717,75,205,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,1st rd 2016,Kent State,,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,40,55,,,,45,50,50,45,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,50,55,45,50,,,,55

After taking Hunter Greene No. 2 overall in 2017- they went up the middle with Jeter Downs- the Florida high school shortstop who really impressed during his pro debut in the Pioneer League.    While Downs isn't the biggest guy in the world- he's already shown the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently and drive the ball to all fields. He has the chance to be an above-average or plus hitter- especially as he continues to refine an approach that already led to him drawing a good amount of walks and limiting his strikeouts. He's more hit over power- but he should approach Major League average pop when he's fully matured. He's a solid-average runner- at best- but he's an excellent and aggressive baserunner who likes to run. While there was some question about his ability to stay at shortstop because of that lack of footspeed- the Reds were pleasantly surprised how good he looked at the premium position.    Skipping right to the Pioneer League for his pro debut puts Downs on a slightly quicker track for a high schooler. His work ethic- confidence and feel to hit should help him develop into a very interesting middle infield prospect.,,,,,|,2088,71,180,|,CIN,cin,CIN,,,1st rd 2017,Monsignor Pace HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,45,45,40,55,55,50,50,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,50,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

The Twins backed out of a $1 million deal because of elbow concerns that arose in his post-Draft physical- however- so he didn't turn pro until a year later as a sixth-rounder. Since signing for $150-000- he has remained relatively healthy and emerged as the best advanced right-handed starting pitching prospect in the Rangers system. However- he is currently battling elbow inflammation that landed him on the disabled list at high Class A Down East to begin 2018.  With his strong 6-foot-7 frame- Cody can maintain 93-96 mph fastballs deep into games and reach 98 with steep plane that generates swings and misses as well as groundouts. His 82-85 mph slider has gotten sharper and harder in pro ball as he has done a better job of staying on top of it. He overmatched lower-level hitters with it so easily that the Rangers limited his use of it early last year so he could focus on commanding his fastball and refining his changeup.  After Texas let Cody use his slider more often- he went 7-0 with a 1.33 ERA and 93 strikeouts in 74 1/3 innings over his final 12 starts of 2017. Unlike many tall pitchers- Cody has a history of throwing strikes.

But after he returned healthy and dominated in the weeks before the Draft- the A's felt good enough about his medicals to take him in Lottery Round A with the 37th overall pick. Assigned to Class A Advanced Stockton for his first full season- Jefferies logged just two starts before it was announced he would need season-ending Tommy John surgery.    When he's healthy- Jefferies will add and subtract from his heater- sitting comfortably in the low 90s but also reaching back for 95 mph- with feel for locating to both sides of the plate as well as down in the zone. His changeup is his best secondary pitch- a mid-80s offering thrown with fastball-like arm speed and late fading action- and he has the makings of a slider that should be at least Major League-average. A consistent- over-the-top release point allows him to create extension and angle toward the plate- and everything he throws plays up due to his advanced control and command. In general- Jefferies should miss even more bats with improvement to both his changeup and slider.    Jefferies is a good athlete with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery. But as an undersized righty with a checkered medical history- he'll need to prove he can handle the rigors of a full season on the mound. If he can do so- Jefferies' stuff- pitchability and deception could make him a No. 4 starter at the highest level.

ETA 2021.,Scouting Grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    One of the premier prep hitters in the 2016 Draft- Jones likely would have been a first-round pick if not for signability concerns that ultimately led to his selection by the Indians in the second round. After signing for nearly twice slot value- Jones made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League before advancing to the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League in 2017- leading the circuit in on-base percentage (.430) and OPS (.912) while also pacing all Indians farmhands with a .317 average.    A left-handed hitter- Jones combines bat speed with a fluid stroke and natural feel for the barrel to generate hard contact across the field. He knows how to get on base- too- showing advanced plate discipline and an age-defying approach that helped him lead the NY-PL in both walks (43) and OBP as a teenager. And while Jones' impressive raw power has yet to translate during games- scouts do expect him to develop above-average power as he adds strength to his athletic and highly projectable frame and trims some of the swing-and-miss from his game.    The Indians moved Jones off shortstop- his position as a prep- to third base upon his entering the pro ranks. His size and physicality are clean fits at the hot corner- as are his plus arm strength and average speed- though some evaluators believe his inconsistent glove work will eventually land him in right field. Regardless of his future defensive home- Jones has the bat and offensive ceiling needed to become an impactful everyday player at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8MOVqKoFgA?autoplay=1,,|,1670,76,185,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,2nd rd 2016,Holy Ghost Prep (PA),,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,55,30,40,60,40,55,60,30,45,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,55,50,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

He has continued to mash in pro ball- leading the Rookie-level Pioneer League in runs (63)- total bases (161) and OPS (1.052) during his pro debut. In his first full season- he won California League MVP honors and topped the high Class A circuit in extra-base hits (61) and slugging (.514).    Built along the lines of Aaron Judge- Peters has similar huge raw right-handed power and a strong arm. His strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-6 frame allow him to crush balls out of any part of any ballpark- though his size also leads to a naturally long swing. His 189 strikeouts also led the Cal League and he'll have to reduce his 32 percent strikeout rate- though he also demonstrated some selectivity by finishing second with 64 walks.    Surprisingly athletic for a big man- Peters shows average speed out of the batter's box and is faster than that once he gets going. Though he spent the majority of his first two pro seasons in center field- he doesn't have the speed and instincts to remain there.

Full Report:  Gilbert got the attention of Florida area scouts last year when he was regularly in the mid-90's with starter traits- and that carried over to a dominating Cape performance where he sat 92-96 with above average command and off-speed. This spring he started- as many pitchers do- a couple ticks lower but instead of getting back to his old velocity- it continued to slip amid a number of high pitch count outings. Gilbert has taken the ball every week and has performed well- with velocity ranging from 88-91- touching 92 mph in some starts- and sitting 90-94- touching 95 in others- including his last few before regionals.The command- frame and athleticism are stable constants- so he'll still go comfortably in the first round- but there isn't a clear reason for the velo drop. Some scouts are speculating it's a small injury that won't keep him from pitching right now- but shutting him down may bring the velo back next spring. Others think Gilbert would (as many pitchers do) lose a few ticks under a pro workload and become this guy in a few years anyway. Clubs close enough to contention that want immediate pitching help are on Gilbert- like the Mariners- Twins and Angels.,"Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  After a strong sophomore season at Stetson that included Atlantic Sun Conference Pitcher of the Year honors- Gilbert turned in an All-Star showing in the Cape Cod League over the summer. He started out this spring without the same velocity he showed on the Cape- but was still performing well enough to be among the better college pitching options available. As the spring progressed- his fastball started ticking back up.    While Gilbert was sitting in the mid-90s and touching 97 mph over the summer- he was pitching more in the 91-92 mph range and touching 94 mph early on- though was creeping back toward the mid-90s late in the spring. At times his two breaking balls can blend together- but his slider is better than his slow ""get me over"" curveball. His changeup might be his best pitch- though some scouts would like to see him use it more frequently. His arm and delivery works well and he throws strikes.    Stetson has never had a pitcher taken in the first round- though Corey Kluber and Jacob deGrom did cut their teeth at the school. Despite the slight dip in velocity early- Gilbert still is a safe bet to beat those two right-handers- who went in the fourth and ninth rounds- easily.",,http://www.youtube.com/embed/l0Jw6egZzJg?autoplay=1,|,2395,77,195,|,,,,SEA,14,,,,|,Stetson,,Stetson,Junior,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,55,50,55,,,,50

Full Report:  Casas has a long track record of production at showcases and with multiple Team USA clubs- but has been hard to scout this spring as he's a patient- famous hitter that's been pitched around. In the past- this has happened to hitters like Jason Heyward and Braxton Davidson. Casas was a 2019 prospect that reclassified to the 2018 class where he's now of roughly of average age for the class. He's appealed mostly to more analytical teams due to his track record of hitting and the big exit velos he posts- due to his power and fly ball-oriented swing. Casas' cut is designed to tap into his top-of-the-scale raw power and he often does- when he swings.He plays third base now and has a 55 arm that gets into the low 90's on the mound- but he's limited athletically and laterally- fitting at first base only long-term. Some clubs see Casas' mature approach and see a 6 hit- 6 or 7 power future monster that is the rare high school first baseman worth a first round pick while others see a fringy hitter that sells out for power and beats up on non pro-level pitching. There's enough interest that Casas could go as high as 13 and likely finds a spot in the top 30-35 picks.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    Casas is one of the streakier hitters in the Draft class- and he was on fire while playing for the U.S. National 18-and-under team in international competition. The corner infielder was the MVP of the World Baseball Softball Confederation U-18 Baseball World Cup- helping Team USA win a gold medal by leading the tournament in home runs and RBIs. He was named the WBSC International Baseball Player of the Year for his efforts.    Casas is all about his bat and the power he can produce with it. In terms of raw pop- he's up there with just about anyone in the class- registering high exit velocities at various times. The only question is whether he'll make enough contact to tap into that power consistently- as there are some holes in his swing. He loves to hit and does have an approach at the plate- something he'll have to continue to refine at the next level.    While Casas is more agile than you'd think- plays third base at American Heritage with an arm that was up to 92 mph off the mound- and has worked hard to tone up his body- he will likely be a first baseman only in the future. How much a team believes Casas will hit will determine his Draft status and if he is taken early enough to walk away from the University of Miami.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/900T_ozI7iY?autoplay=1,|,2398,76,238,|,,,,BOS,26,,,,|,American Heritage HS FL,Miami,American Heritage (Fla.)

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 50    Holmes was viewed as a big part of the Dodgers' future after they drafted the prep hurler with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and then signed him for $2.5 million. He impressed in his first full season- registering 10.2 strikeouts-per-nine with Class A Great Lakes- and he was holding his own in the Class A Advanced California League when the Dodgers shipped him to the A's along with fellow righties Jharel Cotton and Frankie Montas at the 2016 Trade Deadline as part of a package used to acquired Josh Reddick and Rich Hill. Holmes scuffled with the move up to Double-A in 2017- his first full season with the Athletics- though he did show improvement during the second half.    The owner of a 93-95 mph fastball that has exceptional- late sinking action- Holmes has generated strong ground-ball rates at each stop in his career. He can miss bats both with that and his breaking ball- a plus pitch that combines curveball depth with slider velocity. His changeup continues to be a work-in-progress- one that he'll need to thoroughly develop to neutralize left-handed hitters at higher levels. Holmes has kept his walk rate in check over a full season in Double-A- although both his control and command leave much to be desired.    Holmes answered questions about his durability in 2017 en route to logging a career-high 148 1/3 innings- but the right-hander has been dealing with a concerning right shoulder injury that caused him to begin 2018 on the disabled list. There are many evaluators who still worry about his ability to pitch deep into games- and some scouts have already pegged him as a future reliever. The A's- however- plan to keep Holmes in the rotation for as long as possible- with the hope that he can refine his delivery- develop a more consistent change and improve his command.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/MvTNMZd4LDA?autoplay=1,,|,753,73,215,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,1st rd 2014,Conway HS (SC),,|,,,,,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,55,,,,,40,50,45,55,,,,,45,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,45

Full Report:  Rocker was a famous name in this class as a sophomore in high school when his loose- quick arm was running his fastball into the mid-90's. Since then- Rocker has filled out considerably at roughly 6'5/250- taking after his father Tracy- a former NFL defensive tackle who is the defensive line coach for Tennessee. Rocker topped out at 99 mph over the summer and has been considered a first round pick for years- but had his worst outing of the spring in his last outing- losing a playoff matchip to Cole Wilcox. At his best this spring- Rocker would sit 93-96- hitting 98 mph with a hellacious two-plane slider that was a 65 or 70 pitch for most scouts. His changeup wasn't needed much but flashed average at times and his command was average with control a hair better than that- though some scouts don't love his mechanics.The questions on Rocker were 1) maintaining his current physique 2) maintaining his athleticism to repeat his delivery and stay a starter and 3) having enough feel to pitch and deception to flourish when he doesn't have his premium stuff. Rocker was often pitching on a week or more of rest this spring- so scouts didn't see diminished stuff until the Wilcox outing- when Rocker was sitting mostly 90-93 mph- dipping into the high 80's in the 4th inning with a breaking ball that was a 50 or 55. His command wasn't as good that day and Rocker was hit around some- visibly frustrated. Granted that was one outing- but it could be considered a concern about a prep pitcher with no physical projection that will likely lose a tick or two of velocity as he matures.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  The son of former NFL defensive lineman Tracy Rocker- Kumar also has a football build that has prompted physical comparisons to seven-time All-Star Lee Smith. He opened last summer as the consensus top high school pitching prospect before getting passed by fellow Georgia product Ethan Hankins. Cole Wilcox has passed them both among Peach State prepsters this spring- and while Rocker won't be the first prep arm selected- he still could fit somewhere in the back half of the first round.  Rocker usually pitches at 92-96 mph with his fastball and can reach 98- showing hard sink on occasion and generally commanding it well. There are times when his heater gets hit harder than expected- usually when it straightens out and he leaves it up in the zone. His shoulder opens early at times- giving batters a good look at his fastball- but he's athletic enough to adjust his delivery and hide the ball better.  Rocker generates power with a quick arm and little effort- something that's also evident when he snaps off a wipeout slider in the mid-80s. It needs more consistency- as does a changeup that should become at least average- but he has all the makings of a quality three-pitch repertoire. He's part of a loaded Vanderbilt recruiting class that also includes Hankins.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9ljeJlzB5A?autoplay=1,|,2401,77,250,|,,,,,,,,,|,North Oconee HS GA,Vanderbilt,North Oconee (Ga.)

ETA 2022.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    The cousin of former big leaguer Cody Ross- Rogers showed his potential during a standout turn on the summer showcase circuit but featured less consistency during his senior campaign in the New Mexico prep ranks. The Marlins ultimately nabbed him with the No. 13 overall pick- marking the second straight year the organization had selected a prep lefty in the first round after taking Braxton Garrett seventh overall in 2016. But Rogers never took the mound after signing- as the Marlins opted to give him additional rest- while Hurricane Irma wiped out his chances of pitching in Miami's fall instructional league.    Rogers features an impressive fastball- one capable of reaching of the mid-90s but typically sits more in the low 90s. His heater plays up because of his long arms- deception and very good command of the pitch. The southpaw's secondary stuff is well behind his fastball- as Rogers will throw a slider and a curveball that tend to bleed together- with the former currently ahead of the latter. He has trouble staying on top of his curve- and some scouts believe he will likely be better off sticking to the slider at the next level. He also throws a changeup that is getting better and approaching average.    Already plenty athletic with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery- the Marlins believe Rogers is just scratching the surface of his physical potential. He's been brought along slowly to begin his career- but Rogers has the profile to move relatively quickly as he attempts to achieve his ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/EgPQVpXhSuU?autoplay=1,,|,2085,78,185,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,1st rd 2017,Carlsbad HS (NM),,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,45,45,55,,,,50

Both advanced quickly in their first full years as a pro- with Schwarber getting to Chicago and Travis to Double-A- before suffering season-ending ACL tears in their left knees in 2016. Travis was more inconsistent at the plate than usual last season- though he did get three callups to Boston.  Travis is a polished right-handed hitter with a steady approach. He recognizes pitches and manages the strike zone well- producing hard line-drive contact from gap to gap. His raw power is evident in batting practice and he has 20-homer upside- though he'd have to add some loft to his swing and take a more aggressive approach to get there and better fit the standard first-base profile.  With his below-average speed and fringy arm strength- Travis' defensive options are limited. He does have soft hands and has worked hard to become an average defender at first base. He played some left field in the Dominican Winter League this offseason and the Red Sox plan to give him more time there in 2018.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LgN7aI9Ap18?autoplay=1,,|,837,72,205,|,BOS,bos,BOS,,,2nd rd 2014,Indiana,,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,50,45,50,40,40,40,55,50,50,30,45,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,40,45,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  In the 2015 international amateur class- Lucius Fox got most of the attention regarding players from the Bahamas. But the D-backs liked what they saw in fellow Bahamian shortstop Jazz Chisholm- signing him for $200-000. A solid pro debut in the Pioneer League in 2016 had the organization excited for his full-season debut in 2017- but after shaking off a slow April with a hot start to May- Chisholm tore his right meniscus- ending his season.  Chisholm's knee is fine and he was back in time to participate at the organization's instructs in the Dominican Republic last fall. He has a ton of offensive potential to tap into- with the ability to impact the baseball consistently and plenty of raw power. He needs to keep refining his approach from the left side of the plate and it looked like he was making strides in that regard- raising his OPS by over 300 points over the 10 games in May last year before he got hurt. The D-backs are hopeful those improvements carry over to 2018 and with a better approach- more over-the-fence power should follow.  There is little question Chisholm can stay at shortstop- with good hands and actions to go along with enough arm for the premium position. As a kid from the Bahamas who didn't face a ton of top-notch competition- Chisholm could take longer to learn the approach necessary to tap into his raw tools. The D-backs are hopeful a healthy 2018 will help move him in the right direction.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ir2kVOIT4mE?autoplay=1,,|,1619,71,165,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,J2 2015,Bahamas,July 5- 2015 - ARI,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,50,55,40,55,40,55,55,55,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,50,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

After three years of producing at Vanderbilt- he's continued to do so as a pro- bringing a career .312/.363/.469 line with him to the Pirates courtesy of the Andrew McCutchen trade. He was a week into his Pirates organization debut with Double-A Altoona when a broken hamate shelved him for an extended period.  While none of Reynolds' tools jump off the page- he does a lot of things fairly well. He's a switch-hitter who has shown he can hit for average from both sides of the plate and did so for all of his first full season following a rough April. He can drive the ball and there could be more over-the-fence pop if he can continue to make adjustments and refine his approach. There is some swing-and-miss to his game that concerns some- but he did cut his strikeout rate in the second half of 2017.   Reynolds has played all three outfield positions during his pro career and has enough speed to stay there should the Pirates want him to.

He's hit and should play somewhere on the dirt.    Full Report:  Jackson was bad last summer. He was swinging through pitches in the zone at Area Codes and made some defensive mistakes- so while he looked great in the uniform and taking BP- there was skepticism surrounding his on-field ability. This spring- Jackson got glasses and became such a dominant force of nature that he was intentionally walked in 11 of his final 13 high school at-bats. There's some concern that Jackson's spring is fool's gold as he's performed against bad high school pitching. We're buying the corrected vision makes a significant difference and think he'll hit and stay on the dirt. He projects as a good everyday third baseman.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Alabama hasn't had a high school middle infielder taken in the first three rounds since the Yankees gambled a second-rounder on a shortstop named Bo Jackson in 1982. That should change with Jeremiah Jackson (no relation)- who has one of the best bats among this year's middle-infield crop. He has started a shortstop for St. Luke's Episcopal High (Mobile) since he was a seventh-grader- helping the Wildcats win a pair of state championships- and has consistently performed on the showcase circuit.  An advanced hitter with a nice right-handed swing- Jackson already uses the whole field and manages the strike zone. His quick bat and wiry strength could translate into 15 or more homers per season- and he's showing the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field this spring. The Mississippi State recruit isn't particularly fast out of the batter's box but he's an average runner who flashes solid speed once he gets underway and takes longer strides.  Jackson has the athleticism and actions to play shortstop- but his lack of a quick first step leads most scouts to believe he'll eventually wind up at second base. His solid arm strength works at shortstop and would be an asset turning double plays at second. If he has to move to the other side of the bag- he has the tools to still profile well offensively.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/7Gf--7lf_pk?autoplay=1,|,2432,72,170,|,,,,LAA,57,,,,|,St. Luke's Episcopal HS AL,Mississippi State,St. Luke's Episcopal (Ala.)

Is now a premium frame/velo/breaking ball high school arm.    Full Report:  Like Astros prospect Forrest Whitley did a few years ago- Rodriguez looked solid during summer showcases- then remade his body and saw his stuff explode the following spring. After touching 92 last summer- he's been up to 97 this spring and sitting 92-94. Rodrigueez generates this kind of velo with little effort- his pitches come in at a tough angle and he has great feel for a breaking ball. He's less polished than the prep arms ahead of him on this list but has similar pure stuff and could be off the board in the 10-15 range.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Like Forrest Whitley two years ago- Rodriguez is a Texas prep right-hander who will land in the first round after improving his physical conditioning and seeing his stuff and stock take a significant step forward. He led Central Heights (Nacogdoches) to the Texas state 3-A title as a two-way star in 2017- then consistently worked in the low 90s on the showcase circuit. This spring- he repeatedly has topped out at 97 or 98 mph.  Rodriguez's fastball sits at 92-94 mph with heavy life that should turn wood bats into kindling. He has an array of promising secondary pitches- with most scouts preferring his low-80s slider to his mid-70s curveball- though the latter has nice shape. He hasn't had much need for a changeup but shows the potential to have an average one.  Rodriguez is a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that allows him to provide strikes on a regular basis. His 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot create steep downhill plane with his pitches. His emergence this spring makes it unlikely he'll follow through on a commitment to Texas A&M.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/XVnKhGydp9Y?autoplay=1,|,2400,77,230,|,,,,BAL,11,,,,|,Central Heights HS TX,Texas A&M,Central Heights (Texas) HS,Senior,|,DET,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,65,50,50,55,,,,50

He ranked second among national juco pitchers with 133 strikeouts before the Cubs selected him 27th overall and signed him for $2.2 million.  Little's best pitch is his 12-to-6 curveball- a low-80s hammer when he stays on top of it. His fastball is close behind- ranging from 91-96 mph with impressive movement and downhill plane. He rarely used his changeup as an amateur- so Chicago had him focus on it during his introduction to pro ball- which partially explains his 9.21 ERA in his debut.  The Cubs see considerable promise in Little's changeup and see him developing into a starter with three quality pitches.

A 2014 eighth-rounder out of Stanford who signed for a slightly over-slot $200-000- Slater broke out with 18 homers in 2016 after totaling five in his first two pro seasons. He continued to hit in 2017 and looked good in his first month in the big leagues before tearing an adductor muscle in July.	  Slater entered pro ball with an inside-out- right-handed swing and began to translate his bat speed and strength into power once he started getting his bat head out front more quickly. His increased pop also led to increased respect from pitchers- with his walk rate doubling from 5 percent in his first two years as a pro to 10 percent in the last two. He long has shown the ability to make consistent line-drive contact- but now his power may be more impressive than his hitting ability.  An athletic 6-foot-2- 215 pounder- Slater has at least average tools across the board and some evaluators give him 55 grades for his speed and arm strength. He fits best in left field- especially at AT&T Park- can handle reserve duty in center and right and also has played second base- shortstop and third base as a pro. His versatility and track record of punishing left-handed pitching should make him at least a valuable reserve and he could be an everyday left fielder if he continues to develop.,,,,,|,1537,74,197,|,SFG,sf,SF,,,8th rd 2014,Stanford,,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,50,30,50,50,45,45,55,40,50,50,45,45,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2019.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50    The A's doubled down on University of Florida hurlers early in the 2016 Draft- selecting A.J. Puk seventh overall and then nabbing Shore- his college roommate- in the second round. Though Puk's collegiate career came with more fanfare- it was Shore who was the Gators' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career and garnered SEC pitcher of the year honors after going 12-1 with a 2.31 ERA in 18 starts. With a chance to move quickly in his first full season- Shore instead spent two months on the disabled list with a strained right oblique and logged just 72 2/3 innings with Class A Advanced Stockton. He began 2018 in extended spring training to allow him to work back to full heath from a right lat strain that limited him for much of the spring.    Shore has long stood out for his ability to command his three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise- sitting in the low 90s with late sinking action that nets him many ground balls. His best pitch continues to be a plus changeup that he locates and sinks extremely well- in turn giving him a chance against left-handed hitters. Shore's breaking ball has improved but remains inconsistent in terms of both shape and pace- and it's clear that he'll need to clean it up even more after Cal League righties tagged him for a .303 average in 2017.    Shore will always stand out more for his pitchability than stuff- thus giving him a higher floor than ceiling. He has the potential to develop into an effective No. 4 starter capable of eating innings- but he'll first need to develop a better breaking ball and improve his durability in the wake of an injury-plagued '17 season during which he tossed five or more inning just five times in 17 starts.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/wKX7dii-6gw?autoplay=1,,|,1687,74,215,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,2nd rd 2016,Florida,,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,60,,40,,,,50,45,70,,45,,,,60,|,,,,,,|,55,60,,45,,,,55

Full Report:  The younger brother of Padres prospect Josh Naylor- 'Bo' is a better athlete with similar feel to hit- but less raw power. He has the neccesary twitch and just enough pure arm strength to catch as long as his throws becaome more accurate. There's a subsection of teams who like him better at third base because they think he'll move more quickly through the minors by avoiding the developmental burdens of catching and/or because the physical grind of catching often dilutes offensive production. Naylor is athletic enough for this- as well. Even if Naylor's in-game power manifests itself as doubles- he profiles at either spot.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 45 | Overall: 50    The younger brother of Padres first base prospect Josh Naylor- Noah has a similar offensive profile to his sibling- but with one difference in his overall game: his ability to catch. His combination of a power bat and power arm were on display over the summer and was watched carefully when the Canadian high schoolers started playing this spring.    The power bat was definitely on display at Marlins Park in Miami as Major League Baseball's All-Star Break commenced. On the Sunday morning before the Futures Game his brother would play in- Naylor out-homered top prospect Nolan Gorman in the annual High School Home Run Derby and got to take hacks in between rounds of the big league derby. In game action- he's shown an advanced feel to hit- giving him the chance to hit for average and power. His defensive game is a bit behind his bat- outside of his arm- which is a plus tool that helps control a running game. To show he can stick behind the plate- he'll have to improve his overall receiving skills- with many scouts seeing strides in his defensive work this spring.    Naylor did play some third base during the Area Code Games and showed some agility there- and there's always the chance he could join his brother among the first base ranks.

Full Report:  Rolison was a big name out of high school- reportefly turning down seven figures to go to Ole Miss knowing he would be an eligible sophomore due to his age. He's had an up-and-down spring- coming out of the chute blazing hot- leading to top-10 pick momentum for the first month of the season- then slowly regressing in performance- fastball command and changeup usage. Most scouts think Rolison needs a delivery adjustment in pro ball to make himself more online to the plate as a way to improve his fastball command. That would likely tease out a bit more performance from Rolison's above-average stuff- but he's been too reliant on his plus curveball. To that point- hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch- knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and he barely threw his changeup- including his disastrous outing at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs. Rolison has interest as high as 11th overall to Baltimore and a couple other spots in the teens- but his mixed second half of the season has his likely range more in the 20s.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 60 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Scouts considered Rolison one of the most polished high school left-handers in the 2016 Draft- but his determination to attend Mississippi dropped him to the Padres in the 37th round. He emerged as the Rebels' most reliable starter in the second half of his 2017 freshman season and starred in the Cape Cod League during the summer- putting himself in position to join Drew Pomeranz as the only players in school history to go in the first round. He has maintained that status despite being a little inconsistent this spring.  Rolison has one of the best curveballs in the Draft- a sharp breaker with power and depth. He works in the low 90s with his fastball- can hit 95 mph when he needs to and locates his heater to either side of the plate. He also mixes in a slider with some tilt and a changeup with some fade.  Add in his athleticism- strong build and easy delivery- and Rolison has everything he needs to remain a starter at the next level. His stuff and his control have improved in each of the last two years- and he may not be done getting better. He has extra leverage as a Draft-eligible sophomore.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ayEAfzM9lDo?autoplay=1,|,1740,74,195,|,,,,COL,22,,,,|,Ole Miss,,Mississippi,Sophomore,|,SD,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,50,60,50,,,,50

The problems persisted that summer and into 2016- limiting the talented outfielder to just 236 at-bats over two summers. In 2017 he avoided leg injuries- but an elbow problem ended his season in July with ulnar nerve surgery.  The good news is that despite all the missed time- Lindsay still shows solid tools at the plate. Trouble seeing the ball led to a rough start during his first taste of full-season ball in 2017- but after that was addressed with a new prescription- he started to hit for average and power before his season ended. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks- albeit with a fairly high strikeout rate- though that improved with the sight adjustment. He still runs well- despite the leg issues- and while he was hesitant because of the injuries- he might get the green light more moving forward on the basepaths and it allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field. His arm is fine for center- but he'd likely have to move to left should he slow down.  The first order of business is for Lindsay to get a full season of reps in on both sides of the ball so he can continue refining his approach at the plate as well as his reads and routes in the outfield. If he can do that- then it might be easier to project his upside.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/akUuQZG6dnk?autoplay=1,,|,1397,72,200,|,NYM,nym,NYM,,,2nd rd 2015,Out of Door Academy HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,STL,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,60,60,30,50,45,50,60,55,45,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,60,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2021,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Enlow was one of many high school pitchers in the 2017 Draft class who were in many late first-round conversations. He ended up sliding a bit to the second round after a bit of a velocity dip during his senior season combined with his commitment to LSU. The Twins used their bonus pool wisely and had $2 million- more than twice pick value- to sign him and he had a strong- albeit brief- debut in the Gulf Coast League.  Armed with a strong three-pitch mix and the ability to throw all of it for strikes- one of the biggest things Enlow needed to do was add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame and show he could maintain velocity throughout starts and through a season. Once listed at 170 pounds- Enlow was up over 190 thanks to strength and conditioning efforts during the offseason. That should help him keep his fastball at least in the low-90s consistently and make the times he touches 94-95 mph much more frequent. His curve ball is the pitch that separates him from other young arms- perhaps- a true 12-to-6 power breaking ball. He hasn't needed his changeup a ton in the past- but he has good feel for it.  The Twins are very excited to see what Enlow can do after his productive offseason. His stuff- projectability and feel for the strike zone all point to a young arm who could be a relatively fast mover.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/aZJ78IL6QJ8?autoplay=1,,|,2087,75,170,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,3rd rd 2017,St. Amat HS (LA),,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,,50,,,,40,55,50,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,50,60,,,,,55

ETA late 2019.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 60 | Arm: 65 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  After transferring from Northeast Oklahoma A&M to New Mexico State- Johnson garnered Western Athletic Conference player of the year honors after he paced the circuit in average (.382)- home runs (12) and stolen bases (29) in his second year with the Aggies. The Nationals- intrigued by Johnson's loud tools and breakout performance- gave him $325-000 as their fifth-round pick in the 2016 Draft. Those tools translated to eye-opening production in Johnson's first full season- as he produced a .298 average with 22 home runs and 22 steals between the Class A and Class A Advanced levels before gaining additional experience in the Arizona Fall League.  Johnson's physical strength and lightning-quick bat speed help him to generate plus raw power from the left side of the plate- and he surprised with his ability to get to it consistently during games in 2017. Improved plate discipline and pitch recognition- along with better feel for using the entire field- gives Johnson a chance to hit for average- but he will always have some swing-and-miss to his game and will need figure out left-handed pitching. Johnson also knows how to impact games on the basepaths with his plus speed- though his basestealing technique leaves something to be desired.   The Nationals were pleased with Johnson's defensive strides in 2017 and believe he has a non-zero chance of sticking in center field. He's also seen considerable playing time in right field- and some evaluators think that will be his long-term home on account of his cannon arm. Johnson could develop into a dynamic outfielder who contributes in all facets of the game if his development goes as hoped- while his power-speed combo portends a solid big league floor.,,,,,|,1847,70,185,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,5th rd 2016,New Mexico State,,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,55,70,40,70,40,45,55,70,50,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,60,65,55,|,,,,,,,,

A torn ACL during the fall of his senior year left many wondering how much mound time he'd get- but he turned out to be the best prep prospect in the state. The Pirates went above pick value to sign him for $1.9 million in the second round and he made his pro debut in the Gulf Coast League.  Jennings provides an intriguing combination of feel for pitching- projectability and athleticism to the system. He's more of a pitchability right-hander right now- with a fastball he throws 89-92 mph. But he can reach back for more and there might be more velocity to come as he physically matures. He commands the fastball well- moves it in and out and throws it with movement. He'll throw two breaking balls- the slider is liked more by evaluators- and he might focus on just one in the future- and he has good feel for his changeup.  The athleticism comes in handy in terms of repeating his delivery and filling the strike zone with all of his pitches.

He has improved as he has advanced through the Red Sox system and claimed the organization's pitcher of the year award in 2017. He reduced his Double-A ERA to 2.19 from 4.68 the previous year and continued to pitch well in his first taste of Triple-A.  Beeks' most reliable offering is a 91-93 mph fastball that maxes out at 95 and plays above its velocity because of high spin rate and deception. He ran into trouble in 2016 after his changeup lost its tumble- but it became a solid pitch again last year. He had to rely more on his slider when his changeup deserted him- and he turned it into more of a mid-80s cutter in 2017.  To give batters a different look- Beeks also uses a slow curveball that can flash average at times. His delivery features some effort- but it also throws hitters' timing off without causing major control issues.

He spent the first five weeks of 2017 in the Aggies bullpen before moving to the rotation and flashing first-round potential before tiring as the Draft approached. The Astros took him with a second-round choice received from the Cardinals as punishment for a hacking scandal and signed him for a below-slot $1 million.  Martin showcased a 95-98 mph fastball with running life as a Cape reliever and dials it down to 92-96 as a starter- though he dipped to 88-92 at the end of his first pro summer. His curveball combines power and depth and can be more devastating than his fastball- flashing as a well above-average offering at times. He also can miss bats with a mid-80s slider and shows some feel for a changeup that shows signs of becoming a solid pitch as he's learning to trust it.  Commanding his fastball will be the key to Martin realizing his potential as a mid-rotation starter.

He's had a number of minor injuries this spring so scouts don't have the long track record they'd like- but the upside is among the best in the class.    Full Report:  Scott was a big name as a freshman at Plant High School as he was the spitting image of teammate and eventual #5 overall pick Kyle Tucker- with a lanky frame and loose- gloveless- lefty swing. Scott is a superior athlete to Tucker- as Scott has been into the mid-90's on the mound with three average or better pitches and 70 speed that profiles in center field. Scott doesn't appear to like pitching so scouts haven't seen him throw much- but he's easily a top-5 round prospect on the hill. While he's played in some high-profile prep games around Tampa (mostly for scouts who are based in the area)- Scott only went to a few national events this summer.This- combined with a number of minor spring injuries (hamstring and concussion the most notable) have made Scott hard for decision makers to see- and thus slid him down around the 20's rather than around 10- where his tools belong alongside Kelenic and Gorman at the top of the class. Some scouts that got positive preseason looks predicted Scott would be this year's Austin Beck and shoot into the top 10 picks- but that likely won't happen. It's unclear if this uneven track record is predictive of Scott not hitting his upside- but some teams are treating it that way and we also simply didn't get enough looks to pound the table in the top half of the first round.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 70 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    H.B. Plant High School in Tampa has churned out more than its fair share of Draft talent- none more famous than Hall of Famer Wade Boggs. More recently- it produced outfielder Kyle Tucker- who went No. 5 in the 2015 Draft to the Astros and is one of the top prospects in baseball. Scott gets some comps to his former Plant outfield mate- albeit with less power and more speed.    Scott does have the makings of a five-tool player. Currently- his standout tool is his speed- which he uses to get down the line in a hurry and run down balls in center field. He has really good hands to hit and some feel the 6-foot-4 left-handed hitter will add power once he starts incorporating his lower half more consistently. He can defend in the outfield to go along with a plus arm.    Committed to the University of Florida- Scott does have a backup plan on the mound- with a fastball up to 93 mph and a decent curve from the left side. But his tools on both sides of the ball as an outfielder should have him in play in the early going- and he was firmly in first-round conversations despite missing time with a hamstring injury.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0xcsCdAtkPM?autoplay=1,|,2396,76,180,|,,,,MIA,13,,,,|,Plant HS FL,Florida,Plant (Fla.)

While he impressed in his full-season debut the following year- Miami suspended Naylor in June after he was the perpetrator of a knife ""prank gone wrong"" that resulted in teammate Stone Garrett needing thumb surgery and a lengthy stint on the disabled list. In July- the Marlins dealt Naylor to the Padres in a deal for Andrew Cashner- Colin Rea and Tayron Guerrero. After earning a second Futures Game selection in 2017- Naylor reached Double-A for the first time at age 20.  Though known best for his robust left-handed raw power- Naylor has stood out more for his hitting ability early in his career. The Ontario native makes hard contact to all fields thanks to his plus bat speed and excellent hand-eye coordination- all while keeping his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time. Naylor tightened his approach in 2017 and as a result had both his strikeout and walk rates move in positive directions. However- it's that same approach that can make Naylor too passive at the plate and fuel the pitch-selection issues that prevent him from getting to his power during games.  Naylor is short and stocky but also a good athlete for his size- with surprising- albeit below-average- speed. He's made strides with his defense at first base but still profiles as a below-average defender there. Defensive concerns aside- Naylor will have to tap into his power to make his first-base-only profile work at the highest level.",,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/N59Wtnb9Eyw?autoplay=1,,|,1288,71,250,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,1st rd 2015,St. Joan of Arc HS (CAN),,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,70,20,30,55,55,40,70,20,40,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,40,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45  Brought along slowly by the Mets to open his career- Gonzalez threw well in his U.S. debut in 2015 then backed it up with a New York-Penn League season that saw him finish in the top 10 in ERA and strikeouts. His full-season debut was equally impressive as he pitched himself from the South Atlantic League up to the Class A Advanced Florida State League before heading to the Marlins in late July as part of the A.J. Ramos deal. Gonzalez would continue to thrive after the trade- ultimately finishing the season second in the Minors in ERA (1.66) and 10th in WHIP (0.97).   Though slightly undersized- Gonzalez is loaded with arm strength. He operates at 93-95 mph with his fastball but can reach back for 96-97- all while pitching to both sides of the plate. His low-80s curveball is an above-average pitch- one thrown with power and top-to-bottom shape- and his changeup has developed with experience. While he's generally around the strike zone- he does leave balls in the middle of the plate at times. With good athleticism and a repeatable delivery- his command should improve over time.  Better command and developing a more consistent changeup could go a long in Gonzalez's efforts to remain a starter. If he can't- the right-hander's fastball-breaking ball combination would play up very well in a relief role.,,,,,|,1835,72,216,|,,mia,MIA,,,,,March 6- 2013 - NYM,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,45,55,,,,,45

Dubon made additional strides in his first season as a Brewer- splitting the year between Double-A Biloxi and Triple-A Colorado Springs while representing the World Team in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game along the way. In the wake of Dubon's strong season- the Brewers added him to their 40-man roster in November.    Dubon can do a little bit of everything on the diamond. At the dish- he exhibits excellent hand-eye coordination and a quick right-handed bat- allowing him to generate barreled- line-drive contact with relative ease. Those qualities along with his solid approach lead scouts to project him as at least an average hitter. Dubon also has had his power tick up as he's grown stronger- and it's resulted in improved home-run totals in each of his five seasons and a career-high eight in 2017. However- hitting for consistent power will never be a part of his game- and he's more likely to be a source of doubles and triples. Dubon's extra-base-hit totals are also a product of the plus speed that has netted him at least 30 steals in three straight seasons.    Dubon is a true middle infielder- one with quick hands and feet as well as the arm strength to make plays from either side of the bag. He split time in 2017 between both shortstop and second base- showing well at both spots- and it's fair to think he'll be able to play whatever position the Brewers ask of him. That versatility- as well as his likely contributions at the plate- gives Dubon a high floor as a big leaguer.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/MgNeizABbjY?autoplay=1,,|,1474,72,160,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,26th rd 2013,Capital Christian HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,1st,|,50,30,40,55,45,55,55,30,40,55,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,35,60,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

A move to the rotation during his junior season greatly improved his Draft stock- landing him in the first round where the Mets nabbed him with the No. 19 pick in the 2016 Draft. After a solid summer debut- the Mets sent Dunn straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League for his first full season and he struggled a bit there- finishing the final month of the season on the disabled list.  Pure stuff-wise- Dunn was just fine with St. Lucie. His fastball was consistently in the 93-95 mph range and he was able to reach back for more on occasion. His slider can serve as a true out pitch- flashing plus with good late bite. As a reliever- he hadn't worked on his changeup much- and it's behind the other two pitches- but he does show feel for it. He'll need it to get lefties out- something he struggled with last year. Dunn is athletic and repeats his delivery fairly well- but he had command and control issues throughout 2017.  A certain learning curve was to be expected- given Dunn's lack of starting experience- though being shut down at the end of his first season didn't help quiet detractors who worried about his size and durability. He still has the stuff to start and has the chance to wipe the slate clean. If starting doesn't work out- he certainly should impact the back end of a big league bullpen.,,,,,|,1718,74,185,|,NYM,nym,NYM,,,1st rd 2016,Boston College,,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,45,55,,,,40,55,50,45,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,45,50,55,,,,45

After a slow start to his pro career in the Gulf Coast League- Vientos started to swing the bat well and even earned a late promotion to the Appalachian League. One of the youngest players in the 2017 Draft class- he has considerable offensive upside. With bat speed and strength- Vientos has the chance to hit for average and power and the pop that wasn't there consistently during his senior year- showed up in the GCL. There can be some swing and miss- but when he got hot in August- his strikeout rate plummeted. Though he has below-average speed and lacks range- his arm and hands make him a better shortstop than expected- though most see a full-time move to third in his future.  Vientos played both spots on the left side of the infield during his debut and the good news is it looks like his bat will profile just fine at the hot corner should that become his permanent home. He's just 18 for all of the 2018 season- so there's plenty of time for him to hone his offensive craft.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ax1yE3rIWCs?autoplay=1,,|,2105,76,185,|,NYM,nym,NYM,,,2nd rd 2017,American Heritage HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,50,30,30,55,45,55,60,30,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,30,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

He emerged as one of the more promising young hurlers in the low Minors two years later- garnering All-Star honors with Class A Wisconsin en route to a promotion to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in July. Diplan struggled in 2017 in his return to the that level- as he once again showed promising stuff- but also less feel for it than he did the previous year.    An undersized right-hander with an electric arm- Diplan pitches with a fastball that sits 92-96 mph with late movement and at times scrapes a few ticks higher. He complements his heater with a plus slider- and he has surprisingly advanced feel for throwing a changeup. Having previously shown solid control of his three-pitch mix- Diplan regressed with his strike-throwing ability and overall feel for pitching in 2017. He still missed his share of bats- but also issued 71 walks -- second most in the Carolina League -- over 125 2/3 innings to finish with career-worst walks-per-nine rate of 5.08.    Diplan's struggles in 2017 were a product of inconsistent mechanics- as he all too often failed to stay on line with the plate and repeat his delivery. Club officials believe those issues were tied to his physical development- and the hope is that he'll get back on track once he better understands the limitations of his more physically mature frame. Diplan still has a chance to reach his ceiling as No. 3 or 4 starter if he can do so- though a move to bullpen appears increasingly likely.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/FoG4Cw6p5B0?autoplay=1,,|,28,72,170,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2013 - TEX,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,,55,,,,40,60,50,,60,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,45,,60,,,,40

Eased into the professional ranks as the Rays often do with their young hurlers- Franklin impressed during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and built upon that performance in 2017 while helping to pace Class A Short Season Hudson Valley to a New York-Penn League title.   Franklin is physically mature for his age- with a body that's built for starting games but also requires further projection. A good athlete with a clean arm action- he's been clocked up to 95 mph with his fastball and sits comfortably in the low 90s with heavy sink- and scouts like his chances of adding more velocity. His power 11-to-5 curveball has late bite and the makings of a plus pitch- and he's made strides in improving his changeup since entering the professional ranks. Franklin's control will require further refinement- but he has all the physical tools to become a strike-thrower with all three pitches.  With a blend of size- stuff and pitchability- Franklin looks like a future mid-rotation starter- perhaps more.

Full Report:  This spring- Wilcox surprised scouts who were not expecting him to be such a polished- zone-pounding pitcher. Wilcox is a good athlete who repeats his (non-traditional) delivery and has plus control- but you can't project his stuff to improve much because his frame is maxed out. On the bright side- his stuff is already plenty good- sitting 92-94 with above average life most days- and running up to 98 mph in a heavily-scouted playoff matchup with Kumar Rocker that Wilcox ended up winning. Wilcox also has a nasty- plus changeup that he'll use even against poor prep hitters that can't catch up to his fastball- and his changeup moves so much they still can't hit it. His slider was an above average to plus pitch in the summer and- with a slightly different grip this spring- the pitch has been more average to slightly above. It's still effective against right handed hitters. Wilcox will need a slight delivery adjustment to fix his direction to the plate but otherwise- along with Cole Winn- offers something close to a finished product that just needs to make small improvements. Some scouts pick apart Wilcox's delivery and arm action but there's some cognitive dissonance there as both are better than Casey Mize's and Wilcox- right now- looks something like what Mize looked like a year ago. There's plenty of teams showing lots of interest in the 10-20 range and the rumored $3 million price tag will likely be met.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Ethan Hankins and Kumar Rocker were the marquee names among Georgia high school pitchers entering the year- but Wilcox joined them on the Team USA pitching staff that won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup last September and has surpassed them both this spring. He outclassed Rocker and even homered off him in a state 4-A playoff game in May- cementing his place in the first round. He has the best chance of the trio of developing three solid pitches.  Wilcox's fastball already sits at 92-95 mph and reaches 98 with heavy sink and the promise of more velocity once he fills out his athletic 6-foot-5 frame. His 82-87 mph changeup is equally effective- featuring fading action and often bottoming out at the plate. He'll also unleash a plus slider at 82-85 mph- though it's not quite as consistent as his other two offerings.  Wilcox repeats his mechanics well and has advanced feel for pitching. His delivery and arm action aren't as smooth as those of Hankins and Rocker- but his stuff is so good he has won over teams leery of taking high school pitchers in the first round. If he follows through on his commitment to Georgia- he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2020.,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/mUKE04zP5UU?autoplay=1,|,2397,77,220,|,,,,,,,,,|,Heritage HS GA,Georgia,Heritage (Ga.)

He rebounded in his return to the Class A Peoria the following year- when he finished ninth in the Midwest League in batting average and tied for third in stolen bases. Sierra built on that success in 2017- beginning the season in the Class A Advanced Florida State League before jumping to the Major Leagues in May. He ultimately batted .317 over parts of 22 games (and four stints) with St. Louis- which then dealt him to the Marlins in December with Sandy Alcantara- Zac Gallen and Daniel Castano as part of the Marcell Ozuna trade.    With his knack for making consistent- hard contact and his well-above-average speed- Sierra has the raw ingredients to become a future top-of-the-order-type hitter- and he stands to solidify that profile even more with a more refined approach and improved on-base skills. Sierra will never offer over-the-fence power but has enough strength to hit the gaps- with his speed enabling to him to routinely take extra bases. He receives high marks for his baserunning- though his ability as a basestealer leaves something to be desired. Sierra is an elite-level defender in center field- the kind who regularly makes highlight-reel plays- and he has a plus arm to boot.    While he doesn't have the ceiling of Miami's other recently acquired outfielders like Lewis Brinson and Monte Harrison- Sierra- with his four average-or-better tools- certainly has the highest floor.

ETA 2018.,Scouting Grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 60 | Overall: 45  Allen made a name for himself at San Diego State with his speed- defense and on-base skills- but it was his untapped offensive potential that prompted Cleveland to select him in the sixth round in 2014. He made strides in his first full season before breaking out in 2016- when Allen led the Minors in runs scored (119)- tied for fifth in steals (45) and paced all Indians farmhands in on-base percentage (.416) while reaching Double-A. Although his progress stalled a bit in 2017 due to a two-month stint on the disabled list for broken hamate bone in his right hand- Allen still made his Major League debut in September and impressed enough to land a spot on the Tribe's postseason roster.   The switch-hitting Allen has everything teams covet in a potential top-of-the-order hitter- as he consistently puts the ball in play from both sides of the plate- shows an advanced approach with strong on-base skills and knows how to utilize his plus speed once on base. And while he has well-below-average power- Allen does show occasional pop from the left side. A Minor League Gold Glove Award winner in 2016- Allen is a gifted defender in center field with range for days and solid arm strength.   Currently blocked by Bradley Zimmer in center field- Allen's clearest path to playing time in Cleveland could come at an outfield corner. A lack of power suggests Allen is better suited for a fourth-outfielder role- but there's something to be said about Allen's track record of surpassing expectations throughout his career.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LxBcGF2Ep_Q?autoplay=1,,|,848,72,175,|,CLE,cle,CLE,,,6th rd 2014,San Diego State,,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,50,20,40,60,50,55,55,30,40,60,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,30,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,

Sandy Alcantara has since been traded to the Marlins while Fernandez's momentum has stalled a bit after two extended stays in the Class A Advanced Florida State League.  It's not that Fernandez was awful in Palm Beach in 2017; he just didn't dominate the way someone with his premium stuff should- and he was shut down at the end of July with some arm tenderness as the Cardinals decided to err on the side of caution. He still has one of the best fastballs in the system- one that reaches 99 mph- and he can combine it with a changeup that flashes plus. Two things holding Fernandez back are his lack of a consistent slider and a lack of command. His breaking ball is developing- but it's fringe-average at best right now- and he'll predictably rely on his fastball-changeup combination to get outs when he needs to. His control comes and goes- leading to elevated walk rates- while his lack of feel for pitching hasn't allowed him to miss as many bats as he should.  Fernandez will pitch all of 2018 at age 21- so there is time for him to turn his projection into performance. There's a chance he ends up in the bullpen- but he'll continue to start to work on all of his pitches and get more innings.,,,,,|,1458,73,180,|,STL,stl,STL,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2014 - STL,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,60,,40,,,,40,60,70,,45,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,70,55,,45,,,,45

Things really started to click in the Appalachian League in 2016 and he made a successful move to full-season ball that included a Midwest League All Star nod in 2017.  Diaz's value lies in his offensive potential from the left side of the plate. Over the past two seasons- he's shown an ability to make consistent contact and drive the ball to all fields. He has tremendous raw power that he is still learning to tap into and it has been really encouraging that he has kept his strikeouts low and hasn't sold out to try to hit the ball over the fence. A below-average runner- Diaz will be a first baseman only and should be capable enough to not be a liability there.  As long as Diaz continues to watch his conditioning and continues to refine his approach at the plate- he should fit the profile of a run-producing first baseman in the future.

The Brewers gave the right-hander a $1-108-000 bonus as the No. 55 overall pick- and Ponce quickly rewarded the organization by pitching well at Class A Wisconsin in his pro debut. A right forearm strain suffered early in 2016 led to a two-month disabled-list stint- and Ponce was ineffective when he finally took the mound. Fully healthy in 2017- Ponce finally furthered his development- pitching well over 22 starts (3.38 ERA) with Class A Advanced Carolina and then finishing his season on a high note in Double-A.    Listed at 6-foot-6- 265 pounds- Ponce has an imposing presence on the mound. He's sacrificed some of his velocity for better command- though he still sits comfortably in the low 90s and at times higher- with an upper-80s cutter enables him to effectively attack left-handed hitters under the hands. His changeup is below average because he throws it too firmly- albeit it with fastball-like arm speed. His curveball- though still slurvy at times- has improved as a professional and receives average grades from evaluators. He throws all four pitches for strikes- and knows how to utilize his height to drive the ball down in the zone.    Ponce's strikeout rate backed up in 2017 as he focused on throwing more quality strikes and working deeper into games. While he still needs to refine his secondaries and fastball command- as well as answer some lingering questions about his durability- Ponce has all the ingredients needed to become a big league starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/EVHsAoCDRas?autoplay=1,,|,1168,78,240,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,2nd rd 2015,Cal Poly Pomona,,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,50,,55,,,45,60,45,50,,60,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,45,50,,55,,,50

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 55 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    The Braves like pushing their young high school arms to full-season ball the season after they are drafted- and they've done so with positive results of late. The hope was that Muller- to whom they gave an above-pick value bonus of $2.5 million in the second round of the 2016 Draft- would follow that model- but he wasn't ready to make the jump- instead spending his second summer of pro ball in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.    Since Muller became a pro- his stuff had been down- with a dip in velocity. Much of that- the Braves believe- was due to a mechanical breakdown in his delivery: His arm had gotten too straight overhand- instead of a more comfortable three-quarters slot. He started showing a little more life to his fastball- closer to what he showed pre-Draft- near the end of his season with Danville- with the hope he's on his way back to sitting at 92-93 mph- in the same ballpark as fellow lefty Joey Wentz. His breaking ball regained some of its shape- showing some good downer action with tight spin- and his changeup showed glimpses of depth. When he's right- he uses his 6-foot-6 frame very well on the mound.    Not every pitcher can follow the same exact development path- and Muller may greatly benefit from not being pushed too aggressively. His move to full-season ball will be a good test to see how far he's come.,,,,,|,1715,78,225,|,ATL,atl,ATL,,,2nd rd 2016,Jesuit Prep HS (TX),,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,,50,,,,40,55,50,,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,,,,,50

There are the pitchability guys- with Jaime Barria- Griffin Canning- Jesus Castillo and Jose Suarez leading the charge. Then there are the higher upside guys- led by Chris Rodriguez. Soriano- after a very strong United States debut in 2017 in the rookie-level Arizona and Pioneer Leagues- fits firmly into the latter camp.    Soriano- signed for the modest sum of $70-000 in March 2016- has one of the most electric arms in the system. His fastball averaged just over 93 mph in 2017 and touched 96-97 mph at times- and there's reason to believe there could be more in the tank as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. His fastball-curve combination is one of the best two-pitch combinations in the organization- as Soriano can really spin his breaking ball- which flashes plus at times. His changeup is his third pitch- but there is confidence it can eventually be an average offering.    Soriano has already put on good weight and strength- leading to the extra velocity that showed up in 2017. He has a very good delivery that he just needs to work on repeating more consistently- which should lead to better overall command. All the ingredients are there- with patience mixed in- for Soriano to grow into at least a mid-rotation starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/oHZqJGlxrbg?autoplay=1,,|,1934,75,168,|,LAA,laa,ANA,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,March 4- 2016 - LAA,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,30,50,,,,,40,60,50,55,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,65,45,50,,,,,45

All he has done has hit since then- across two levels of A ball with the Nats before getting dealt to the A's in August 2016- then in Double-A with Oakland- before getting traded again- this time to St. Louis this past December.  Schrock has shown his approach from the left side of the plate works wherever he's at in the lineup. In his first two-plus seasons of pro ball- he had a .324 average and a .372 on-base percentage- with his .321 average and .379 OBP in 2017 each good for second in the A's system and in the top five for both in the Texas League. He's walked nearly as much as he's struck out- managing the strike zone extremely well and utilizing excellent bat speed to drive the ball. He even has some surprising power- given his size- with double-digit home runs a possibility in the future.   A second baseman only because of his fringy arm strength- he does have solid enough range and hands to profile well there defensively. That- combined with his skill with the bat- point to the kind of overachieving college performer who finds his way into a daily big league lineup in the near future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/nFXynNq4h0g?autoplay=1,,|,1358,68,180,|,STL,stl,STL,,,13th rd 2015,South Carolina,,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,50,20,40,50,50,40,55,30,40,50,50,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,40,50,45,50,|,,,,,,,,

After the season- the Rays added the right-hander to their 40-man roster.   Chirinos lacks a plus offering but knows how to get the most out of his three-pitch mix. He'll operate at 92-94 mph with his fastball- imparting sinking action that nets him plenty of ground-ball outs- and he does a good job of keeping hitters off balance with a slider that has vastly improved in the last two years- as well as a changeup that he throws with late fading action.  Plus control and command are Chirinos' greatest strengths- as he's consistently around the zone with his entire arsenal- seldom issues walks and knows how to induce weak contact early in counts.

The Yankees took him in the second round and signed him away from an Arizona commitment for late first-round money ($2-497-500).    After working at 88-92 mph in 2016- Sauer now operates with a 92-95 mph fastball and touches 97- and he maintained his improved velocity through instructional league in the fall. He also showed some power with both a curveball and a slider as an amateur- and New York will have him focus going forward on his tight curve- which has the upside of a plus pitch. His changeup will require more work because he seldom used his as an amateur.    Sauer has the size for durability and the athleticism to throw strikes and make adjustments- so the Yankees envision him becoming a mid-rotation starter.

A funny thing happened on the way to his predicted failure: He stumbled in his first year with the Phillies after coming over in the Ken Giles deal- but then he adjusted and dominated two levels in 2017- leaving him knocking on the big league door.  Despite that fringe-average stuff- Eshelman still managed to finish fourth in the system in ERA in 2017 while amassing 150 innings along the way. His fastball typically scrapes 90 mph- though he can reach back for a 92-93 mph on occasion. He's tightened up his slider some so it approaches average and he throws his fringy curveball and solid average changeup at will at any point in the count. No one throws more strikes than Eshelman- with a career 1.6 walks-per-nine rate that was lowered thanks to his 1.1 BB/9 in 2017.

Drafted back in the Competitive Balance Round B of the 2014 Draft- Wilson was brought along slowly- spending parts- if not all- of his first three summers playing at rookie levels. Then it started to click in 2017 as Wilson may have made a larger step forward than anyone in the system.  All of those extra at-bats at the D-backs complex have paid off and Wilson has one of the best approaches at the plate of anyone in the system- drawing enough walks to finish second in the Midwest League in on-base percentage. He's starting to make more consistently hard contact and while his thin frame might be somewhat limited in how much strength he can add- there's enough in there to believe he'll get to Major League average power. He runs well enough to steal bases and cover plenty of ground in the outfield.  Wilson has the tools to play center as he continues to improve defensively- but as he matures he might move to right- where he could be a plus defender. The complex is now in his rear-view mirror as he starts moving up the ladder in earnest.,,,,,|,729,75,175,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,2nd rd 2014,JSerra HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,30,20,45,60,45,50,50,45,50,60,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,60,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

His bat-to-ball skills helped carry him all the way to Triple-A in 2017- with the fact that it comes in a middle infielder package only helping his value.  Newman has put up very low strikeout rates wherever he's been- making consistent contact to all fields. His walk rate took a hit at the upper levels in 2017- though he still has a career .340 on-base percentage heading into the 2018 season. The high contact rate has come with almost no power and it doesn't appear likely that it will ever be a big part of his game. He's not a burner- but has enough speed to swipe a few bases and give him solid enough range to stay at shortstop.  He's never played anywhere but short with the Pirates and has been steady- if unspectacular- defensively there. Jordy Mercer is in his way in Pittsburgh- so Newman will have to wait for a trade or for Mercer to leave via free agency to get a crack at the premium position in the big leagues- all while looking over his shoulder at Cole Tucker.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/3UO8or3lTT8?autoplay=1,,|,1139,73,180,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,1st rd 2015,Arizona,,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,50,20,40,55,40,50,60,30,40,55,45,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,30,55,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

He's played all over the infield- seeing considerable time at shortstop -- his original position -- third and second base. In addition- he's now been traded twice. He went from the Jays to the D-backs in the August 2015 Cliff Pennington trade. Two years later- Arizona sent him to the Tigers in the deal for J.D. Martinez.  The D-backs had moved Lugo primarily to third base after he spent most of his first few seasons playing short. When the Tigers got him- he started at third- got a few games in at short and then moved to second at the end of the season. The organization liked what that looked like and had him put in work there during instructs and now thinks he has the chance to stick there if he can continue to improve his footwork- even if his plus arm looks better at third. Detroit also liked what it saw with Lugo's bat. He makes a ton of contact- and it's often loud- with a chance to be an above-average hitter. While he's been hit over power in his approach- there is raw pop there- with 15-homer seasons a bar he could clear.  If Lugo isn't penciled in as an everyday third baseman- there is less pressure on his bat. The Tigers think he could end up being a solid offensive-minded second baseman when all is said and done- knowing he could contribute as a bat-first utility man if the need arises.,,,,,|,766,72,190,|,DET,det,DET,,,J2 2011,Dominican Republic,July 3- 2011 - TOR,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,45,40,60,40,45,,55,45,60,40,50,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,40,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

He led the organization in wins- WHIP and batting average against in his first full year- then topped the leaderboard in ERA and BAA in 2016. He was a little more uneven at the start of 2017- his first full year in Double-A- but finished on fire and was seventh in the system in ERA and second in strikeouts.  A durable starter who topped 140 innings in 2017- Gomber thrives by mixing his three pitches well- getting ahead and keeping hitters guessing. His fastball comes in at about 90-92 mph- but it plays up when he commands it well. His curve has come along so much that it's a plus pitch- thrown with good shape in the strike zone- and he mixes in a solid average changeup very well. Gomber ran into some trouble in Double-A when he wasn't commanding the ball in the zone as consistently as he had previously- but he made adjustments and posted an ERA under 1.00 in August.  As long as he can continue to stay in pitchers' counts- Gomber will be successful. His ceiling might be limited to that of a backend starter- but if he can command the counts- he can keep being successful at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/HSGVqNK8rZo?autoplay=1,,|,864,77,230,|,STL,stl,STL,,,4th rd 2014,Florida Atlantic,,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,50,,,,,45,45,50,55,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,50,60,,,,,55

That includes an All-Star nod for his first full year in full-season ball in 2017. A minor back injury kept him from getting bumped up to Ft. Myers at the end of the year- but he's good to go for another step up in 2018.  Blankenhorn has consistently shown the ability to swing the bat from the left side of the plate. He makes loud contact with the ability to drive the ball and an uptick in power in 2017 is a good sign for the future that he could be at least Major League average. A tireless worker- he has improved his overall approach and understands his gameplan at the plate much better than he had when he started. He's a fringy runner- but a strong baserunner and is more athletic than you'd think.   Blankenhorn split time between second and third in 2017 and the Twins would like for him to continue to see time at both infield positions- though that might depends on who is on the roster with him.

The Pirates got their man a year later in the Mark Melancon deal that also netted them current closer Felipe Rivero.   Like Rivero- Hearn is a hard-throwing lefty with a premium fastball. He can throw it in the 97-98 mph range with regularity and can reach back for more on occasion. He has a very good feel for his changeup- an offspeed pitch that now flashes plus at times. But his third pitch- a slider- is below average. He has some feel to spin a breaking ball- but has struggled to find the right grip or the right type of shape for it- lacking the confident to throw it often enough. His control is another obstacle. While he misses bats and gets groundball outs- he also can pile up the walks- which limits his effectiveness and leads to questions about whether he can continue to start.  Hearn missed time in 2017 with an oblique injury- but made up for it by throwing well in the Arizona Fall League. His ability to refine his command and his breaking ball might determine his ultimate.

The trouble is he's had a hard time staying off the disabled list- with a back issue that cut short an otherwise successful 2016 season- a shoulder impingement that delayed the start to his 2017 and Tommy John surgery in July that will likely cost him all of 2018.  Szapucki has the makings of a very effective three-pitch mix when he's healthy. His explosive fastball is electric with plus life and he throws it in the 92-97 mph range. His power breaking ball can be a second plus pitch which freezes hitters and misses bats. There's a solid changeup in there as well- one with terrific fade and sink- though it was less consistent than the other two offerings. He has a deceptive delivery with a slightly lower arm slot that can add to his effectiveness. His command comes and goes at times as he struggles with his direction to the plate.  Szapucki is plenty young enough to come back and continue his climb up the Mets ladder- though his injuries have allowed him to throw just over 83 pro innings since being drafted. If he can come back and show he can stay healthy- he has the stuff to contribute to a big league rotation- following a Steven Matz-like comeback path.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/aaIRseQiZNU?autoplay=1,,|,1314,74,181,|,NYM,nym,NYM,,,5th rd 2015,Dwyer HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,40,60,,,,,40,60,50,60,,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,45,60,,,,,45

The Cubs landed him and Addison Russell as part of their package for Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel in July 2014- then spun him with three other players to the Yankees for Aroldis Chapman two years later. He went into a long funk at the plate after fracturing his kneecap in August 2015 but snapped out of it by batting .306/.336/.541 with 10 homers in Triple-A in the last two months of 2017. McKinney made his big league debut in 2018- but he was sent to the disabled list after one game with a sprained left shoulder joint.  McKinney's best attributes are his smooth left-handed swing- bat speed and hand-eye coordination. He demonstrated a disciplined approach at lower levels of the Minors but his Triple-A hot streak came when he got more aggressive at the plate. Scouts who believe his late-season surge is for real see his upside as a .280 hitter with 20 homers per year- though he attained that average just once while topping out at 16 homers in his first four full seasons.  McKinney broke into pro ball as a center fielder and has spent most of the last three years as a right fielder. He's just a decent athlete with average speed and fringy arm strength- so he's best suited for left field.

Ankle and hamate injuries ruined his first two full years as a pro before he ranked fifth in the low Class A South Atlantic League with 16 homers in 2017 -- though that season ended two weeks early when he punched a dugout door in frustration and broke his left pinky.  Adolfo has two exceptional tools in his raw power and his arm. His combination of bat speed- strength- loft and leverage in his right-handed swing gives him massive pop to all fields. He still needs to make more consistent contact- though he improved last year when he started to recognize pitches better and became less pull-conscious.  Adolfo has the best arm strength among Chicago's position prospects- further enhancing his right-field profile. He has average speed and should be an average defender on an outfield corner.

A left-handed hitter- Wall makes consistent contact from the left side of the plate and delivers line drives to all fields. He hasn't shown much extra-base power yet- though Colorado still believes he can produce double-digit homer totals as he continues to add strength. His speed earned some double-plus grades when he was an amateur- but it's more plus now and he still has much to learn as a basestealer.  Wall tore the labrum in his throwing shoulder in high school- leaving him with a below-average arm that was a liability at second base. He also led California League second basemen with 32 errors in 2016- prompting the Rockies to try him in center field in instructional league and make him a regular outfielder last year.

That's even true for someone like Hill- who grew up around the game with a father- Orsino- who played and is now a scout. But the Tigers' 2014 first-rounder has had trouble gaining any traction as injuries -- a quad injury in 2015 and Tommy John surgery in late 2016 -- have kept him off the field almost as much as he's been on it.  Hill- who will be 22 for all of the 2018 season- is still plenty young enough to be an impact player. Defensively- he could play in the big leagues right now. He's as good a center fielder as anyone in the organization and can flat out get the ball wherever it's hit. Before the elbow injury- it was a plus arm- and there's hope it will be better than average again in the future. Hill can use his speed to steal bases as well- but the question has always been- and continues to be- if he'll hit and get on base enough to use that speed. He's continued to work on his bunting to help and he has added some physical strength.  More than anything- Hill needs to stay off of the disabled list so he can work on refining his offensive game. He can change the game in the outfield and on the basepaths. If he can hit at all- he can be a dynamic everyday up-the-middle player.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZObNf_dt9Wg?autoplay=1,,|,810,74,190,|,DET,det,DET,,,1st rd 2014,Elk Grove HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,35,20,45,70,55,50,50,45,50,70,60,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,30,70,50,60,|,,,,,,,,

Injuries- a concussion and a right wrist issue in 2016- then a thumb problem that ended his season in July in 2017- have severely hampered his ability to move forward- though the Reds were pleased with his progress before he was shut down last season.    At the time of his season-ending injury in the Midwest League- Stephenson was keeping pace with Reds breakout prospects Taylor Trammell and Jose Siri in many respects- all while learning the nuances of catching. He has the chance to carry an average hit tool with above-average power by the time he is big league ready. He has legitimate raw pop and his improvement in his approach at the plate- drawing more walks- will only allow him to tap into it more consistently. He has a strong arm at the plate that he hasn't fully learned to use well to control the running game- though he has made strides with his footwork and release.    The most important thing for Stephenson at this point is to get in a full- healthy season.

ETA 2022.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 30 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 65 | Overall: 50    After dazzling at shortstop during his prep career- Allen was widely revered by scouts as one of the 2017 Draft's premier defensive players. But with his slight build and perceived signability concerns- Allen remained somewhat of a wild card when the Draft finally arrived. The A's- undeterred in spite of those concerns- selected the California prep in the third round and then lured him away from his USC commitment with a $2 million bonus- more than double slot value ($697-500) for the No. 81 overall pick. Assigned to the Rookie-level Arizona League for his pro debut- Allen continued to draw raves for his defense but also raised questions about his offensive upside.    There is no doubt among scouts that Allen can stick at shortstop. He's already a plus defender there as a teenager- with outstanding range that leads to many highlight-reel plays- and plus arm strength that allows him to make throws from all over the diamond. On the other side of the ball- the jury is still out regarding Allen's upside with the bat. While he shows good feel to hit and bat-to-ball skills- Allen desperately needs to add strength to his undersized frame in order to consistently impact the baseball. He's a plus runner with outstanding instincts- knows how to play small ball and is aggressive on the basepaths.     Allen endears himself to scouts even more with his outstanding makeup and baseball IQ. His supporters see a Jose Altuve-type profile- albeit one with at least two full grades less power who relies more on his glove than bat to impact games.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LdNKp8Xs1s0?autoplay=1,,|,2054,69,155,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,3rd rd 2017,Francis Parker HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,20,50,45,60,50,30,30,50,60,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,30,60,60,65,|,,,,,,,,

ETA late 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45  After a certain point in time- when a prospect continually outperforms his tools- you have to start believing it's legit. While Wade was just a ninth-round pick in 2015 after an injury-interrupted junior year at Maryland- he just keeps on producing- including an All-Star turn in the Double-A Southern League in 2017. He was playing well in the Arizona Fall League to cap off his year when he suffered a concussion in an outfield collision- though he is expected to be 100 percent for 2018.  Wade is a bit underrated because he doesn't have one tool that jumps off the page. His biggest skill is his ability to control the strike zone and he's walked more than he's struck out in his pro career. That plus some solid bat speed has led to hitting for a high average. He hasn't hit a ton of homers- but there is some pop from the left side and the Twins think he might be able to leverage the baseball a little more to tap into that raw power. He has decent speed and has shown the ability to play all three outfield spots.  If the extra-base ability comes around a bit more as he's knocking on the big league door- he could end up surprising people and becoming an everyday guy- best suited for left field. Even if he doesn't- a solid career as a productive fourth outfielder awaits.,,,,,|,1908,73,189,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,9th rd 2015,Maryland,,|,,,,,|,STL,0.500,XXX,|,40,30,45,50,50,40,50,40,45,50,55,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,55,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

A breakout in 2014 in the New York-Penn League gave the Mets confidence he could handle a double-jump to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in 2015- but elbow issues and eventual Tommy John surgery limited him to just over 40 innings and forced him to miss all of the 2016 season. He did have a solid return- pitching mostly in Double-A in 2017.  Molina's stuff did back up a bit during his return season- though he was still effective. His fastball that used to touch 95 mph- was more in the 91-93 mph range- though he threw it with good sink to induce groundball outs. His slider- which flashes above-average- and his changeup- an average offering- also weren't quite as sharp- but he showed enough glimpses for there to be confidence they'll be back to pre-surgery form in the future. He continued to be a serious strike-thrower- with his 2.2 walks per nine rate right in line with his career mark.  The Mets are hopeful that with a full year removed from the elbow surgery and time away from the mound- Molina's stuff will come all the way back. If it does- he could easily reach his potential as a No. 3 type starter.

He's the older brother of the Yankees' Justus Sheffield- one of the game's best left-handed pitching prospects. Jordan hasn't progressed as quickly as his sibling because shaky command has limited his effectiveness.  All three of Sheffield's pitches can elicit swings and misses when he can steer them close enough to the plate to elicit swings. He can carry a mid-90s four-seam fastball into the late innings and reach 98 mph as a starter- though it's fairly straight- which has led him to fiddle with a two-seamer as well. He has a hard three-quarters breaking ball that would be more effective if he got ahead in the count more often to set it up- and a circle changeup that he should use more often.  The Dodgers are trying to smooth out Sheffield's mechanics to help him locate his pitches more efficiently. They still haven't given up on him as a starter- though the gulf between his stuff and his pitchability may point him to the bullpen.

ETA 2021.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Viewed by scouts as arguably the best all-around shortstop prospect in the 2016-17 international class- Antuna impressed across the board as a Dominican amateur with his five-tool potential and overall feel for the game. It led to him being ranked as MLB Pipeline's No. 17 international prospect- and the Nationals landed the then-16-year-old in July with a $3.9 million bonus- a franchise record for an international amateur- in July. That price tag was supported by Antuna's strong pro debut in the Rookie Gulf Coast League- where he showed impact potential at the plate as part of a loaded Nats GCL squad.   The switch-hitting Antuna is more polished at the plate than Washington's other 2016-17 international signees. He does most of his damage from the left side- where he exhibits preternatural barrel ability and consistently drives the ball with a leveraged swing. It's for that reason that scouts believe Antuna- who shows present pop to the gaps- ultimately could develop average over-the-fence power. Antuna also receives praise for his plate discipline as well as his pitch recognition- both of which fuel an approach that belies his age. Presently an above-average runner- Antuna is likely to lose a step as he physically matures.  Defensively- Antuna displays soft hands and good body control at shortstop- where his strong arm is also a clean fit. He was prone to defensive lapses at both short and third base during his pro debut- and some evaluators believe he'll eventually land at the hot corner on account of his modest defensive actions.,,,,,|,1582,72,170,|,WSN,was,WAS,,,J2 2016,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2016 - WSH,|,,,,,|,CIN,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,40,55,40,55,50,45,50,50,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,55,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

Cruz was 6-foot-1 when he was first being scouted- then was 6-foot-4 by the time the Dodgers signed him in 2015. By 2016- when he began his pro career- he had grown to 6-foot-6. His tremendous ceiling was on display with a move from the Dominican Summer League up to full-season ball in 2017 and the Pirates noticed- acquiring the gangly infielder in the Tony Watson deal last July.  Most of Cruz's upside comes in his power. He's more power over hit right now- and the ball jumps off of his bat. He has leverage and twitch at the plate- with plus game power not out of the question if he can get stronger and learn to control his body. His swing isn't overly long- but it does get out of control from time to time. Zone discipline will be a big area of focus as a refined approach will allow him to tap into that power more consistently. Cruz was a shortstop who moved over to third primarily in 2017- though some feel he has a chance to defy expectations and play up the middle. Cruz runs well and has a very strong arm- so a corner outfield spot might be his eventual home.  Cruz will be just 19 years old for all of 2018.

That hasn't been because of a lack of performance. Quite the contrary: Quinn has been dynamic- more often than not- when he's been on the field. The main issue has been his inability to stay there- as a number of injuries have kept him from playing more than 100 games in any one season- the most recent one a damaged UCL in his non-throwing elbow that didn't require surgery.    Quinn is still one of the fastest men in baseball- with true 80 speed on the 20-to-80 scale- with four seasons of 30 or more steals- all the more impressive considering how oft-interrupted they have been. His overall approach at the plate has changed as he's learned the importance of drawing walks and getting on base and while power is never going to be a huge part of his game- he has the strength to impact the ball enough to be a solid average hitter. He is a plus defender in the outfield with a strong arm.    While most of Quinn's injuries have been unrelated to each other- he did change his routine this offseason in order to try to maximize health. He's ready to contribute in the big leagues and while it might have to be as a part-timer at first- he still has the ability to be an everyday center fielder at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/LXasZ4rclQQ?autoplay=1,,|,409,70,170,|,PHI,phi,PHI,,,2nd rd 2011,Port St. Joe HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.650,2nd,|,50,30,45,80,55,50,55,30,45,80,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,30,80,55,60,|,,,,,,,,

Potts finished with an even 20 homers- 14 of which he hit during a torrid second-half stretch that also saw him slash .278/.325/.512 over 65 games.   Potts has a knack for making hard contact at the plate- with a quick right-handed bat and plenty of strength to his frame- though there is some swing-and-miss to his game. He projects as fringe-average hitter- but scouts expect him to develop at least average power as he continues to add strength. San Diego drafted Potts as a shortstop but has since shifted him to third base- where he shows the necessary hands- footwork and arm strength for the position.  Potts has proved to be more advanced than expected early in his career- most notably in his capacity to make adjustments and get to his power during games. Though he'll need to tighten his approach and clean up his defensive some- Potts appears on the right path towards becoming a future middle-of-the-order third baseman at the highest level.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/snj4NTnQVAc?autoplay=1,,|,1749,75,205,|,SDP,sd,SD,,,1st rd 2016,Southlake Carroll (TX),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,50,50,45,55,45,50,55,45,55,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,45,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

Despite the year off- Lopez returned to the mound with a strong showing in the Rookie-level Arizona League- and then was even more impressive during his full-season debut at Class A Clinton. A move up to the hitter-friendly California League in 2017 resulted in some early struggles for Lopez- but the right-hander made noticeable strides in each month before being dealt to the Marlins in July in the David Phelps trade. After the season- Miami added Lopez to its 40-man roster.   Lopez lacks a plus offering but has proven effective with an average three-pitch mix for which he shows excellent feel as well as present command. His fastball sits in the low 90s with good sinking action that generates a plethora of weak ground balls. He keeps hitters off balance by effectively mixing his heater with a slider and a changeup- both of which receives average grades from evaluators.  Lopez's pitchability is driven by plus command that has resulted in 1.2 walks-per-nine in 333 2/3 career innings. That- along with his potential for improved stuff as he matures- give the right-hander a chance to be a back-end starter in the big leagues.,,,,,|,2273,75,200,|,MIA,,MIA,,,J2 2012,Venezuela,July 4- 2012 - SEA,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,50,50,,,,,50,55,55,50,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,50,50,,50,,,,60

A product of the Dominican Republic- Garcia ranked No. 9 on MLB Pipeline's list of the Top 30 international prospects for the 2016-17 signing period before signing with Washington for $1.3 million. He lived up to expectations during his impressive pro debut in the Rookie Gulf Coast League- as evaluators raved about the teenager's present combination of hitting ability- speed and defense.  Garcia has a knack for making good contact across the entire field using a quick- hands-y swing from the left side of the plate. Scouts believe he'll drive the ball more consistently with better incorporation of his core and lower half in his swing- and there's plenty of room left for Garcia to grow in to his projectable frame. A plus athlete who is a near plus-plus runner- Garcia proved an adept baserunner during his pro debut and should continue to pile up stolen bases during his ascent of the Minor Leagues.   A sure-handed shortstop with quick feet and clean actions- Garcia has enough range to make all the routine plays- with plus arm strength that's a fit anywhere on the infield. He'll only get better as he gains experience- too- and there's little doubt among evaluators regarding his ability to stick at either middle-infield position.,,,,,|,1574,72,190,|,WSN,,WAS,,,J2 2016,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2016 - WSH,|,,,,,|,TAM,1.750,V,|,20,20,45,55,45,55,45,40,50,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,65,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

In 2017- Littell showed his feel for pitching would work at the upper levels- pitching well for both the Yankees' and Twins' Double-A affiliates while topping 150 innings for the second straight season and finishing an astounding 19-1. His walk rate did spike a bit following the trade- but there's confidence he'll return to the guy who has walked just 2.2 per nine innings in his pro career. His fastball is average velocity-wise- in the low-90s- but it plays up because of his command and life. His curve flashes plus and is his best secondary offering and his changeup gives him a third at least average offering. Littell mixes his pitches well and gets a ton of groundball outs.  Littell's ability to work ahead and command the ball is the key to his future success.

He got to wipe the slate clean via a trade for Rob Whalen and Max Povse- moved behind the plate and took a big step forward in reclaiming his prospect status by smashing 19 home runs in the Braves system before adding five more in the Arizona Fall League.    Jackson no longer profiles as the plus pure hitter some envisioned when he was coming out of the Southern California ranks- but that might be OK because of his sheer strength. He tends to muscle up on his swing too much- so seeing him hitting for average is a long shot- but he has unlocked his plus raw power and can hit the ball out of any park. Seeing him hit .240 with 25 homers doesn't seem horribly unrealistic. Jackson bought into returning behind the plate and worked tirelessly at it- with the experience in the AFL sure to be invaluable. He has plenty of arm strength- but it's erratic- with a slower release. His receiving has improved because of his efforts- and the Braves believe he'll stick there.    Sometimes all that is needed is a reset button- and Jackson hit it in a big way.

That's continued since he joined the Reds courtesy of the Mike Leake deal at the 2015 Trade Deadline- though he did make his big league debut in 2017.    Mella still has an electric fastball- one that touches 97 mph at its peak. He can couple it with a power breaking ball that he's done a better job of landing for strikes and can serve as an out pitch. His changeup will flash above-average at times- but like with the success of him using his impressive arsenal- it hasn't been consistent. He threw more strikes in 2017- but was hit more and didn't miss as many bats as he should given his stuff.    For years- there's been talk about moving Mella to the bullpen because of his power arsenal and overall command issues. It might be time to make that move- in which case he could impact the big league relief corps soon.

Griffin (No. 28) spent most of his first two full pro seasons getting pounded in Class A before improvements in his stuff and confidence helped him win Kansas City's Minor League pitcher of the year award in 2017.  Griffin earned a $1-925-000 signing bonus because he projected as a polished starter with the potential for three solid or better pitches. But his fastball seemed stuck in the upper 80s in 2015 and 2016 before jumping to 89-91 mph and topping out at 93 last year. He added velocity and sharpness to his curveball as well while maintaining his effective changeup.  Griffin doesn't have a plus pitch and he's going to have to keep hitters off his improved- but still average-at-best- fastball. When he's on top of his game- he locates his heater on both sides of the plate and fills the strike zone with his entire arsenal.

His combination of tools and polish earned him a $2.5 million bonus from the Astros in 2015. He made his U.S. debut at age 17 in 2016 and held his own as one of the youngest regulars in the Rookie-level Appalachian League last year.  Celestino has done nothing to dispel the Albert Almora comparisons that started when he was an amateur. They're both skilled center fielders with strong arms and instincts that stand out more than their pure speed- and their hitting ability is more promising than their power potential. The biggest difference between the two is that Celestino is less physical- and he still needs to prove he can make enough impact at that plate to become an everyday player in the big leagues.  A rare player who bats right-handed but throws left-handed- Celestino has a handsy stroke that sprays line drives to all fields.

The Rays took notice of the right-hander's development and acquired him from Minnesota as part of the Kevin Jepsen deal at the Trade Deadline in 2015. Hu continued to excel against older hitters in his first year with the Rays- earning Double-A Southern League All-Star honors as well as a chance to pitch for the World team in the SiriusXM All-Stars Futures Game in July. Added to Tampa Bay's 40-man roster after the season- Hu made his big league debut as a reliever in April 2017- his first of six bullpen appearances with the Rays.  Hu operates in the low 90s with late life but shows consistent plus velocity in shorter bursts. His changeup is a plus pitch as well as his best secondary weapon- one he throws against hitters on both sides of the plate- and he's adept at mixing in a legitimate palmball. Hu also has a curveball and a slider- the latter flashing above-average potential with cutter action.  Though he lacks physical projection- Hu has proved plenty durable as a starter throughout his career.

That's a big reason why the Cardinals were excited to get him in January in the Randal Grichuk deal.  The Cardinals are not alone in thinking that there's still a lot to work with with Greene- despite his rough season in Double-A a year ago. A pure projection pick out of high school- Greene has filled out his 6-foot-3 frame and how has a premium fastball that sits in the mid-90s with ease and touches triple digits at times. When he is throwing well- he throws downhill and with sink to elicit ground ball outs- but too often the heater has flattened out of late- leading to him being more hittable than he should be. So does his lack of consistent secondary stuff. Both his power breaking ball and his changeup will show glimpses of being average- if not better- but an inability to repeat his release point has made it tougher for him to throw them effectively and has resulted in surprisingly low strikeout rates.  Command is still a huge issue for Greene- with his 83 walks in 2017 placing him sixth in all of the Minors.

The Australian lefty was humming along the lower levels of the Minors when an elbow injury shut him down late in 2014 and led to Tommy John surgery in the spring of 2015. He missed all of that season and when he came down with mono as he was rehabbing in 2016- that season was lost as well. He did return and throw well enough in 2017 to get added to the 40-man roster in the offseason.  Thorpe is getting back to the starting pitching prospect with a four-pitch mix he was looking like before the injury and illness setbacks. His fastball will sit in the low 90s- touching a tick more at times- with solid command of it. His changeup is his best secondary weapon- an above-average offspeed pitch thrown with good sink. His two breaking balls are distinct pitches- with a tight slider and more of a pure curveball he mixes in effectively. He's generally around the strike zone- and it's easy to see his overall command improving the further removed from the disabled list he gets.  The Twins are looking forward to Thorpe having a full- normal year without any further hiccups. He'll be at the upper levels of the system- still with a ceiling of a Nos. 3 or 4 starter.,,,,,|,1029,73,160,|,MIN,min,MIN,,,J2 2012,Australia,July 12- 2012 - MIN,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,40,50,,,,45,50,50,45,55,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,60,55,50,45,,,,50

He was a potential first-rounder- and the organization gave him a bonus to sign him away from UCLA as if he were one. Money saved to sign No. 1 overall pick Mickey Moniak was used to give the right-hander $3.5 million- but the Phillies will have to wait for the return on that investment as he had Tommy John surgery last August and will miss the 2018 season.    Before the injury- Gowdy ironically stood out for his clean delivery to go along with a very good feel for pitching. His fastball was in the 90-93 mph range with the kind of projectable frame that pointed to added velocity. He complemented the heater with a bit of a hybrid breaking ball that looked headed toward being an above-average slider in time and he has a very good feel for a changeup. He showed acumen for throwing all three for strikes. Seeing him with three above-average to plus pitches with solid command in the future isn't an unreasonable projection.    The goal is to get Gowdy on the mound at instructs in the fall. His previous feel for pitching- combined with the overall success rate of pitchers coming back from this surgery still has the  organization quite bullish on Gowdy's future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vr9lun60EAw?autoplay=1,,|,1723,76,170,|,PHI,,PHI,,,2nd rd 2016,Santa Barbara HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,50,,,,,45,60,50,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,60,50,,55,,,,50

The Royals made him the second backstop taken- selecting him 52nd overall and paying him a well over-slot $2-097-500 to give up a commitment to Florida International- where his father Mervyl is head coach. He lived up to his reputation during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League.  Melendez has more athleticism than most catchers- and it's obvious in all phases of his defensive game. He's a quality receiver who moves quickly to block balls in the dirt- and his footwork enhances his plus arm. Because he grew up around the game- he's a more advanced game-caller than most teenagers.   Melendez creates solid raw power with the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing. His stroke can get too long and uphill- however- leading to a 30 percent strikeout rate in his first taste of pro ball and questions about how consistently he'll produce at the plate. He has close to average speed now- but figures to slow down as he gets bigger and endures the rigors of catching.,,,,,|,2109,73,185,|,,kc,KC,,,,,,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,40,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

After playing sparingly as a freshman- Diechmann erupted to hit 11 home runs the next year- then he blew past that total with 19 homers as a junior before going to the A's in the second round. After signing for $1.7 million- Deichmann showcased his impressive power by hitting eight homers in 46 games as Class A Short Season Vermont's everyday right fielder.    Deichmann's power is his calling card. The big left-handed hitter has impressed scouts with his bat speed and strength dating back to his high school days- and he's shown that he can get to it consistently in the past year-plus after shortening his swing and adopting a more selective approach. Deichmann's improved approach also has helped him in using the entire field- though much of his power remains to his pull side. And while strikeouts will always be a part of Deichmann's game given his power-over-hit profile- he does offset some of those concerns with perennially strong walk rates and on-base skills.    A shortstop in high school- Deichmann saw time at first base at LSU before finding a home in right field- where his above-average arm and power profile are clean fits. He's a below-average runner but moves well underway- and with improved reads and routes- he could become an average defender.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/27ocOVLfiqE?autoplay=1,,|,898,74,190,|,OAK,oak,OAK,,,2nd rd 2017,LSU,,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,60,50,40,55,50,55,60,45,45,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,40,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

He has continued to mash as a pro- smacking 51 homers in his first two full seasons while reaching Triple-A. Unfortunately for him- he's blocked by All-Stars Cody Bellinger and Justin Turner at his two best positions.  With strength and solid bat speed- the left-handed-hitting Rios creates power to all fields that plays against both lefties and righties. Though he's very aggressive and doesn't have much of a game plan at the plate- his hand-eye coordination allows him to make consistent hard contact. He may never walk much- but he can hit for power and average.  Rios has a strong arm but lacks speed and quickness and thus defensive value. He spent most of his first two years as a pro at third base but had limited range and was error-prone. He works hard enough to become adequate at first base- where he saw more action in 2017- when he also looked better than expected if not particularly rangy on the outfield corners.,,,,,|,1655,75,220,|,LAD,lad,LA,,,6th rd 2015,Florida International,,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,45,40,70,20,35,60,55,55,70,20,40,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,20,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

His hopes on following up on a solid 2016 season that saw him reach Double-A for the first time were dashed by a shoulder injury that required surgery- keeping him off the field for all but 23 games in 2017.     Leyba is once again healthy and ready to start working his way up to Arizona. The switch-hitter has a really strong contact-first approach and has greatly improved his plate discipline and willingness to take walks. He may never be a huge power guy- though that tool is often the last to come- but with his new selectivity- he started tapping into his raw power for more extra-base authority and could be a double-digit home run guy in the big leagues. While he's played mostly shortstop- he's shown he can more than handle second base.    Leyba eventually should settle in to being a solid utility player- though if more power comes- seeing him at second every day shouldn't be too surprising. For now- though- he'll focus on staying healthy and putting the shoulder issue in his rearview mirror.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/OYwgNhVUC4w?autoplay=1,,|,728,71,160,|,ARI,az,ARI,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2012 - DET,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,40,50,45,50,60,40,40,45,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,50,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

Then there are pitchers like Herget- who- after three years of effective starting at South Florida- has never started a game since the Reds took him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. It's hard to argue with the results- as Herget has pitched his way up to Triple-A- saving 64 games in the process after leading the organization in saves in 2017.    A big part of Herget's success is his ability to come at hitters from a variety of arm angles- but to label him as a trickster would be doing his stuff a disservice. He can get his fastball up to 97 mph while throwing it from three different angles with a ton of deception. He uses that fastball and his solid slider to miss a ton of bats- while mixing in an occasional changeup for left-handed hitters. While he mixes things up to disrupt hitters' timing- he repeats well and largely throws strikes.    People watch Herget and figure he's a right-handed specialist or a setup man in the future. But he has the makeup to close games- wanting the ball in the ninth inning- and has better pure stuff than he's given credit for.

The Rays were not one of those teams- as they selected Mercado in the second round and then signed him with an above-slot bonus of $2-132-400. The young right-hander proved advanced in his professional debut- making eight strong starts in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.   Tall and lanky with long levers- Mercado's frame is loaded with physical projection. While his fastball typically sits in the 88-92 mph range and reaches 94- he's expected to continue to add velocity as he adds strength- especially in his lower half. Mercado also shows feel for throwing a two-seamer that registers in the upper 80s that has late run and sinking action. He throws a slider with cutter action and a curve- with the latter a much better offering- buckling knees with sharp bite coming from a high three-quarters slot. He does a nice job of sprinkling in his changeup. He can throw strikes with all four offerings.  Mercado already has proved more polished than many of his Draft contemporaries- but the Rays are likely to move him along at a conservative pace as they tend to do with their top prep arms.

He struggled to make progress early in his career- but finally advanced to Double-A Akron in his sixth professional season. Returning to Akron in 2017- Haase rewarded the Indians for their patience with a breakout campaign on both sides of the ball before finishing the season in Triple-A. After the season- the Indians rewarded him with a spot on their 40-man roster.  Haase has long showed big right-handed power- but he didn't get to it consistently until 2017- when he connected on a career-high 27 homers and paced all Indians farmhands with a .578 slugging percentage after making several key adjustments to his swing. Strikeouts will always be a large part of Haase's game- but he does have some hitting ability as well as a solid approach that yielded a career-best walk rate in '17.   Haase's defense- much like his bat- has steadily improved- though questions remain about whether he can catch regularly at the highest level.

While the latter became the first of the duo to reach the Major Leagues- doing so with Oakland in May 2017- Urena received his first taste of the big leagues as a September callup at age 21- appearing in parts of 21 games down the stretch after making the jump from Double-A New Hampshire.  Urena shows good feel for the barrel from both sides of the plate with loose- twitchy wrists and good bat speed. He drives the ball more consistently as a lefty and has hit all but three of his career home runs from that side. He should continue to add power as he grows into his athletic frame- though he'll also be a greater source of gap power than true over-the-fence pop. His right-handed swing is less impactful but yields consistent contact. An overaggressive approach continues to limit Urena from both sides of the plate- resulting in elevated strikeout rates- few walks and a low on-base rates throughout his career.   Defensively- Urena has the athleticism- range and plus arm to continue to profile at shortstop- though his finesse at the position leaves much to be desired- and he still commits too many careless errors- both with his glove and arm.

After once again ranking among the Southeastern Conference's premier starters- he should push his way into the top two rounds.Though Knight is extremely skinny at 6-foot-3 and 165 pounds- he has some power to his fastball- which sits at 90-94 mph and peaks at 97. He also has a mid-80s slider/cutter that qualifies as a plus pitch at its best. He also will mix in an effective changeup and a curveball he can drop in for strikes.  Knight has a quick arm and generates velocity without much effort in a repeatable delivery that allows him to fill the strike zone.

That power-speed combination not enough for the Astros to protect on their loaded 40-man roster- but Martin was not selected in last December's Rule 5 Draft. That made him available to be one of four young players Houston sent to the Pirates in January's Gerrit Cole trade.  Martin is very capable of impacting the ball and making productive hard contact. His improved launch angle and swing plane have led to his increased power numbers of the last two years and point to future pop. He is more power over hit- as he swings and misses quite a bit and his overall plate discipline regressed when he moved to Double-A in 2017. He's also struggled against left-handed pitching for much of his career. Martin has shown he can play all three outfield positions capably- though he does have a below-average arm.  Given the left-right splits and issues with his approach- Martin might best be suited for a fourth outfielder or platoon role at the highest level. If he can get back to working counts better- he could hit his way into a larger role- though his defense doesn't necessarily profile well enough in one spot to stick there.,,,,,|,1250,70,185,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,8th rd 2013,Orange Lutheran HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,40,40,50,50,45,50,50,45,50,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,55,40,50,|,,,,,,,,

He showed off his tools and versatility by hitting 50 homers and stealing 53 bases while playing six positions in his first three full years as a pro- then went to the Brewers at the end of the 2016 season as the player to be named in the Jonathan Lucroy trade. Though his 2017 season ended in late June when he fractured a vertebrae near his neck- the White Sox acquired him for Anthony Swarzak a month later.  Cordell has a chance to develop at least average tools across the board. His bat speed and strength translate into power- and they combine with his plus speed to give him 20-20 potential. His right-handed swing has looked longer and he hasn't controlled the strike zone as well since arriving in Double-A- and how much he hits for average will depend on his ability to make adjustments.  Cordell's quickness also serves him well in the outfield- where he's a solid defender on the corners and average in center. His arm strength helps him fit the right-field profile and also allows him to handle third base- though he's erratic at the hot corner.

As a junior- he established a school record for strikeouts (123) while finishing fourth in NCAA Division I in whiff rate (13.3). Targeting Lowther's bat-missing ability- the Orioles took him with the No. 74 overall pick in the second competitive balance round- and he continued his run of dominance by posting a 1.66 ERA with 12.4 K/9 during his pro debut with Class A Short Season Aberdeen.   Lowther's best pitch is a fastball that sits at 87-90 mph and tops out at 93. It plays well above its fringy velocity- as he commands it well and creates deception by hiding the ball well before generating massive extension to the plate. He's unlikely to throw much harder because he's already physically mature at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds.  Lowther's ability to pitch off of his fastball increases the effectiveness of his above-average curveball and a changeup that ranges from fringy to average. His control is average- with room for improvement- though he does offset many of his free passes with strikeouts. While the effectiveness of his modest arsenal will be tested at higher levels- Lowther's pitchability and knack for missing bats points to a career as a No. 4 starter.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/wVeEOHsnDns?autoplay=1,,|,2150,74,235,|,BAL,bal,BAL,,,2nd rd 2017,Xavier,,|,,,,,|,WAS,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,55,,,,,45,55,50,60,,,,,55,|,,,,,,|,50,50,55,,,,,50

That's particularly true in the case of Burdi- who was initially a second-round pick by the Twins in 2014 after a tremendous career as Louisville's closer. He's had trouble staying healthy- however- missing nearly all of 2016 with an elbow bone bruise and then needing Tommy John surgery in May of 2017. The Pirates thought his arm strength was worth the gamble- sending international bonus money to get him from the Phillies- who took him third in December's Rule 5.  Burdi is rehabbing from surgery and the Pirates are hopeful he can rediscover the nasty power stuff that made him look like a future closer. His fastball sits easily in the upper 90s and has hit triple digits. He backs that up with a nasty plus slider that serves as a true strikeout pitch and can even mix in a changeup against left-handed hitters. Command has been an issue and while hit doesn't have to be pinpoint- his time missed hasn't helped him learn to find the strike zone more consistently.  The Pirates are hopeful he'll possibly pitch again competitively by season's end. Whenever that happens- he'll have to spend 90 days on the big league active roster to get past Rule 5 restrictions.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/a4s7JnQDc9k?autoplay=1,,|,817,77,220,|,PIT,,PIT,,,2nd rd 2014,Louisville,,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,80,,,70,,,,40,80,,,70,,,,40,|,,,,,,|,80,40,,65,,,,40

Signed for $1-282-700 as a second-rounder- Adams entered pro ball with a reputation as one of the most athletic and projectable pitchers in his prep class and posted a 59/4 K/BB ratio in his debut. While he has continued to pound the strike zone- he has plateaued with mostly average stuff.  As a high school senior- Adams displayed a 92-96 mph fastball and the makings of a plus slider. Four years later- he hasn't added much strength and his stuff has leveled off over the course of long pro seasons. He now operates with an 88-92 mph fastball more notable for sink than velocity- and his low-80s slider is solid but never became an out pitch.  While his changeup features some tumble and grades as an average offering at times- Adams still has been easy picking for left-handers. The prep three-sport star still repeats his loose delivery very easily and can provide strikes with all of his pitches- but he won't be more than an innings-eater in the back of a rotation unless he can miss more bats.

The Padres still made Thompson a third-round pick in 2016- taking him 85th overall and then giving him $1.75 million- more $1 million above pick value- to lure him away from a Texas commitment. Assigned to Class A Fort Wayne for his first full season- Thompson missed time early with biceps tendinitis and made just seven starts before shoulder inflammation prematurely ended his campaign in July.   Thompson generates easy velocity when he's healthy- sitting 92-93 mph and reaching 95 mph with a fastball that has arm-side run and should continue to add velocity as he grows into his lanky 6-foot-7 frame. He'll need time to develop his secondary pitches- but he shows the potential for an above-average curveball and a fading changeup which projects for a similar grade.   Thompson's athleticism and clean arm action enable him to throw strikes- though his healthy undoubtedly will remain a major concern going forward.

He struggled out of the gate in 2017- but righted the ship and pitched his way to Triple-A- earning a spot on the 40-man roster.    Words like nasty and filthy are used to describe Miller's stuff. His mid-90s fastball has a ton of life- generating weak contact on a regular basis. His cutter is a plus pitch that puts away hitters and greatly contributed to his 12 K/9 ratio in 2017. He also mixes in an average curveball with good effect. The only thing holding Miller back has been his command. He has struggled with finding the strike zone at times during his rise up the ranks- though he did a much better job of it in Triple-A last year thanks to some tweaks in his delivery.     Miller doesn't have to be pinpoint to be successful in a short relief role.

He led the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League with a 63/3 K/BB ratio in his 2015 pro debut- then ranked fifth in the South Atlantic League with a 104/23 mark the following season- when he was the low Class A circuit's youngest pitching qualifier at age 18. The jump to high Class A didn't go as smoothly in 2017- though he did reduce his ERA from 5.14 in the first three months to 3.79 in the final two.  Raudes lacks a plus pitch and wasn't able to baffle high Class A hitters with his command and deception. His best offering is his fading changeup- which helped him hold left-handers to a .668 OPS last year. But righties teed off on him to the tune of a 1.033 OPS- as his 88-92 mph four-seam fastball- his fringy curveball and new slider weren't able to keep them at bay.   Raudes has to be precise with the location of his pitches in order to succeed- and he wasn't as sharp in 2017. His command helps his fastball play above its mediocre velocity but that wasn't enough to keep it off barrels last year.

Heller had a 91-94 mph fastball as a college starter but now works at 94-97 mph and reaches triple digits. He has a high spin rate on his heater- which helps create late life that makes it more difficult to hit. His 82-85 mph slider can be a plus pitch with depth when he stays on top of it or gets slurvy when he doesn't.    Heller also will mix in a decent changeup against left-handers.

That quickly changed in 2015 during his senior year with reports that he was up to 96 mph with a mid-80s slider. He signed for $300-000 as a third-round pick and had an excellent pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Maese continued to impress the next year- reaching full-season ball at age 19- but was sidelined by shoulder soreness for much of 2017 in his return to Class A Lansing. Maese had surgery in the offseason to address the shoulder impingement- delaying his 2018 season debut.   When he's healthy- Maese can run his fastball into the mid-90s but tends to work more in the 90-94 mph range- displaying feel for pitching to both sides of the plate. The pitch features considerable movement- as Maese's fast arm and low three-quarters slot imparts excellent sinking action that has helped him generate more than twice as many ground-ball outs as air outs in his career. His slider is relatively new to his arsenal but shows the makings of a second average-or-better pitch- thrown with power in the upper-80s- and he's also made strides in developing his changeup since signing.    Maese's athleticism is special- and it's easy to envision the young righty growing into his projectable frame in the coming years- though first he'll need to get healthy.

He has been both overpowering and wild as a pro- leading the Minors in strikeout rate (12.2 per nine innings) and walks (104) in his first full season in 2016 and posted similar numbers last year. He threw more strikes than ever toward the end of the 2016 season but his control and command regressed in 2017- prompting a demotion to Double-A in mid-July.  Staumont misses bats -- and too often- the strike zone -- with both his fastball and curveball. The four-seam version of his heater usually works from 93-99 mph when he starts and has climbed as high as 102 in short stints- and he can run his heavy two-seamer into the upper 90s. His low-80s curve can be an absolute hammer with power and depth.  There are no red flags with Staumont's delivery- yet he can't keep it together enough to throw strikes. It's becoming increasingly apparent that he's destined to become a reliever- though the Royals will continue to give him starter's innings for now so he can work on trying to harness his stuff.

He advanced quickly when he returned to the mound- jumping from Double-A to the Majors in 2016 before the Cubs acquired him in exchange for outfielder prospect Donnie Dewees during the offseason. He barely pitched in his first season with his new organization- making just seven starts while plagued by bone chips in his elbow.    Mills' control and command are more impressive than his pure stuff. He does have a pair of solid offerings in his fastball and changeup- which play up because of his ability to locate them. Both have sinking action and his heater can range from 91-95 mph when he's fully healthy.    Though Mills throws two distinct breaking balls in a curveball and slider- they're fringy and don't make right-handers uncomfortable.

The Rangers took him in the third round and paid him late first-round money ($2 million)- only to have to shut him down again when his elbow bothered him three innings into his 2016 pro debut. They kept him on a short leash in 2017- gradually building his pitch count up to 90- and viewed the year a success for him because he stayed healthy and worked 75 innings.  When he was 100 percent in college- Matuella sat at 93-97 mph with his fastball- missed bats with his curveball and slider and showed feel for a changeup. He reclaimed most of his fastball velocity last year and flashed a plus curveball and changeup. Texas took away his slider in 2017 but will allow him to throw it again this season.  Matuella throws strikes with a streamlined delivery but hasn't regained his command- rendering his stuff more hittable than it should be. It's possible to still dream on him becoming a frontline starter- but some scouts think it's more realistic to make him a reliever and expedite him to the big leagues.

He was throwing well at instructs last fall- but 2018 will be the first time he throws competitive professional pitches in his career.    Kay looked very much like the typical quick-to-the-big-leagues college lefty- one with decent stuff and a good feel for pitching- during his final season at UConn. He might sit in the low 90s- but he was up to 96 mph during instructs. His changeup gives him a second at least above-average pitch- an offspeed offering that misses bats because it has good action to it. He can spin a breaking ball- and though it was fringy in college- his pitchability makes some feel it will be an average pitch eventually.    The 2018 season will largely be about getting back on the mound and through his first pro season healthy.

Blewett hasn't added velocity since turning pro- yet his fastball remains effective in the low 90s with a peak of 96 mph because it sinks and he uses his 6-foot-6 frame to deliver it on a steep plane. His high three-quarters arm slot also helps him stay on top of his mid-70s curveball- a second solid offering. He has improved his changeup- which shows flashes of becoming an above-average pitch but also can be too firm at times.  For a big- young pitcher- Blewett repeats his delivery well. His athleticism helps him throw strikes- though he still must refine his control because he's fairly hittable.

One of the best shortstops in a 2017 Draft notably thin at the position- Seise is well equipped to stick at the position. He has the quickness- soft hands and strong arm for short- as well as keen instincts to go with his physical gifts.

Ellis got off to a good start- but tailed off in the second half.  Ellis was teammates with No. 4 overall pick Brendan McKay- but it was Ellis who led Louisville in batting average- home runs and RBIs in 2017. He has the chance to hit for average and power and did so in the beginning of his debut before he struggled. He has easy raw power to all fields and has shown some feel to hit. He managed his strikeouts for the most part in college- drawing walks- and that carried over in Hillsboro before he started to press and got out of his approach. Coming out of school- there were concerns about his defense- with some thinking he'd eventually move to first- but the D-backs were pleasantly surprised with how he handled the hot corner and don't have concerns about his future there.  For Ellis to reach his potential as a power-hitting third baseman- he'll have to make sure he makes enough contact to tap into that power.

In 2017- he was a different player completely- leading the organization in steals- raising his batting average more than 60 points- playing well in the Arizona Fall League and earning a spot on the 40-man roster.  The move seemed to free his mind as he re-worked his swing and was able to focus on his offense. It came together rather quickly- with him making more consistent contact as a result of improved bat speed and much more extra-base authority than he'd ever shown previously. He does need to continue to refine his approach and get into hitter's counts more consistently- which would give him more opportunities to tap into that raw power. A plus runner with a plus arm- he has transitioned to center field seamlessly and is a plus defender who looks like he was meant to roam the outfield.

He did make it to Double-A as a starter in his first full season- though a neck strain shelved him at the end of the year. Moved to the bullpen for 2017- the injury bug hit again and Jay missed most of the season- though he did make up for some lost time in the Arizona Fall League.  The Twins are cautiously optimistic that Jay is starting to find the pitcher he was before the injuries hit. When Jay first got to the AFL- he seemed tentative and afraid to let it fly- with a fastball that was touching the low 90s. In his final outing of the fall- however- he was up to 94-96 mph and felt great about how he wrapped up a lost season. His slider- while still flashing plus- is still a bit inconsistent and he still throws his curve and changeup- with the chance to be more than two-pitch reliever.  There is no longer any talk of having Jay start- as his slight build clearly was not suited for it- and there's hope that the clarity in role will help him mentally prepare.

He missed the rest of that season but recaptured his power stuff in Double-A last year.  With a pair of pitches that grade as well above average at their best- Ferrell could become a closer if he can find some more consistency. His fastball usually ranges from 93-98 mph with late life and his mid-80s slider has two-plane break and can be more unhittable at times.

Because he has a high-tempo delivery and lapses into bouts of overthrowing- Ferrell's control and command never have been as sharp as his stuff.

Targeting college arms- the Orioles made Akin their second-round pick that June- and he immediately impressed the organization during his pro debut with Class A Short Season Aberdeen. Making the jump directly to Class A Advanced Frederick for his first full season- Akin pitched to mixed results early before settling in during the second half.   Akin's repeatable delivery and clean arm action allow him to paint both sides of the plate with a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and reaches 96. His go-to secondary offering is a short- above-average slider in the low 80s- and he also demonstrates feel for a changeup that could be at least average. He throws each of his three pitches for strikes- and club officials rave about how he attacks the inner-half against right-handed hitters.  Akin's initial struggles in the Carolina League prompted the Orioles to give him two-week break in late May to correct his mechanics. An adjustment to Akin's heel placement on the rubber did the trick- as it allowed the southpaw to stay more in line with the plate and better execute his pitches. Akin could develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter if he continues down his current path- though there's also a non-zero chance he ends up in the bullpen.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/RKnbSobB0dk?autoplay=1,,|,1770,72,225,|,BAL,bal,BAL,,,2nd rd 2016,Western Michigan,,|,,,,,|,TOR,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,55,,45,,,,45,50,60,,50,,,,50,|,,,,,,|,55,50,,55,,,,50

He was sent to the Braves in December 2014 as part of the Justin Upton trade and had a bit of a breakout offensively in 2016- though a hamate injury forced him out of the start of 2017 and seemed to negate any power gains he had made.    Now 100 percent healthy- Peterson- who was not protected on the 40-man roster and not taken in the Rule 5 Draft- can show that he's more of the 2016 version of him. That was the year he set career highs in just about every offensive category and took a big step forward in terms of tapping into his raw power. At his best- he mitigates a reasonable amount of strikeouts with a fair walk rate- especially given his power potential. An infielder originally- he was moved to left field and he's a whole lot more natural there than he was at third base- projecting as an average defender with a fringy arm.    Peterson deserves a mulligan for his lost 2017 season and should get a chance to show who he really is in 2018.

They were attracted to his work behind the plate and his intangibles- traits that led them to promote him to the short-season Northwest League for his U.S. debut last summer. He was the league's best defensive catcher as an 18-year-old and showed more offensive promise than his .228/.266/.338 line might indicate.  With his agility and soft hands- Amaya is an advanced receiver for a teenager- framing and blocking pitches well. His arm strength is average but plays better than that because he makes quick and accurate throws- and he erased 41 percent of basestealers in the NWL. His arm strength has improved since he has signed and he could be a plus thrower once he's fully developed.  Amaya has yet to make the same type of impact at the plate- but he has feel for the barrel and makes contact from the right side of the plate.

They didn't fully turn him loose until 2017- when he ranked first in ERA (2.87)- second in opponent average (.246) and third in strikeouts (140 in 122 1/3 innings) in the high Class A California League at age 20. He stands out as easily the best left-hander in a system that has been short on southpaws since Julio Urias graduated to Los Angeles.  Ferguson added velocity to his fastball last year- sitting in the low 90s and peaking at 95 mph- and hitters still had trouble squaring it up even though it didn't feature quite as much sink as it had in the past. He gets swings and misses with his upper-70s curveball- which can become a plus if he lands it in the strike zone more consistently. He's gaining more trust in a fading changeup that should be at least an average third offering.  Though Ferguson's walk rate jumped from 0.7 per nine innings in 2016 to 4.0 last year- it should settle somewhere in between. He has the athleticism to repeat his delivery and grew more comfortable attacking hitters once he got accustomed to the hitter-friendly Cal League. If he can refine his command- he has a good chance to become a No. 4 starter.,,,,,|,2024,75,215,|,,lad,LA,,,,,,|,,,,,|,SEA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,,,,,50

He turned down the Braves as a 37th-rounder in 2014 to attend Wake Forest- where he led NCAA Division I with 84 RBIs and the Atlantic Coast Conference with 21 homers (both the second-highest totals in school history) last spring. Signed for an over-slot $2 million in the second round- he held his own in low Class A during his pro debut.  While Sheets is strong and physical at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds- there's also some polish to his offensive game. He has a smooth left-handed swing and made strides with his pitch recognition and plate discipline in 2017. He's still going to be more slugger than hitter- however- and some scouts question whether he has enough bat speed to punish big league fastballs.  Sheets moves well for his size yet still has well below-average speed. He has worked hard on his defense and gets the job done at first base- his only option besides DH. He has soft hands and a strong arm that works well on 3-6-3 double plays.,,,,,|,2050,76,230,|,CHW,chw,CWS,,,2nd rd 2017,Wake Forest,,|,,,,,|,HOU,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,70,30,40,50,50,55,70,30,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,35,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

The Astros scout Oklahoma junior colleges as hard as anyone and made him one of their six 2014 Draft picks from that demographic- signing him for $15-000 in the 34th round. He advanced to Double-A but didn't do much else to distinguish himself in his first four pro seasons before taking a step forward in his fifth.  James credits his jump to addressing his sleep apnea two offseasons ago- and he dedicated himself to conditioning last offseason and was the most improved Astros prospect in Spring Training this year. After working with a 92-94 mph fastball in the past- he's now sitting at 94-96 and reaching 98. He's also generating ground balls at a much higher rate than before.  Beside his fastball- James also throws a slider that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch and a decent changeup. He doesn't repeat his delivery consistently- so he may not provide enough strikes to remain a starter.

He reached Double-A for the first time in 2016- the same year that he was dealt with Harold Ramirez and Francisco Liriano to the Blue Jays at the Trade Deadline. Sidelined with a left oblique injury for much of the first half in 2017- McGuire performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and then made up for lost time in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason.  McGuire's defense has long been his calling card- and there's little doubt that it will get him to the big leagues. An excellent blocker and receiver who garners high praise for his game-calling and his ability to handle a staff- McGuire also is adept at controlling the running game with his plus arm and efficient pop technique. At the plate- McGuire continues to show natural hitting ability with a level- line-drive producing swing and advanced feel for the zone- and he even showed an uptick in power in 2017- connecting on a career-high six home runs with Double-A New Hampshire despite playing in just 34 games.   McGuire's stock as a hitter seemingly is on the rise now that he's healthy. His glove- meanwhile- is good enough for him to carve out a role as defensive-minded backup- if not a regular in the big leagues.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/R-7ft9EA2ac?autoplay=1,,|,118,71,215,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,1st rd 2013,Kentwood HS (WA),,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,45,20,45,30,50,55,55,35,45,30,60,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,35,45,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

After passing on his commitment to Texas Christian to sign for a below-slot $950-000- he burst into pro ball with 14 hits in his first five games. He finished third in the Rookie-level Arizona League batting race at .339 and played better defense than expected.  Though Gonzalez had some of the best right-handed raw power among high schoolers in the 2017 Draft- he just focused on making quality contact in his debut. He showed advanced pitch-recognition skills- controlled the strike zone and used an inside-out swing to drill line drives from gap to gap. As he gets stronger and turns on more pitches- he should start producing more home runs.  While Gonzalez is a below-average runner with modest arm strength- he does have soft hands and San Francisco believes he can stay at third base if he improves his footwork.

He has yet to complete a fully healthy pro season while dealing with ankle and elbow injuries that didn't require surgery and a torn meniscus in his knee that did. After coming to the White Sox last July as part of a package for Todd Frazier- David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle- he strained an oblique in his first start and missed a month.   Clarkin's downer curveball looked like a future plus pitch when he was in high school- and while it's not as sharp now it's still his best offering. His two-seam fastball has slipped a notch to 88-92 mph- though it still comes with plenty of sink. His feel to spin also shows up with a slider that's nearly as effective as his curveball- and his changeup gives him yet another solid secondary pitch.  If Clarkin can stop missing time and start building up arm strength over full seasons- he might regain some velocity and develop into a mid-rotation starter. His control and command help his cause- as he generally throws strikes and keeps the ball down in the zone where he's less hittable.

The Pirates loved his advanced approach at the plate and took him with the 22nd overall pick- in the first round. In his first year-plus as a pro- he's controlled the strike zone well- as expected- but the power many hoped to see has yet to materialize.  The Pirates- for their part- are not overly concerned with that part of Craig's game. They see a first-round pick who went straight to a pitching-friendly Florida State League for his first full season and turned in a solid performance. Craig does hit for average and draws a ton of walks -- his career on-base percentage of .386 speaks to that -- and there is some confidence he'll start tapping into his raw power up a level in the Double-A Eastern League. He's a below-average runner with limited range defensively who is now a first baseman only after seeing time at both infield corners at the start of his career.  That defensive limitation does put more pressure on his bat. He's going to have to step it up a notch- particularly in terms of driving the ball and run production- if he wants to develop into an everyday player at first base.,,,,,|,1624,75,212,|,PIT,,PIT,,,1st rd 2016,Wake Forest,,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,40,30,55,30,40,60,55,40,55,30,45,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,35,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

That was especially true since he was immediately moved from behind the plate- where he played at the University of Virginia- to first base. He did make his way to Double-A in his first full season and capped things off with a stint in the Arizona Fall League.    Thaiss utilizes an advanced approach at the plate to see a lot of pitches and draw walks- leading to a system-best 77 free passes in his first full season and a .375 on-base percentage. That- combined with a contact-oriented philosophy- should allow him to hit for a high average- and it was encouraging that he performed better in that category after his move up to Double-A in 2017. There are concerns that Thaiss won't have the power to fit the first base profile- but there is more pop for him to tap into and he sees value in knocking out 30 doubles annually while trying to get on base at a 40 percent clip- a pace he was keeping up in Double-A.    Thaiss has continued to work on his defense at his new position- something he prioritized in 2017- and he should be capable there.

He jumped on a fast track by going from A ball to Double-A in his first full season and had advanced to Triple-A in 2017 when he blew out his elbow in June and needed Tommy John surgery.    When healthy- Weigel has four pitches that he can go to in order to get hitters out. He'll pitch at 93-94 mph with his fastball typically- but he can reach back for 97-98 mph when he needs it. On any given night- one breaking ball is better than the other- and he's more than willing to toggle back and forth based on which one he has a better feel for. He'll often throw a true curve early in counts to get ahead- and the slider becomes more of a strikeout pitch. He'll mix a solid average changeup in as well and he's generally around the strike zone with all of them.    The hope is that Weigel will be back before the season is over- though it really will be 2019 before he's at full strength.

He missed the entire 2014 season- but he has stayed healthy since- allowing him to get all the way to Triple-A in 2017. The Twins rolled the dice and did not put him on the 40-man roster in the offseason- making it possible for the Angels to take him in the Rule 5 Draft. The right-hander got into eight big league games before being sent back to Minnesota in late April.    A lot of things clicked for Bard- the younger brother of former big leaguer Daniel Bard- at the upper levels of the Minor Leagues in 2017 and he used his fastball-slider combination to miss more bats than he had any previous point in his career. From a pure velocity standpoint- Bard's 94-95 mph average fastball is a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale- but it can play up because it has plus riding movement and spin. His slider is a potential plus pitch- a mid-80s power breaking ball. He missed bats during his Major League audition.    Being able to stay on the mound- Bard's overall command has improved and certainly helped fuel his breakout in 2017.

The game didn't come as easily to him as expected during his first full pro season- though he did rally to bat .299/.370/.455 in the final eight weeks in low Class A.  Lux's overall .244/.331/.362 line last year led to mixed reviews about his offensive potential. His proponents point to his bat speed- deceptive strength and control of the strike zone and think he can hit for average with double-digit home run totals. Others are more skeptical of his left-handed swing and think he gets too passive to do much damage.  Lux has the solid speed and the savvy to steal 20 bases per year- though there are diverging opinions as to how well that quickness translates to his defense. He has reliable hands- but he can look more stiff than athletic at shortstop.

It was the fourth round of the 2010 Draft that Kingham was plucked from the Las Vegans prep ranks- to be precise- but Kingham dropped from the radar because of May 2015 Tommy John surgery. He did return in the second half of 2016 and pitched all of 2017 in Triple-A.  The Pirates were happy that Kingham largely got a full- healthy season in after his year was initially delayed by an ankle injury- knowing that some dead arm periods were to be expected. He was a little timid in the first half- especially in throwing his above-average changeup- the pitch he blew out on in 2015. His command came back just fine- though he was too hittable at times. He throws his low-90s fastball downhill- getting a fair amount of ground-ball outs while his curve is solid average and that changeup has very good sink.

The right-hander led the Southern League in strikeouts (168) and walks (90) in 2015- but trimmed his walk rate by over a batter-per-inning the next year in Triple-A- all the while maintaining an impressive strikeout rate. Officially moved to the bullpen ahead of the 2017 season- Schultz spent the first three months on the disabled list after suffering a groin injury in his season debut. He returned to the mound late in July 2017 and performed well back in Triple-A.   Schultz has power stuff that misses bats consistently- a notion supported by his 11.6 strikeouts-per-nine in 40 career appearances at the Triple-A level. The right-hander will reach 98-99 mph with his fastball but usually sits in the mid 90s with considerable arm-side run- maintaining his velocity deep into starts. He pairs his heater with a power breaking ball that piles up whiffs with its depth and bite- and he also throws a fading changeup. After issuing 6.0 walks-per-nine in 2015- Schultz has trimmed his walk rate in each of the past two seasons- though he still falls behind in the count too often.   Schultz has all the ingredients to serve as a late-inning force out of the bullpen- a role that allows him to better utilize his two plus pitches without having worry about throwing strikes or working deep into games.,,,,,|,1465,70,200,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,14th rd 2013,High Point,,|,,,,,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,,60,,,,,40,55,,60,,,,,40,|,,,,,,|,65,45,,60,,,,45

He missed a couple of weeks in 2015 with a hip injury- two months in 2016 with a sprained elbow ligament and another two months last year with oblique issues.  When healthy- Martin can deal with a pair of plus pitches: a low-90s fastball that reaches 95 mph with some cutting and tailing action- while his curveball combines power and depth. He didn't surrender a home run to a left-hander in his first four pro seasons but needs to improve his sinking changeup so he can counteract right-handers. He'll occasionally mix in a slider/cutter as a fourth offering.  Martin uses his height and high three-quarters delivery to add plane and deception to his pitches. He has made strides with his control and command since turning pro but regressed in both areas last year.

He had one of the best pure arms in the 2016 Draft but lasted 63 picks because he rarely could harness it- and Texas invested a $1-024-900 bonus to see if they it help him reach his lofty ceiling. He went 0-6 with a 10.89 ERA in seven starts at short-season Spokane in 2017- then didn't allow an earned run and struck out 29 in 14 2/3 relief innings.  Speas has an explosive 92-96 mph fastball that already pushes triple digits and has riding life- and he could throw harder if he adds more muscle to his lanky frame. He also can show a wipeout breaking ball with curveball depth and slider velocity- though he has difficulty landing it in the strike zone. He has little experience throwing a changeup and figures to scrap it if he winds up in the bullpen.  The Rangers haven't given up on Speas as a starter and hope he can gain some confidence from his success as a reliever and during instructional league. His athleticism and clean arm action should help him throw strikes- but he has trouble keeping all of the moving parts in his delivery in sync.

Assigned to Class A Advanced Frederick for his first full season- Sedlock never rebounded after a shaky start- while a pair of stints on the disabled list for a strained flexor mass in his right elbow limited his time on the mound.   Sedlock's velocity was down during his time in the Carolina League- but he still showed a consistent 91-93 mph fastball that featured sink as well as some arm-side life. Sedlock's curveball is his go-to secondary offering- flashing above-average potential- and he'll also show some feel for an average changeup as well as an inconsistent slider in the low 80s. The effort in Sedlock's delivery combined with his longer arm stroke led to control issues in 2017- though the Orioles believe that will be less of an issue going forward after having him return to his college mechanics.   Thought of as a lock to remain a starter out of the Draft- Sedlock now has much to prove after his underwhelming full-season debut.

He tied for the Rookie-level Arizona League lead with six triples in only 32 games and ranked fourth in the short-season Northwest League with eight homers in just 23 contests- a tantalizing power display for an 18-year-old middle infielder. Pitchers exploited his free-swinging ways when he first got to low Class A in 2017 before he settled down and batted .280/.336/.460 in the second half.  Though he's just 5-foot-11- Tejeda has wiry strength that combines with his quick hands to give him plus raw power. He's learning that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs- and when he does his whippy left-handed swing gets too long and he piles up strikeouts and harmless flyballs. If he develops more patience and uses the entire field- he could hit for a decent average while still hitting 15-20 homers on an annual basis.  Tejeda has more than enough arm for shortstop but his speed and range are average- so it's unclear if he'll stay at the position. He's too young to move yet- though he did see extensive action at second base last year and has played sporadically at third base in the past.

Throughout his career- Granite has been aware of what kind of player he is- one who gets on base and uses his speed well on both sides of the ball. He makes a lot of contact- rarely striking out- and will draw walks for excellent on-base numbers and can steal a base. While power will never be a big part of his game- Granite did work with Triple-A hitting coach Chad Allen in 2017 to leverage the ball more to potentially get to more extra-base impact.

Sherfy showed exactly what he's capable of doing over the last couple of years after struggling in Double-A back in 2015. He misses a ton of bats- largely with a two-pitch mix. The athletic reliever goes right after hitters with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and often touches higher- backing it up with a breaking ball that misses a ton of bats and serves as a true out pitch.

He logged one inning back in Triple-A the following year before undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery- and the Yankees designated him for assignment that November. Re-signed by New York to a Minor League deal before 2017- Rumbelow returned to the mound in June and pitched well enough across the Double- and Triple-A levels that the Yankees felt inclined to add him to their 40-man roster in November. It wasn't long thereafter that they dealt him to the Mariners in exchange for JP Sears and Juan Then.  Rumbelow has three effective pitches- each of which grades as at least above-average. His best offering is his fastball- which sits at 92-94 mph- reaches 96 and plays up thanks to the deception created by his over-the-top release point and long arm action. He throws his curveball with power and depth in the low 80s- along with a changeup in the mid-80s that features splitter-like tumble. Rumbelow can miss bats with his entire arsenal and has thrown more strikes as a pro than was expected of him coming out of LSU.   That the Mariners traded a pair of promising young arms for Rumbelow underscores their belief in him as an impactful big league reliever.

True to projections- Yerzy's bat is starting to show up- and then some. Now it's a question of whether his catching can keep up.  After struggling during his pro debut in 2016- Yerzy showed the ability to make adjustments- see pitches and start tapping into his considerable raw power. He drew walks and drove the ball to all fields in the Pioneer League in 2017 and if that continues- his plus raw power will show up more consistently in games. Defensively- Yerzy has solid arm strength- and has thrown out just over 30 percent of potential basestealers in his young career heading into 2018- but his receiving- blocking and game-calling still have a ways to go.    The D-backs are pleased with the strides he's made defensively and he reported to Spring Training with a transformed body- looking much leaner and more athletic.

Before he got hurt- Schmidt tied up hitters with a 92-94 mph fastball that reached 96 and featured heavy sink. Both his curveball and slider were plus pitches at times but lacked consistency- and New York may have him focus on one breaking ball when he returns to the mound. He also had a decent changeup with some tumble.    Schmidt had no issues throwing strikes in college- though he tended to get hit when he didn't keep his pitches down in the zone.

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 50 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Chatham led Florida Atlantic to its first-ever Conference USA regular-season title in 2016- winning accolades as the league's player and defensive player of the year while playing through a broken hamate in his right hand. The Red Sox made him the highest pick in Owls history- signing him for $1.1 million as the 51st overall choice- but haven't gotten to see much of him yet. The hamate injury hampered him during his pro debut- while repeated hamstring issues limited him to just eight games in 2017.   Though he's just an average runner and taller than most shortstops at 6-foot-4- Chatham shouldn't have to move from shortstop. His instincts and quick first step improve his range- and his strong- accurate arm allows him to make all of the throws. If he winds up shifting to second base- he still should provide enough offense to profile as an everyday player.  Chatham has a track record of making consistent line-drive contract from the right side of the plate- though he could use some more patience to draw more walks. His size gives him good leverage and more raw power than most shortstops- and he could produce 30 doubles and 12-15 homers annually. He won't steal many bases but is an effective runner.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/o51fk4q6VrI?autoplay=1,,|,1731,76,185,|,BOS,bos,BOS,,,2nd rd 2016,Florida Atlantic,,|,,,,,|,MIN,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,45,50,50,60,45,40,45,50,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,50,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 45 | Run: 50 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  The Cubs used two of their first three 2014 Draft picks on bat-first college catcher/outfielders: Kyle Schwarber (first round)- who accepted the challenge of trying to stay behind the plate- and Zagunis (third)- who wanted no part of it. He quickly became a full-time outfielder and established himself as the most disciplined hitter in the system. He boosted his stock by beginning to drive the ball more often in 2016- though he went 0-for-14 in his first taste of the big leagues last year.  Zagunis recorded a .402 on-base percentage through his first four seasons in the Minors because he sees pitches so well and has uncanny control of both the barrel and the strike zone. He concentrates on drilling line drives from gap to gap and doesn't worry about hitting home runs. He has ordinary bat speed and a flat right-handed swing- yet still could hit 12-15 homers per season because he makes so much hard contact.  While Zagunis has average speed and arm strength- he's just a fringy defender on the outfield corners. He needs to work harder on his routes to get to balls more quickly. He's more of a second-division regular than an everyday player for the Cubs- though his on-base ability could make him useful off the bench.,,,,,|,910,72,215,|,CHC,chc,CHC,,,3rd rd 2014,Virginia Tech,,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,50,30,50,50,40,50,55,40,50,45,40,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,50,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

He led the Minors with 45 doubles and 74 extra-base hits in 2015- then went 8-for-18 in a brief stint with Colorado. He spent most of the previous two seasons in Triple-A- smacking a career-best 26 homers in 2017.  At 6-foot-4- Patterson has a naturally long left-handed swing but he worked to shorten it when he entered pro ball. He developed a line-drive stroke that didn't take full advantage of his strength and bat speed- then added more loft to his swing and put more balls in the air last season. The added power enhances his profile as a potential regular in the big leagues.  Patterson primarily played right field while seeing sporadic time at first base during his first four pro seasons before spending most of his time at first in 2017. He's a capable defender at either spot and his strong arm fits well in right.

Graduating to full-season ball in 2016- Cabrera earned mid-season All-Star honors in the Class A Midwest League at age 19- though he did wear down physically late in the season. He continued to make developmental strides in 2017- beginning the season in the Florida State League and then moving up to Double-A at the midseason mark- pitching well at both stops.   Though he's thinly built- Cabrera has a live arm that produces easy velocity in the form of a 92-95 mph fastball with late life that has been up to 97 in the past. His slider registers in the mid- to high-80s- thrown with late- short slicing action that gives it a cutter-like feel- and he also has the makings of an advanced changeup that aids his effectiveness against right-handed hitters. What's more- the young southpaw is adept at changing hitters' eye levels from an over-the-top release point- though some scouts worry about his ability to create favorable downhill plane given his height.  That Cabrera already repeats his delivery well bodes well for his chances of remaining a starter- especially with so much physical projection remaining in his wiry frame. He has the arsenal and control profile to develop into a big league starter- although his fastball-slider pairing also gives him a bright future as a reliever- one who is particularly effective against same-sided hitters but also capable of recording outs on both sides of the plate.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/sKhWIR1ZYYA?autoplay=1,,|,1867,73,170,|,TBR,tb,TB,,,J2 2013,Dominican Republic,Nov. 11- 2013 - TB,|,,,,,|,LAN,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,55,45,,40,,,,30,55,55,,45,,,,40,|,,,,,,|,60,45,,55,,,,50

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 40 | Arm: 55 | Field: 45 | Overall: 45  Dozier was a surprise No. 8 overall pick in 2013- taken in part to save bonus pool money for supplemental first-rounder Sean Manaea- but also because the Royals saw Dozier as a legitimate first-rounder. His career stalled when he got to Double-A midway through his first full pro season and started selling out for power- though he rebounded with a more moderate approach in 2016. After making his big league debut that year- he was poised to get regular at-bats in Kansas City in 2017- but never appeared for the Royals and appeared in just 33 Minor League games because of an oblique strain and a hamate injury.  Dozier got back on track when he recognized that he had enough strength and loft in his right-handed swing to produce at least average power without focusing on home runs. Though he tried to do too much at times in 2017 while trying to make up for lost at-bats- he's at his best when he shortens his stroke and uses the entire field. He has the upside of a .260-.270 hitter with 20 homers per season.   A shortstop at Stephen F. Austin State- Dozier moves reasonably well for a 6-foot-4- 220-pounder. A below-average runner with an arm that produced low-90s fastballs as a college reliever- he's an adequate defender at either infield corner.

He ultimately fell to the back end of the first round- where the Blue Jays picked him 29th overall and signed him for $1-944-800. He pitched well in his first full season- finishing in the Class A Advanced Florida State League- but struggled across the board in 2017 with Double-A New Hampshire- posting a 5.41 ERA that ranked second-to-last among qualified Eastern League starting pitchers.    Harris possesses a deep arsenal but lacks an impact pitch. He sits in the low 90s and can reach back for more with his fastball- throwing the pitch with sinking action and late arm-side life- but also catching too much of the plate too often. Harris' power slider plays more like a cutter- thrown in the upper-80s with late slicing action- while both his curveball and changeup are fringe-average offerings. He throws strikes with his entire arsenal and can pitch to both sides of the plate with his heater- although Harris' overall control and command require further refinement.    A tall- athletic right-hander- Harris uses his height to create a favorable plane toward the plate and does a good job of repeating his delivery. He's also very durable- logging a combined 272 2/3 innings in his first two innings.

He was thought to be the best pure prep hitter in that 2015 class and he hit like it during his summer debut in the Gulf Coast League. A shoulder injury interrupted his first full season- though he still showed a solid approach- then he shifted gears and started showing more power in a healthy 2017.    The increased power output was by design- as Randolph changed his hitting philosophy- going from a middle-to-opposite field approach type of hitter to one who learned how to turn on pitches and pull them out of the park. While he still drew walks- his strikeout rate spiked and his average suffered- but learning to drive the ball to the right-center gap and out will serve him well as he tries to reincorporate his natural tendency to use all fields. Randolph is going to have to hit because he is limited to left field only. He won't ever be a Gold Glover- but he's worked to be adequate there.    As a corner outfielder- his ability to hit and hit for power become that much more important. He has the chance to put up some big numbers in Double-A in 2018 and if he can put the two versions of himself together- he still has time to develop into a run-producing threat.,,,,,|,1266,71,205,|,,phi,PHI,,,,,,|,,,,,|,CLE,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,40,55,45,|,,,,,,,,

They never got a chance as a stress fracture in his back kept him off the mound all spring.When healthy- Beck may be the most complete college pitcher on the West Coast in this class. While he has added some good weight since high school- he still is lean and wiry. He has a good feel for three pitches- all of which he can throw for strikes. His fastball sat in the 91-92 mph range. With his frame- there might be room for more velocity- but he's never going to be a power pitcher. Instead- he relies on his excellent fastball command. His best secondary pitch is an outstanding changeup- and he'll throw a solid breaking ball- though sometimes he hangs them up in the zone.The scenario this year is reminiscent of scouts waiting for Cal Quantrill to come back from Tommy John surgery last year as a Stanford junior. Quantrill didn't throw a competitive pitch- but went No. 8 overall to the Padres.

The Royals gave up Scott Alexander and Joakim Soria to acquire Oaks and infielder Erick Mejia in a three-team- six-player trade in January.  Oaks relies heavily on his heavy sinker- which produced a 2.2 groundout/airout ratio though his first four pro seasons. His two-seam fastball sat around 90 mph in college but now operates at 92-96 mph and he can spot it on either side of the plate. The rest of his repertoire grades as fringy to average- with his changeup more reliable than his cutter or short slider.  Though he can't overpower hitters- Oaks goes right after them and refuses to give in. He has walked just 59 batters in 66 pro starts entering 2018 and works deep into games because he keeps his pitch counts low.

He's continued to impress with his pure stuff in the professional ranks- though the results have been uneven. After a rocky 2016 season at the Class A Advanced level that saw him miss time with back and groin injuries as well as the flu- Medeiros returned there in 2017 and showed bat-missing ability more on par with his stuff.   Getting away from his low-three quarters arm slot in '16 cost Medeiros both velocity and life on his fastball. Bigger and stronger in '17- he looked more like his old self in the Carolina League- operating at 92-95 mph with a heavy fastball.   His slider remains a plus pitch- one capable of inducing whiffs on both sides of the plate with its significant lateral break- and he'll also flash above average with his changeup- which has good sink and fade. Medeiros' control continues to be below average- but he was markedly better in that regard in '17- issuing a career-best 3.7 walks-per-nine- down from 6.7 the previous year.  The jury is still out on whether Medeiros- with his unique arm slot and underwhelming control profile- can remain a starter long term. The Brewers think he can- believing that the Hawaiian southpaw will eventually learn how to harness his dynamic three-pitch mix.

The 2016-17 Gatorade Player of the Year for New York- he signed for $988-970 and made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League- where he showed impressive tools- but was largely overmatched in all facets of the game- especially at the plate.   Holmes is a true top-of-the-scale runner- possessing elite- 80-grade speed. He had few opportunities to showcase those wheels during his pro debut- however- as Holmes struggled mightily at the plate to the tune of a .182/.220/.289 slash line and 36.1 strikeout rate. When he's right- Holmes will show bat speed- feel for the barrel and even some raw power to his pull side. Scouts believe he will impact the baseball more consistently once he's added strength to his lean frame.  Holmes' speed makes him a basestealing threat and gives him range for days in center field- where he could develop into a plus defender. Whether Holmes reaches his lofty ceiling will depend on the development of his hit tool in the coming years. If it comes along enough- he could be the kind of dynamic leadoff hitter teams covet- but rarely find.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/uMA6Z9tYqqI?autoplay=1,,|,2041,75,175,|,CLE,,CLE,,,2nd rd 2016,McClancy HS (NY),,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,45,70,40,40,40,40,50,70,55,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,40,80,45,55,|,,,,,,,,

A strong pro debut in the Gulf Coast League pushed him to the Appalachian League that summer- but he's struggled to find his offensive footing since.    The Braves sent Cruz to full-season Rome to start 2017- and it was a mistake. The teenage switch-hitter was in over his head in the South Atlantic League and got sent back down to the Appy League to try to hit the reset button. He still has solid tools and excellent athleticism- with his plus speed his true carrying tool. At his best- he's shown the ability to make consistent contact and spray line drives all over the field- more consistently from the right side than the left. While he was a shortstop initially- he moved over to second when he went back down to Danville a year ago and that's now his likely full-time home- where he should be a capable defender without his fringy arm causing issues.    It's hard to put pressure on a 19-year-old by saying that it's a big year for him- but the 2018 season could be a huge one for Cruz. He has plenty of time to develop into a speedy everyday second baseman- but he needs to start showing what he can do.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/XrcKSetbgCE?autoplay=1,,|,1093,73,180,|,ATL,,ATL,,,J2 2015,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2015 - ATL,|,,,,,|,OAK,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,40,70,45,50,45,40,45,70,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,30,70,45,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA 2018.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 75 | Slider: 65 | Curveball: 60 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Maples landed a $2.5 million deal as a 14th-rounder in 2011 -- still a Draft record for below the third round -- a product of his top-two-rounds talent and his complicated signability because he wanted to play two sports as a pitcher/kicker at North Carolina. He delivered discouraging returns on that investment in his first five pro seasons as he battled injuries and the strike zone. Then he suddenly reversed course in 2017- shooting from high Class A to Chicago while striking out 111 in 68 2/3 innings.  Maples can choose from three overpowering pitches in his fastball- curveball and slider. His heater ranges from 94-100 mph with run and sink. He lost some feel for his curve while focusing on fastball command in his days as a starter- but it's back to the low 80s with downer break- and he has come up with a high-80s slider that's even more of a wipeout pitch.   More than half the batters Maples faced last year failed to put the ball play- either striking out (37 percent) or reaching via a walk or hit batsman (16 percent). While he's athletic- he never has had a smooth delivery or has provided consistent strikes. If he could develop just average control- he could serve as a big league closer- though that may be too much to expect.,,,,,|,2006,74,225,|,CHC,chc,CHC,,,14th rd 2011,Pinecrest HS (NC),,|,,,,,|,NYM,1.800,V,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,70,,,60,,,,30,70,,,60,,,,30,|,,,,,,|,75,,60,65,,,,40

The hulking first baseman subsequently emerged as one of the organization's better pure hitters- delivering a career-high 23 home runs and finishing second and third in the Eastern League in on-base percentage (.387) and slugging (.530)- respectively in 2016. Though he was unable to build on that success in his first Triple-A campaign- Tellez also spent the entire season as a 22-year-old at the Minors' highest level.   A physically strong left-handed hitter- Tellez possesses the requisite bat speed to turn on premium velocity as well as the barrel control to drive the ball out of the park the other way. He became trapped between the two approaches often in 2017- and the result was less impactful contact as well a drop-off in his power- as Tellez's six home runs marked his lowest output at any full-season level. Said approach continued to net him a healthy number of walks- though- and Tellez's manageable strikeout rate suggests he'll resume hitting for both average and power. He'll need to show more utility against same-sided pitching (.148/.235/.213 in '17) to be a regular.  Though a fringy defender at first base- Tellez has worked hard to upgrade his defense to where it should at least be serviceable. Meanwhile- Blue Jays officials rave about Tellez's work ethic and makeup- citing his determination to improve his body and defense as examples. The first-base-only profile is a notoriously difficult one to achieve- but Tellez has the hitting ability and power to make it happen.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/jEnF7574CyA?autoplay=1,,|,366,76,220,|,TOR,tor,TOR,,,30th rd 2013,Elk Grove HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,40,50,60,40,40,30,50,55,60,30,45,30,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,20,45,45,|,,,,,,,,

Overshadowed in the Sale trade package by Yoan Moncada and Michael Kopech- Basabe has considerable upside of his own as a switch-hitting center fielder with five-tool potential. An injury to his left knee hampered him in his first season with his new organization and led to surgery to repair a torn meniscus.  Basabe is still very much a work in progress offensively because his stroke gets long and he's still learning to recognize pitches and control the strike zone. He has impressive bat speed and strength in his hands and wrists- and Chicago hopes to unlock his raw power by getting him to take a more direct path to the ball. With his plus speed and basestealing acumen- he could be a 20-20 player if he improves as a hitter.  Basabe has the tools to play anywhere in the outfield. Andrew Benintendi briefly pushed him to right field when they were teammates at short-season Lowell in Boston's system- but he otherwise has been a center fielder.

To add some value to his package- the Rangers began experimenting with him at catcher during instructional league in 2015 and 2016 and had him play 36 games behind the plate last season. They were encouraged by his initial results- though catching may have taken a toll on his bat as he posted the worst offensive numbers of his career while repeating high Class A.  Morgan employs a simple right-handed swing and approach- showing aptitude for recognizing pitches and controlling the strike zone. His ability to make contact so easily cuts into his walk totals and he never has displayed more than modest power- so he might not contribute much offensively beyond his batting average. He's an average runner but not a basestealing threat.   Catching could be Morgan's ticket to an unusual utility role in the big leagues. He's a steady if unspectacular defender at shortstop- his primary position in 2017- and provides above-average glovework at third base and second base with his soft hands and solid- accurate arm. He still has much to learn behind the plate but has the tools and work ethic to improve enough to serve as a backup there.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/EJkG8sOnJtQ?autoplay=1,,|,850,71,185,|,TEX,,TEX,,,3rd rd 2014,Orange Lutheran HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,45,30,45,40,45,55,55,40,45,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,35,50,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

It looked like they were starting to with a huge 2016 season in Double-A Reading's friendly ballpark- but while he still hit for power in the move to Triple-A in 2017- much of the rest of his offensive game went in the wrong direction.  There are few players- if any- in the Minors with more raw power than the 6-foot-6 Cozens. He could easily miss-hit 20 homers a year at any level- in any ballpark. What got him into trouble in 2017 was that he was trying to hit 20 homers in a month which- in turn- led to a Minors-leading strikeout total. There will always be swing-and-miss to his game- but for him to have a chance- he'll have to get back to focusing on being a more complete hitter.  Cozens runs better than you'd think given his size- has 20 or more steals in three seasons and has worked hard to become a solid corner outfielder.

Gavin has reached the highest level in 2016 and 2017- but whether the 2012 first-round pick is a regular or a utilityman remains to be seen.  Cecchini has above-average bat-to-ball skills- constantly barreling up the baseball and maintaining low strikeout rates throughout his career. While he has added some strength since signing and has more extra-base ability than fellow Mets infield prospect Luis Guillorme- a lack of pop limits his offensive upside. Defensively- Cecchini has been a bit enigmatic. He'll show an above-average to plus arm at times- more than enough to play shortstop- but he's had enough trouble making accurate throws that he is now primarily a second baseman- where he is solid defensively. Growing up around the game- he is a baseball rat who works tirelessly at improving his all-around game.  Cecchini will likely move around and play multiple positions as he tries to establish himself as a big leaguer- but the Mets still think he has enough hit tool- and just enough extra-base ability- to be an everyday second baseman if given the opportunity.,,,,,|,374,74,200,|,NYM,,NYM,,,1st rd 2012,Barbe HS (LA),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.650,2nd,|,55,20,40,40,30,40,60,30,40,40,40,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,35,50,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

But sometimes such adversity can work to a team's advantage. Case in point is Mitchell- who entered his senior year at powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego as one of the best prep bats in the country. When he scuffled for a chunk of the season- his stock fell and the Pirates were thrilled he slipped far enough for them to grab him in the second round with the 50th overall pick in the 2017 Draft.  Mitchell did look more like the hitting prospect people thought he was during his pro debut in the Gulf Coast League. He has an advanced approach at the plate and drew a ton of walks- controlling the strike zone very well for his age- with the chance to be a Major League average- if not better- hitter from the left side of the plate. There is plenty of power to tap into- though trying to muscle up led to him being too pull happy in high school- one of the main reasons for his struggle. The Pirates tend to preach hit over power in the Minors- so that should be a good fit.  The bat will have to play because he's an average defender with a fringy arm who is likely limited to left field as a pro. The good news is it looks like he's rediscovered his swing and should have the profile for an outfield corner spot in the future.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/yal8ZxNmuHI?autoplay=1,,|,2002,72,209,|,PIT,pit,PIT,,,2nd rd 2017,Rancho Bernardo HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,COL,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,50,40,40,40,50,45,55,40,50,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,45,45,50,|,,,,,,,,

He regressed enormously the following year- first in Triple-A and then back in the Southern League following a brief stint in extended spring training. Returning to Double-A in 2017- Lopez was finally moved from the rotation to a bullpen role for which he's much better suited. The role change enabled him to get back on track- and he finished in the big leagues as a September callup.   Lopez pitched with 92-97 mph fastball out of the bullpen for much of the season- albeit with little movement. For that reason- the Brewers had him scrap his four-seamer in favor of a two-seam fastball late in the season- and he continued to make strides in developing the pitching during offseason winter ball.   He pairs his heater with curveball in the high 70s that has good shape and downer action- flashing plus at times but usually playing more above average. His changeup has steadily improved but still lags behind his two main offerings.   Lopez repeated his delivery and release point more consistently in 2017 and had his control improve as a result- all while continuing to miss a healthy number of bats. Encouraged by the right-hander's bounce-back campaign- Brewers club officials expect Lopez to make even greater strides as he becomes more comfortable in his new bullpen role.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/yNFMO_99TMc?autoplay=1,,|,168,75,195,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,2nd rd 2011,Caguas Military HS (PR),,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,50,55,,,,,35,60,50,55,,,,,40,|,,,,,,|,60,50,55,,,,,40

Thought to be a quick-to-the-big leagues college performer- things didn't go quite as planned- though he did lead the Minor Leagues in groundout-to-airout ratio and had the best ground ball ratio of any pitcher in baseball- including the big leagues.  Jones has plenty of fastball- typically in the low-90s- but it plays up move because of his plus plus sink and his ability to get outs early in counts as a result. He does have usable secondary weapons and understands how to pitch soft- but doesn't always use it effectively. His slider is ahead of his curve- and he has good feel for a changeup- but trusting all of it has been an issue. He's smoothed out his delivery somewhat since his college days- but is still working to repeat it consistently. That's led to more control issues than anticipated- with a 3.9 BB/9 rate in his first full season.

Many prospects have stumbled there- with how they learn from that adversity and adjust a key to what kind of player they become. The Reds will be watching to see how Aquino handles all of that after really struggling in the Southern League in 2017.    Aquino still has tremendous raw tools. Despite his struggles- he still hit for power and played a strong right field with very good speed and a plus arm that runners didn't want to test. Facing more advanced pitchers- however- didn't go so well overall. Aquino saw a steady diet of breaking and offspeed pitches and he never adjusted to it. He's always been an aggressive hitter- but his strikeout rate spiked with his inability to recognize softer stuff.    The good news is Aquino's raw tools still give him a chance to succeed. He'll have to show that he can make adjustments- not just from last year's struggles- but from game to game and at-bat to at-bat. How he does that will determine if he can be one of those prospects who can run the Double-A gauntlet and move forward.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/alUGGntk5KI?autoplay=1,,|,1495,76,220,|,CIN,,CIN,,,J2 2010,Dominican Republic,Jan. 18- 2011 - CIN,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,30,40,60,45,45,60,40,55,60,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,55,70,50,|,,,,,,,,

The North Georgia native struggled with the move to full-season ball in 2015- hitting just .231 with a Midwest League-leading 162 strikeouts at Class A Fort Wayne. Gettys fared much better in his return to Fort Wayne in 2016- however- earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Midwest League before advancing to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in late June and finishing in the Arizona Fall League. Returning to the California League in 2017- Gettys continued to show loud tools but regressed overall as he finished as the circuit leader in both strikeouts (191) and strikeout rate (37.2 percent).  Gettys' swing is explosive and produces plus raw power that he can apply in games -- he hit a career-best 17 home runs in 2017 -- despite holes in his bat path and overall approach. He continues to strike out at a disconcerting rate- a product of his subpar pitch recognition and strike-zone management- and thus faces questions about the future utility of his hit tool. Plus speed allows Gettys to impact games on the basepaths as well as in center field- where he's a plus defender- with range for days and a cannon arm.  With raw power- speed- arm strength and defensive ability that all grade as average or better- Gettys has an undeniably impressive ceiling. The jury is still out on whether he can make the necessary swing adjustments to become an everyday player- but his speed- center-field defense and strong track record against left-handed pitching could still make him a valuable fourth outfielder.,,,,,|,819,73,203,|,,sd,SD,,,,,,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,50,60,70,60,|,,,,,,,,

But he slumped as a junior at Arizona and fared better on the mound- leading all Division I pitchers with 41 strikeouts during the NCAA tournament and surrendering just two earned runs in two College World Series starts as the Wildcats finished second. He posted a 1.101 OPS in his pro debut after signing for an above-slot $650-000- then dropped to .772 while battling an old hamate injury in 2017.  Dalbec has the most raw power in the Red Sox system -- even more than Michael Chavis- who ranked fifth in the Minors with 31 homers last year -- thanks to his strength- bat speed- loft in his right-handed stroke and take-no-prisoners approach. He kept his aggressiveness in check during his debut- using the middle of the field and letting pitches travel deep- but tried to do too much while making up for lost time last year and struck out in a whopping 37 percent of his plate appearances. He has holes in his swing and always will rack up a lot of whiffs- but he'll need to be more disciplined to tap into it.  Though Dalbec lacks speed- he has a surprisingly quick first step and has worked to add range at third base. He should be an average defender there once he improves his consistency.

He had 16 walks and nine wild pitches in his pro debut before missing all of 2017 while battling shoulder fatigue. The Rockies decided to shift him from starter to reliever when he returned to the mound this season- and the initial results in low Class A were encouraging.  Tyler could sit in the mid-90s with his fastball while working in the rotation and pitches at 96-99 mph coming out of the bullpen. Besides its overpowering velocity- his heater also features run- sink and downhill plane that make it tough to square up. His second-best pitch is a changeup with sink and fade that's a plus offering at times.  Tyler has struggled to come up with a reliable breaking ball and currently employs a knuckle-curve. Given his inconsistent track record of throwing strikes and staying healthy- he was destined to end up in the bullpen. If he can continue to find the strike zone as easily as he has in the first part of 2018- he could develop into a high-leverage reliever.,,,,,|,342,76,226,|,COL,,COL,,,1st rd 2016,Georgia,,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,60,55,40,,,,,30,60,60,45,,,,,40,|,,,,,,|,75,55,40,,,,,40

Though power is his carrying tool- he didn't homer in his 2015 pro debut before bouncing back with 30 homers in 120 games over the next two seasons. He also struck out in 32 percent of his plate appearances- making him the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the system.  Garcia's outstanding bat speed and strength give him top-of-the-scale raw power- though it remains to be seen how much he'll be able to tap into it against more advanced pitching. He still has trouble with recognizing pitches and handling offspeed offerings- and he has yet to prove he can make consistent contact. He has displayed a willingness to accept walks- though he still chases pitches out of the strike zone with alarming frequency.  Garcia has to deliver on his power potential because almost all of his value comes from his bat. He has plenty of arm strength for third base- but he's a well below-average runner with limited range and a history of errors at the hot corner. He began seeing action at first base in 2017 but may never be more than an adequate defender there.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/d-BKTy1j3vI?autoplay=1,,|,686,75,200,|,NYY,nyy,NYY,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,July 2- 2014 - NYY,|,,,,,|,SD,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,70,40,40,60,40,60,80,30,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,55,30,60,40,|,,,,,,,,

While data in games won't show up until this summer- Garcia did make a strong first impression in the Dominican Republic and at instructs with his feel for the game at such a young age.  One of the bigger things that stood out was Garcia's glove at shortstop. He has plus range- excellent hands and good footwork- with a plus arm that really stands out. Given that he's just 17 for all of the 2018 season- there are obvious strength gains that will need to occur- but there's confidence that will come as he starts to mature. There are some ingredients at the plate the Phillies already like- including a solid approach at the plate that doesn't feature too much free or wild swinging. He exhibits some balance from both sides of the plate with barrel control.  This isn't the kind of investment that brings a quick return. The Phillies knew they were in it for the long game when they signed Garcia.

High- Rizzo proved a divisive 2016 Draft prospect due to his lack of size as well as concerns surrounding his future position. The Mariners- however- were thrilled to find him still on the board in the second round- as they selected Rizzo with the No. 50 overall pick and then signed him for more than slot value at $1-750-000. Assigned to Class A Clinton for his first full season- Rizzo held his own in the Midwest League at age 19 before advancing to Class A Advanced Modesto late in the season. His bat came alive at the more advanced level- as Rizzo erupted to hit .421 in the postseason to garner honors as the California League Championship Series MVP.  Rizzo shows feel to hit from the left side- with good bat speed and hand-eye coordination as well as a discernable eye. Club officials believe he'll develop into an above-average hitter with at least average power- though a penchant for swinging and missing has resulted in little pop early in his career. Whereas some scouts believe Rizzo can become an adequate third baseman- others feel he's destined for first base or left field- where his below-average speed and average arm strength would be less of an issue. Rizzo is thickly built and doesn't require much physical projection- so he will need to focus on conditioning and adding good strength to his 5-foot-9 frame in future seasons.   Beyond Rizzo's physical tools- the Mariners rave about the makeup and baseball IQ- noting that it has already helped him to overcome adversity as a professional. He has many gains to make on both sides of the ball and is likely to move down the defensive spectrum- but the potential is there for him to develop into an everyday player.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/VU5-CG99f8E?autoplay=1,,|,1603,69,194,|,SEA,sea,SEA,,,2nd rd 2016,Oakton HS (VA),,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,35,20,45,30,30,50,60,40,45,30,40,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,40,50,45,|,,,,,,,,

He has done exactly that since signed him as an eighth-rounder in 2014- leading the Rookie-level Pioneer League in slugging (.590) in his debut and slamming 84 homers in his first four seasons. Though Kansas City gambled by not protecting him on its 40-man roster this offseason- he could emerge as the departed Eric Hosmer's successor at first base.  After being asked to serve pitches to the opposite field by his college coaches- O'Hearn now just worries about hammering the ball. His strength and leverage create above-average raw power and allow him to drive pitches out of the park to all fields. Strikeouts are part of the package because he has a long left-handed swing and an aggressive approach- though he will take walks when opponents try to pitch around him.  A well below-average runner with limited range at first base- O'Hearn has worked to make himself an acceptable defender and does have soft hands.

He's had to prove himself at each level- but is coming off of back-to-back years of finishing in the top two in ERA and strikeouts in the organization- all while reaching Double-A in 2017.  Hall's fastball is fringy- at best- barely scraping 90 mph- not a pitch to strike fear in the hearts of opposing hitters. What he does have is possibly the best curveball in the system. He has a plus plus feel to spin it and will throw it at any point in the count- which- in turn- allows his fastball to play up a bit. He can also mix in an effective changeup at times. His ability to pitch off his curve has enabled him to continue missing bats and he does a nice job of getting weak contact on the ground.

He made his organizational debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2015 and earned All-Star honors there the following year before opening the '17 season in the Class A Short Season Northwest League. It was there where Hernandez was stationed when the Marlins acquired him and right-handers Brandon Miller- Pablo Lopez and Lukas Schiraldi from Seattle in July in exchange for David Phelps.  Hernandez has promising tools that he's still learning to apply. He tried switch-hitting during his pro debut before scrapping it at the request of the Mariners and hitting exclusively from his natural side in 2016. A line-drive hitter with good bat speed- he makes consistent contact to all fields- though the quality of said contact is underwhelming. He's shown little in the way of power to begin his career- though scouts do believe he'll start to clear more fences as he grows into his projectable frame. Hernandez's speed translates well in center field- where he profiles as a future plus defender with plenty of range and a plus arm.  Though Hernandez likely will need time to refine his all-around game and come into his own as a player- he has the raw tools needed to develop into a Major Leaguer. Hernandez's development at the plate in the coming years should help to bring his ultimate ceiling into focus- but it goes without saying that the Marlins- much like Seattle- believe it could be considerable.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/ndl-wG3DJac?autoplay=1,,|,693,74,175,|,MIA,mia,MIA,,,J2 2014,Dominican Republic,July 27- 2014 - SEA,|,,,,,|,PHI,0.500,XXX,|,25,20,35,50,40,60,50,30,40,50,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,35,60,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

After leading the NWL in hitting (.358) and on-base percentage (.432)- he hasn't come close to matching those numbers in his first two full seasons. Traded by the Mariners with right-hander Aneurys Zabala to the Dodgers for Chase De Jong in March 2017- he reached Double-A in August but batted just .234/.346/.324 there.  Jackson is one of the best athletes in the system. Both his cannon arm and his speed grade well above average and give him the ability to play all over the diamond. He's a quality defender at second base and capable at shortstop- his two main positions- and also appeared briefly at third base and center field last year.   A lack of feel for hitting hurt Brett Jackson and the same fate may befall Drew- who has been exposed earlier in his pro career. He's most effective when he shortens his right-handed swing- forgets about power and uses the whole field- but he has difficulty maintaining that approach. If he could get on base consistently- he could wreak havoc with his speed.,,,,,|,1121,74,200,|,LAD,lad,LAD,,,5th rd 2015,Stanford,,|,,,,,|,BOS,0.500,XXX,|,35,30,50,60,45,70,40,40,50,60,50,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,35,65,70,55,|,,,,,,,,

He made steady progress in subsequent years before finally breaking out at the plate in 2016 with Triple-A Iowa- where he was stationed when the Cubs dealt him to Seattle for Mike Montgomery and Jordan Pries in July. He earned his first big league promotion that year as a September callup. He was back in the Majors with the Mariners on three separate occasions in 2017- but otherwise spent much of the season in Triple-A.   Vogelbach has long been the epitome of a bat-only prospect- showing impressive natural hitting ability- a strong approach and- of course- his trademark raw power. But despite having hit for both average and power at every stage of his career- Vogelbach has struggled in his limited big league opportunities to the tune of a .175 average with one extra-base hit (a double) in 40 at-bats spanning parts of 24 games. Further complicating Vogelbach's profile is his inability to hit same-sided pitching- something he did at a .234/.290/.328 clip over 138 plate appearances in 2017.   As a bottom-of-the-scale runner and a well-below-average defender at first base- Vogelbach's value is tied to his offensive output. There's still reason to believe that the big left-handed hitter- given his Minor League track record- will eventually figure things out offensively. However- with the Mariners already exploring other options at first base- including Rule 5 pick Mike Ford and offseason acquisition Ryon Healy- Vogelbach's window to carve out a big league role is fading.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/WVUvxa6mRUs?autoplay=1,,|,140,72,250,|,SEA,sea,SEA,,,2nd rd 2011,Bishop Verot HS (FL),,|,,,,,|,STL,0.750,2nd,|,50,45,60,20,30,40,55,50,60,20,30,40,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,20,40,30,|,,,,,,,,

He cost just $50-000 coming out of Venezuela but has developed into one of the better hitters in the system. He was thriving in his first taste of full-season ball in 2017 until he broke his leg in mid-June.    Galindo has the potential to hit for both power and average. A right-handed hitter- he did a better job of making consistent contact last year. He has impressive strength and raw power- though he needs to curb his tendency to hit ground balls to realize his 20-homer potential.    Despite his below-average speed- Galindo moves OK at third base and has the requisite strong arm for the position. Footwork issues and throwing inaccuracies led to 59 errors in his first 146 pro games at the hot corner- however.

He's hit a bunch of home runs- he's struck out a lot- he's served an 80-game suspension and he's been traded (from the Rangers to the Braves late in 2016). His first full season with Atlanta was also his first in Double-A- and it didn't go so well. The Braves didn't add him to the 40-man roster- but he was not selected in last December's Rule 5 Draft.    While his 2017 season was a disappointment- there were some positive signs- including a reduced strikeout rate and a strong August that saw him hit .316/.393/.481- numbers that perhaps can be used as a springboard. He was adjusting to the Braves' approach to hitting- and the organization thinks there's more pure hit tool than he's shown. The raw power is legit- and if he can make more consistent contact- it will show up in games more often.    Demerirtte has already shown he can be an excellent defender at second and has more than enough arm for third. He's athletic enough to play the outfield- so the Braves might expose him to that in 2018 to help maximize his versatility and value as a power-hitting utility type.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/YQjbmtOH1mU?autoplay=1,,|,66,72,180,|,ATL,,ATL,,,1st rd 2013,Winder Barrow HS (GA),,|,,,,,|,CHA,0.500,XXX,|,20,45,60,45,50,50,30,55,60,45,55,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,50,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

Martinez last July. Jose King is just starting out his pro career- while Dawel Lugo's bat is more intriguing than his glove- which will likely be at second. Of the trio- it is Alcantara who is a sure-fire shortstop- though it's unclear if he'll hit enough to be an everyday one at the big league level.  There are no questions about Alcantara's ability to defend- however. He can flat out play the premium position with an easily plus arm and excellent hands. While he's an average runner at best- he has enough range thanks to his instincts and a terrific first step. His defense is so highly regarded- he was the regular shortstop for Licey in the Domincan Winter League this offseason. At the plate- Alcantara does put the ball in play- keeping his strikeouts down- and will even draw some walks. But he has no power at all and the first thing anyone says about him offensively is that he needs to add strength.  Alcantara doesn't have to start putting balls over fences at the plate to be a big leaguer. He just needs to show he can impact the baseball enough to keep defenders honest- especially as he approaches the upper levels. At worst- he's a defensive-minded utilityman who helps wins games with his glove.,,,,,|,730,69,168,|,DET,det,DET,,,J2 2012,Dominican Republic,July 10- 2012 - ARI,|,,,,,|,NYM,0.500,XXX,|,35,20,30,50,50,70,55,30,30,50,60,70,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,20,50,70,60,|,,,,,,,,

He stood out most for his offensive potential as an amateur- but as is the case with so many prep catchers- his bat has lagged behind his defense in the professional ranks. A hand injury sustained in June 2016 affected Ciuffo's development on both sides of the ball- but he returned fully healthy in '17 to enjoy his best all-around season- all of which he spent in Double-A. Left off the Rays' 40-man roster after the season- Ciuffo received a 50-game suspension in February after his second positive test for a drug of abuse.  The Rays' defensive player of the year in back-to-back years- Ciuffo has made considerable strides in improving his blocking and receiving since signing. His plus arm strength and advanced catch-and-throw skills help him control the running game- a notion supported by his career caught-stealing rate of 46 percent in 263 games behind the plate. Meanwhile- club officials are quick to praise Ciuffo's leadership qualities and feel for handling a staff- even in the wake of his suspension.   Ciuffo is less advanced from the left side of the plate- where he employs an up-the-middle approach and produces good bat speed. He did a better job controlling the strike zone in 2017 and had his walk rate jump to a full-season best 10.1 percent as a result. Ciuffo also began to tap into some of his raw power- as his seven home runs surpassed his career total (five) from his previous 253 games spanning four seasons. Even if Ciuffo's bat is merely average- he still stands to carve out a role as at least a big league backup based on his defensive merits.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/-KELTvpMYp4?autoplay=1,,|,304,73,205,|,TBR,,TB,,,1st rd 2013,Lexington HS (SC),,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,45,40,55,20,50,55,50,45,55,20,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,40,30,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

Called on to make a spot start- the left-hander tossed 4 1/3 scoreless innings- allowing just two hits and retiring 12 of the 14 hitters he faced- to propel the Tribe to a 3-0 victory and its sixth American League pennant. Merritt continued to pitch well as a big leaguer spot starter in 2017- though a loaded Indians rotation kept him buried for much of the year in Triple-A- where he turned in yet another solid campaign. The southpaw opened the season on the 10-day disabled list with a left knee sprain.  What Merritt lacks in stuff he makes up for with pitchability and excellent command. The left-hander adds and subtracts from his upper-80s fastball and complements it with an above-average changeup. He knows how to use his curveball effectively while also mixing in a below-average slider simply to keep hitters guessing and off balance. Everything he throws plays up thanks to plus control and command that has helped him produce just 1.5 walks-per-nine nine innings in over 800 career frames in the Minors.  Merritt's lack of premium stuff and perennially low strikeout rates limit his upside- but he's more than qualified to serve as a fifth starter or swingman in the big leagues- a role he's likely to keep filling for the Indians going forward.,,,,,|,1678,72,180,|,,cle,CLE,,,,,,|,,,,,|,PHI,1.500,V,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,45,55,50,40,,,,60

He impressed with his hitting ability and power potential two years later during his U.S. debut- only to have much of his 2016 campaign wiped out due to a back injury. After a grueling rehab process- a healthy Franco made his long-awaited full-season debut with Class A Hagerstown and began to make up for lost time by playing a career-high 120 games.   A physically strong right-handed hitter with projection remaining- Franco has a quick bat and generates good power to his pull side- leading club officials to peg him for at least average in-game power once fully developed. He has trouble recognizing spin and making consistent contact- though both should improve as he gains much needed experience. Overall- Franco's approach is advanced for his age- providing him with a solid foundation for offensive growth.  After playing third base exclusively during the 2015-16 seasons- Franco saw increased time at first base in '17- in part to ensure that he stayed healthy and on the field.

The Blue Jays preferred Danner in the latter role- drafting him in the second round and then signing him for close to $500-000 above slot value. But after a pro debut that saw him hit just .160 with a 26.5 percent strikeout rate over 34 games in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League- the jury is still out regarding Danner's positional future.   Danner is raw behind the plate but has the chance to be a special catcher. He has good hands and a plus arm defensively -- he was up to 94-95 mph on the mound as a prep -- and while he's a below-average runner- his athleticism helps him move well behind the dish. He swings the bat well from a crouch set up- with quiet pop that could end up being average power in the future- but he'll need to distance himself from his current pull-heavy approach to be successful against pro arms.   The one thing scouts agree on is that Danner's grades will improve now that he's focused solely on catching and hitting. At the same time- Danner's pro debut indicated that he would need considerable time to refine his game on both sides of the ball. At the worst- Danner's power arm represents an interesting fallback option should he have trouble sticking as a catcher.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/zOSvxofwJBY?autoplay=1,,|,2034,74,185,|,TOR,,TOR,,,2nd rd 2017,Huntington Beach HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,MIL,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,55,50,40,60,40,50,60,40,50,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,30,60,50,|,,,,,,,,

ETA ??,Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 45 | Changeup: 45 | Control: 40 | Overall: 45  Kolek's big- physical frame and triple-digit fastball made him a legitimate candidate to be the first overall pick in the 2014 Draft. He ended up going second overall to the Marlins and signed for a franchise-record $6 million. He had an inconsistent but promising first full season in the Class A South Atlantic League and showed up to Spring Training in 2016 in better shape- only to suffer an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in early April. After a 15-month absence- the big right-hander finally returned to the mound in July 2017 in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League- where he issued 14 walks in just 3 2/3 innings.  After showcasing elite velocity as an amateur- Kolek worked more in the low- to mid-90s during his full-season debut. He throws his heater with heavy sinking action that leads to many groundouts and few home runs. Both Kolek's slider and changeup are below average- and that lack of an out pitch limits his bat-missing ability. He did make some strides with the former before getting hurt- throwing it with improved depth and power.  The Marlins worked with Kolek to refine his delivery during his rehab process with the hope that it would help him regain some velocity- as well as better command.

He pitched well in the lower levels of Washington's system- earning All-Star honors in the New York-Penn League in 2016 and again in the South Atlantic League a year later. Clearly- the Twins noticed and received the tall lefty in return for Brandon Kintzler at the 2017 Trade Deadline.  While Watson's pure stuff doesn't jump off the page- what he does with it makes it all play up. His fastball tops out at around 90-91 mph in most starts- but he commands it well and uses his 6-foot-5 frame to throw downhill. Right now- his curve is his best secondary option- a breaking ball with tight spin and good downer action- but his changeup has improved markedly since entering the pro game. He adds to and subtracts from it and it has the chance to be above-average or even plus in the future.  Watson's ability to throw strikes and mix pitches gave him the chance to be a big league starter. The improvement of that third pitch raises his ceiling a bit more- with the upside of a No. 3 type starter.,,,,,|,1845,77,200,|,,,MIN,,,,,,|,,,,,|,SF,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,50,55,,,,,50

He improved in each of his three seasons with the Fighting Irish- ultimately earning a $300-000 signing bonus as the Blue Jays' fifth-round pick in 2016. After an up-and-down first full season in the Class A Advanced Florida State League- Biggio emerged as a rising prospect in Toronto's system in 2018 behind a torrid start to his first Double-A campaign.   Biggio's offensive game is built around his plus plate discipline and approach- as he's long showed a knack for drawing walks and getting on base at a high clip. He has natural hitting ability from the left side of the plate- with feel for the barrel that encourages his use of the entire field- albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. An adjustment to Biggio's hands in his stance has enabled him to hit the ball in the air more consistently and tap into his raw power- and it took him just 33 Double-A games in 2018 to surpass his career-high home run total from the previous year.  That Biggio's primary position is second base adds even more value to his offensive profile. He's a solid if unspectacular defender there- making up for modest range with sure-handedness- sound footwork and good instincts. The Blue Jays have steadily increased Biggio's versatility in full-season ball- offering him reps at both infield and outfield corners to go along with his usual work at the keystone.,,,,,|,327,73,203,|,,,TOR,,,,,,|,,,,,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,50,45,50,50,|,,,,,,,,

He missed nearly six weeks with a right thumb injury during his full-season debut and underwent surgery to repair a broken hamate bone in his left hand that fall. Though healthy for all of 2016- Reyes was overmatched as the youngest everyday player in the Class A Advanced Carolina League. His strong start in '17- meanwhile- was derailed by a three-month absence for a broken finger he suffered while punching a wall. Reyes did return to finish his season on a high note- ultimately hitting .302/.333/.434 over 50 Carolina League contests.   Reyes generates plus raw power from the right side of the plate with his above-average bat speed and natural feel for driving the ball to all fields. He's shown flashes of applying that power during games- and it doesn't take much to envision Reyes clearing even more fences as he matures. There are questions about his ability to hit for average- though Orioles club officials were pleased with the mechanical adjustments he made late in the season and then during fall instructional league.   Reyes has improved his glove work and has the plus arm strength needed for third base- but as a well-below-average runner who will only get bigger- it might be a challenge for him to remain at the position.

The Blue Jays selected him with the No. 11 overall pick that June- making Pentecost the highest-drafted player in program history- and he signed for $2-888-300. His pro career has been derailed by injuries- however- as a trio of shoulder surgeries (two on his right) and other nagging injuries have limited Pentecost to just 171 games across four seasons.    Pentecost still possesses the same combination of hitting ability and power that made him a first-rounder in 2014. The right-handed hitter utilizes a short- compact swing and makes hard contact from line to line- with the ability to get to his power in games when healthy. He can be overly aggressive at times in the box- but overall he has a good approach and controls the strike zone well.    Pentecost's blend of athleticism and tools still gives him upside as a catcher- and he's looked fine back there in limited action since returning the field. However- he has yet to appear in back-to-back games at the position- a challenge he'll obviously need to overcome soon. Should Pentecost not stick behind the plate- his bat could also make him a fit in left field or at first base.,,,,,|,763,74,191,|,,tor,TOR,,,,,,|,,,,,|,TAM,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,45,45,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

It looked like a potential coup when Colorado landed him with the 23rd overall pick and a $2.3 million bonus- but he recorded a 6.70 ERA with 51 walks in 47 innings in two seasons of Rookie ball. The Rockies were encouraged by the progress he was making in Spring Training last year until he injured his elbow and required Tommy John surgery that cost him the entire 2017 season.    Before he got hurt- Nikorak was throwing in the mid-90s with a simplified delivery. When he's at his best- he can throw two-seam fastballs in the low 90s with sink- four-seamers that reach 98 mph- spin a hammer curveball and even flash a plus changeup. During his first two pro seasons- however- he often worked with a fastball sitting around 90 mph and diminished secondary pitches.    Nikorak has trouble keeping his delivery in sync and maintaining a consistent arm slot- leading him to pitch tentatively and lose the strike zone. He did make some improvements in 2016 and more last spring- and the Rockies thought he was on the verge of a breakthrough before his elbow gave out. Youth and the athleticism that made him an all-conference quarterback in high school are still on his side.,,,,,|,1262,77,205,|,,,COL,,,,,,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,50,55,,,,,45

ETA 2020.,Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Curveball: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 45  Thompson's lengthy track record of success- which dates back to winning multiple gold medals with U.S. national teams while in high school- played a role in Chicago taking him in the third round of the 2017 Draft. He served as a two-way player as an Auburn freshman in 2014 before blowing out his elbow the next year and missing all of 2016 while recovering from Tommy John surgery. He returned last year and showed he had regained his stuff and command by opening his redshirt junior season with a school-record 22 2/3-innings scoreless streak.  As is the case with Cubs 2017 first-rounders Brendon Little and Alex Lange- Thompson's best pitch is a curveball with true downer action that elicits well-above-average grades at times. While he won't dazzle radar guns with his velocity- his two-seam fastball in the low 80s is effective because of its sink and his four-seamer that can reach 95 works because of its high spin rate. He also has good feel for his changeup- a plus pitch at its best.  Thompson has become a more mature pitcher since his elbow reconstruction- focusing on getting out and no longer worrying about velocity. He fills the strike zone with all four of his offerings and understands pitch sequencing. He has a high floor- looking like a safe bet to reach the big leagues as either a workhorse No. 4 starter or a reliever who relies on his curve.,,,,,|,2009,72,193,|,,chc,CHC,,,,,,|,,,,,|,BAL,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,50,55,60,,,,,55

He got back on the mound in 2012 and didn't do much to distinguish himself until a strong winter in the Mexican Pacific League in 2014. He has progressed rapidly since and made his big league debut last year- when he served four different stints in New York.  Gallegos has a quick arm- and his fastball has risen from 90-93 mph when he was a starter to 93-96 mph now that he's a reliever. His heater can get flat at the higher end of his velocity range- so he needs to be careful to keep it down in the zone. He has a second plus pitch in a low-80s curveball and does a nice job of manipulating its spin and shape.  Gallegos also has a fringy changeup from his days in the rotation and occasionally will use it against left-handers. He has pounded the strike zone throughout his career and wasn't afraid to challenge big leaguers after joining the Yankees.

He reached Double-A at age 21 last August and handled himself well in the final month. Ockimey's 2018 debut was delayed by a hamstring injury.  With bat speed- strength and loft in his swing- Ockimey has the best raw power of any left-handed hitter in Boston's system. The question is whether he'll make enough contact to get the most out of it because he gets aggressive and lengthens his swing- resulting in a 28 percent strikeout rate though his first four seasons. He does manage deep counts and take walks- but more advanced pitchers aren't going to work around him as often if they can get him to chase.  Ockimey has to hit because he's limited athletically. He has worked hard on his conditioning and defense- but he still has well below-average speed and will be adequate at best at first base.

Murphy put himself in position to take over as Colorado's regular catcher when he hit five homers during a September 2016 callup- but he fractured his forearm in Spring Training last year and missed more than two months.  With his strength- bat speed and the loft in his right-handed swing- Murphy is built to hit 20 or more homers per year at Coors Field.

The Cubs paid him a well above-slot $1.7 million in the second round in June 2015- then traded him to the Royals for Alec Mills in Februrary 2017. He spent his first season in his new organization in Double-A- establishing himself as one of the better hitters and defenders in Kansas City's system while also standing out with his passion.  Thanks to his hand-eye coordination and bat speed- Dewees consistently produces line drives from the left side of the plate.

Quinn struck out in 34 percent of his plate appearances in the final two months- but he's better than that. He doesn't have the smoothest right-handed swing but usually makes consistent hard contact to all fields. The strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3- 225-pound frame gives him power to all fields- and he's at his best when he doesn't worry about home runs.

With soft hands and more quickness than most catchers- Nunez has steadily improved into a solid receiver. He has arm strength to match and has gotten better with his transfer and accuracy. He impresses with his leadership skills as well- and there's no doubt that he'll be able to catch at the big league level.   Whether he'll be able to hit is another question after he slid to .202/.335/.354 in Double-A last year- then went 4-for-44 in the Arizona Fall League.

He further raised his profile with a tremendous transition to full-season ball and earned a promotion up to the Florida State League. That lasted just two starts- however- as he was shut down in late June with an elbow injury that resulted in Tommy John surgery in August- which will knock him out for all of 2018.  Humphreys is a strong and physical right-hander with solid present stuff and the chance to gain as he matures once he's healthy. His fastball will sit in the 90-94 mph range with good movement to it- and there could be more in the tank. He can spin a breaking ball- with a curve that is above-average at times and a slider he'll mix in occasionally. His changeup gives him an effective weapon against lefties. He's missed plenty of bats and is an extreme strike-thrower- with a career 1.6 walks per nine innings rate.  When Humphreys returns- presumably to start the 2019 season- he will still be just 22 years old. There's plenty of time to get back on track and reach his ceiling as a No. 4 type starter.,,,,,|,2208,74,223,|,,nym,NYM,,,,,,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,50,50,45,,,,60

He honored his commitment to Nebraska and turned in three strong seasons for the Huskers before the Rays made him the highest-drafted position player to come out of the program since Alex Gordon in 2005 by selecting him in the second round of the 2016 Draft.  After making his pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League- Boldt made the jump straight to Class A Advanced Charlotte in 2017 and impressed over a full season in the Florida State League- where he ranked among the circuit leaders with a .295 average (third)- 130 hits (third) and 23 steals (eighth). His left-handed swing has a level plane that helps him use the entire field and deliver power to the gaps- and club officials believe he'll eventually develop some over-the-fence power as he gains experience and adds more strength to his projectable frame. Boldt has good speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school- though he did make noticeable gains with his basestealing technique and reading pitchers in '17.   Boldt can hold his own in center field- where he gets good jumps and takes efficient routes on fly balls- but he likely profiles better at an outfield corner long-term. He's seen time at all three spots early in his career- portending a potential career as a fourth or fifth outfielder in the big leagues.,,,,,|,313,74,210,|,,,TB,,,,,,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,50,40,55,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

The Clemson product went in the second round as a result- then saw his prospect stock plummet with a dreadful first full season in 2017.    A natural leader who prides himself on being tough behind the plate- it turned out Okey had hid a right hand and wrist injury from the organization- self-treating it at night and playing through it. It clearly impacted his hitting as he batted only .185 and slugged .265. The Reds are hoping he can get back to the average hitter that he was pre-injury- one with some power to tap into. While he couldn't handle the bat- Okey did impress the organization with his defensive play. He's great working with pitchers- calling a good game to go along with solid blocking and receiving skills. His throwing has improved- and he's thrown out just over 33 percent of potential base stealers in his career heading into 2018.    Because of the injury- Okey perhaps deserves a mulligan for his lost offensive first full year- but an injury to the other wrist delayed the start of his 2018 season. If he can stay healthy- he might be a prospect who shoots up this list and reclaims his mantel as the best overall catching prospect from his Draft class.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/0OchJQB5jr4?autoplay=1,,|,322,71,195,|,CIN,,CIN,,,2nd rd 2016,Clemson,,|,,,,,|,KC,0.500,XXX,|,30,30,50,40,45,50,40,45,50,40,50,50,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,45,40,50,55,|,,,,,,,,

He reached Double-A at age 20 at the end of 2016 but didn't look the same there last year when his stuff regressed. The Texas League batted .302/.350/.450 against him- with left-handers pounding him for a .906 OPS.  Jurado previously had displayed one of the most effective sinkers in the Minors- placing 15th in groundout/airout ratio (2.0) in 2016 with a higher strikeout rate (7.8 per nine innings) than any of the pitchers who ranked ahead of him. His 88-94 mph two-seam fastball wasn't as heavy in 2017 and got crushed as he repeatedly left it over the plate. His changeup had shown some signs of becoming a plus pitch in the past but was much more average.        Jurado's slider remains a slurvy third option- so he lacked any avenue to missing bats. He did maintain his ability to pound the strike zone- though that was just a recipe for hard-hit contact and he gave up more homers (16) than he surrendered in his first four seasons combined (14).

Their first selection came in the Competitive Balance Round A and they used the No. 39 overall pick to take Grier out of Auburn. Shoulder soreness kept him from showing what he could do until his first full season and he had a solid performance in the Midwest League- though he faded a bit down the stretch.    Grier's carrying tool is his speed. It allowed him to finish second in the organization with 30 steals a year ago and also helps him cover a lot of ground in center field- where he should be able to stay defensively long-term- and where his fringy arm will be fine. He's starting to learn that his profile will likely be at- or close to- the top of a lineup- and with that- on-base skills will be needed. There is swing and miss to his game- but his approach is improving and the D-backs believe he will increase his walk rate and decrease hit strikeout rate as he matures. Better counts will let him tap into some power that's there and allow him to barrel the ball up well even more consistently.    Grier's first full season built a good foundation- with strides taken and things still to work on.

Expected to be one of the first players from the 2016 Draft to reach the big leagues- he went straight to low Class A after signing for an above-slot $1.6 million in the second round and led the South Atlantic League with 11 holds in 26 appearances. Then he missed all of 2017 with a bulging disc in his back that didn't require surgery.  Bowden operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that peaks at 97 and features late life and steep downhill plane. He has full trust in his changeup- which tumbles and shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. His breaking ball is a slurvy hybrid but does have some power and could become a solid slider.  With three pitches- control and a durable frame- Bowden is equipped to start and got a brief look in the rotation from the Commodores before they decided he was more valuable in the bullpen. The Rockies also value him more as a reliever who still could rush to the Majors despite losing what would have been his first full pro season.

CC sophomore in 2015 drew the attention of the Astros' analytical staff and an impressive pre-Draft workout sold their scouts- so they signed him for $100-000 as a 12th-rounder. A mediocre pro debut relegated him to extended spring training at the start of 2016- but once he got into games he led the Minors in hitting at .358. He encored by batting .290- ranking third in the Minors with 94 walks and reaching Double-A last season.  A scout who really believes in Straw could slap at least plus grades on four of his five tools- yet there's still concern whether he can make enough impact at the plate to merit regular playing time in the big leagues. He's a right-handed hitter with an extreme opposite-field approach that has yielded plenty of singles but just two homers in his first three years as a pro. He may not draw nearly as many walks in the Majors if pitchers have no reason to fear challenging him.  Straw's best tool is his plus-plus speed and he did a better job of parlaying it into stolen bases last year. His quickness also plays in center field- giving him plenty of range and making him one of the system's better defenders.

Thought to be a potential top 10 pick in the 2016 Draft- he slid after a positive test for a performance-enhancer. The Cardinals took a chance and drafted him closer to the end of that first round- but while he did show some tools during his pro debut that summer- he struggled in 2017 and his summer ended with a broken hand in early August.  That's the bad news. The good news is the shortstop had a productive offseason once his hand healed. That included playing for Team Puerto Rico- and manager Yadier Molina- in the Pan American U-23 Baseball Championship to earn a spot in next fall's World Cup. In addition to getting him more playing time- the Cardinals wanted to make sure he worked on getting more physical. Perez has solid bat-to-ball skills and drew some walks- even when struggling- but a serious lack of strength kept him from impacting the baseball. Some evaluators worry he won't be able to add the strength necessary to hit- but the Cardinals see strength in his hands and forearms and think his build will allow him to add good weight.  There's no question about Perez's defense. He has plus speed and outstanding range as a result- to go along with above-average hands and a plus arm when he needs to. Still just 19- there's time yet- but he will have to start showing more at the plate to come close to reaching the potential of a big league regular people saw leading into the Draft.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/zoyhWdJpeQU?autoplay=1,,|,1705,75,175,|,STL,,STL,,,1st rd 2016,Int'l Baseball Academy HS (PR),,|,,,,,|,ARI,0.500,XXX,|,20,20,30,60,40,60,40,30,40,60,55,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,35,65,60,60,|,,,,,,,,

Since then- he has been an enigma- with his ERA ballooning to a career-worst 5.92 in 2016- when he got demoted to Double-A and the bullpen. Almonte pitched well as a Double-A starter and Triple-A reliever last year- gave up three runs in two innings with Kansas City and had a strained rotator cuff end his season in late July. The Royals designated him for assignment in early April- as he was dealing with posterior right shoulder soreness- then sent him to the Angels for cash considerations or a player to be named later.    Even with all his inconsistency- Almonte has a pair of legitimate plus pitches in a running fastball that ranges from 92-98 mph and a deceptive changeup with sink. His changeup is so good that he was able to get by at lower levels without developing much of a breaking ball- but more advanced hitters have taken advantage of that shortcoming. Almonte lacks much feel to spin- though he's doing a better job of at least throwing strikes with a slider that's more reliable than his curveball.    Almonte did a better job of finding the strike zone last year after his control and command fell apart during his disastrous 2016.

Seven games in with his new organization- Longhi's left elbow popped- requiring Tommy John surgery in mid-July.  Longhi had a reputation of being one of the most advanced hitters in Boston's system and he was off to a good start with Cincinnati before he got hurt. He's hit over power- with a patient approach and an ability to make hard contact to all fields. His swing path doesn't lend itself to a ton of power- but he has the bat speed and strength to drive the ball more than he has- and there was a small uptick in power in 2017.     A better athlete than some give him credit for- Longhi has seen time at first and an outfield corner- with more at the former of late.

He steadily advanced to Triple-A by 2016 and immediately joined the White Sox after St. Louis traded him for Zach Duke that July- singling in his first at-bat but tearing his left hamstring later in the game and requiring season-ending surgery. Chicago expected him to be its center fielder and leadoff man in 2017- but a stress reaction in his right foot and a stress fracture in his right ankle caused him to miss the entire regular season.  Tilson fits the classic leadoff profile- using a compact left-handed swing and balanced approach to make regular line-drive contact and get on base. Once there- he has the well above-average speed to swipe bases and make things happen. Though he doesn't have much power- he has put on 20 pounds since turning pro and can sting some balls to the gaps.  His quickness also plays well in center field- where he can range from gap to gap.

The left-hander started out as a 28th-round Draft pick back in 2011 out of Glendale Community College. Devoloped initially as a starter- he moved to the bullpen in 2014 and started putting up numbers at the upper levels without much fanfare- earning Pacific Coast League All-Star honors in 2016 and 17. Ignored in the Rule 5 Draft- Sherriff finally got added to the roster and called up to the big leagues for the first time in August of last year.    It was an opportunity well-earned and Sherriff largely did what he was supposed to do- keeping left-handed hitters to a .080 batting average over 25 at-bats. That should come as no surprise- given he'd kept lefties to averages under .200 in Triple-A the last two seasons. Sherriff comes at hitters with a funky arm angle that brings in fastballs up to 93-94 mph and thrown with a ton of sink that gets a lot of groundball outs. He complements that with a very good slider- which when coming from his lower arm slot- is death to lefties.    This has the chance to be one of those outstanding player development stories of perseverance. As long as he keeps throwing his fastball-slider combination for strikes- and he has for most of his career- there's no reason to believe he can' be a big league reliever for many years to come.,,,,,|,2589,73,185,|,,,STL,,,,,,|,,,,,|,MIL,1.642,V,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,,,55,,,,50

Reed gets a lot of swings and misses in the strike zone with his fastball- leading to a career 9.8 K/9 rate. But he doesn't do it with velocity; his fastball registers as just average on the radar gun. He hides the ball well- with the ball seemingly coming out of his jersey at times- so hitters don't get comfortable swings at it. His slider will flash above-average at times- then it will back up and come in fringy. He's gotten more consistent in landing it for strikes and he'll mix in a decent changeup with some fade as well.    Reed's control has improved over time- but his overall command will have to get better as he moves up the ladder.

He entered last year as the best mound prospect in the upper levels of the system- but returning nearby where he grew up to pitch for Double-A Tennessee proved to be too much of a distraction. He got hammered to the tune of a 7.99 ERA during the final three months- earning a mandate from club officials to get stronger mentally and physically.    During his breakout 2016 season- Clifton operated with a 91-94 mph fastball that touched 97- flashed a plus curveball and improved his changeup. Last year- he lost weight and his stuff regressed- with his fastball dropping into the upper 80s and his curveball deserting him. He tried to rely more on a slurvy slider without success and his changeup also lacked effectiveness.    Control and command never were Clifton's strong suits and they also took a step back in 2017. He has toned down his delivery since entering pro ball but it still some features some effort- so there long have been questions whether he'd be better suited for relief work. He moved near the Cubs' training base in Arizona so he could better prepare for 2018.,,,,,|,1158,76,170,|,,,CHC,,,,,,|,,,,,|,BOS,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,55,50,50,50,,,,45

That pitchability remains his calling card- and though his stuff hasn't ticked up the way some anticipated- he's still had success- finishing sixth in the system in ERA in 2017.  Velocity-wise- Woodford's fastball is about average- with a four-seamer that tops out at around 94 mph- but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. His changeup is solid average and his slider- while inconsistent- might get to Major League average as well. But more than anything- Woodford is a strike-throwing groundball pitcher- one who is efficient with his pitches and able to log innings when he's at his best. He may never be a big swing-and-miss guy- but there is the chance that there is a bit more in the tank stuff wise given that he'll be just 21 for all of the 2018 season.  The right-hander gets high marks for his work ethic and for understanding who he is as a pitcher.

After the Red Sox signed the redshirt junior for a slightly below-slot $350-000 as a fourth-rounder- he told them that though the Beavers had him focus on two pitches- he also threw a curveball and changeup. He worked only 11 1/3 innings in his pro debut- but that was enough to show the makings of a possible mid-rotation starter.  Thompson's 92-94 mph sinker and 82-85 mph slider with bite both can be plus pitches. He also took to using a four-seam fastball more often- peaking at 98 mph with armside run. He flashed a plus changeup during his debut and mixed in a curve that should be at least average.  With a deeper repertoire- Thompson has a better chance of remaining a starter. In college- several scouts projected him as a reliever because he lacks a smooth delivery and didn't have much success in his first three seasons at Oregon State (missing most of 2015 with a back injury).

Signed for $25-000- Laureano broke out in '16- batting .319/.428/.528 with 15 homers and 43 steals and leading the Minors in on-base percentage. While playing at a launching pad at Class A Advanced Lancaster boosted his numbers- he performed even better in Double-A and continued to stand out in the Arizona Fall League. But after he regressed across the board at Double-A in 2017- hitting .225/.296/.367 in his worst full-season campaign- and with Houston facing a 40-man roster crunch- Laureano become property of the A's in a November trade.   Though he's far from punch-less at the plate- Laureano stands out more for his hitting ability than his power. He has good patience and uses the entire field- though there are growing concerns about how much his simple right-handed swing will translate into power against better pitching. If he can cut down his strikeout rate and regain his once impressive feel for the zone- he could become a high-OBP player with 10-15 homers per year. Even if he doesn't- Laureano's strong track record against left-handed pitching could help him carve out a reserve role.  Provided he can get back on track with his bat- Laureano could fit nicely in the leadoff spot because he pairs his on-base skills with plus speed and the know-how to steal bases. He's more of an average defender in center field- better on the corners and capable of playing all three spots thanks to plus arm strength that produced a Texas League-best 16 assists in 2017.,,,,,|,1698,71,185,|,,,OAK,,,,,,|,,,,,|,MIA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,40,60,60,55,|,,,,,,,,

They did try to strategically use their small bonus pool and went over pick value to sign Jackson out of the Florida high school ranks- and away from playing for the Florida Gators- in the sixth round. He played sparingly on a Gulf Coast League roster that had two other catchers on it during his pro debut.    Jackson is a left-handed-hitting catcher- something always in demand- one with power potential at the plate and a power arm behind it. He's capable of making loud contact with solid bat speed and while there's swing and miss potential- he draws walks and can drive the ball- with the chance for future Major League power. His arm will flash plus at times and he threw out 31.5 percent of potential basestealers during his debut- albeit in a very small sample size- He's not overly athletic or agile- so he'll have to work on his overall receiving.

While he's mostly lived up to that reputation in the pro ranks- Martin's bat remains a work in progress. Knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus sidelined Martin early in his first full season- and he produced uneven results at the plate in the Class A Advanced California League once finally healthy before a late-season promotion to Double-A Midland based on his defensive merits. Returning to the Texas League in 2017- Martin's offensive woes deepened. He mustered just a .224 average in 86 games in Texas League- prompting a demotion from the A's back to Stockton. Martin began 2018 in extended spring training as he recovers from his second offseason knee surgery in the past three years to repair a torn meniscus.  Martin's impressive range at shortstop is a product of his athleticism and above-average speed- and scouts rave about his first-step quickness as well as his overall instincts. His arm is a clean fit at the position and enables him to make highlight-reel plays- but he's also capable of getting rid of the ball quickly while on the move- without sacrificing any accuracy.  There's still some hope for Martin's bat- but his .235 average and .330 slugging percentage in his first three seasons certainly is not what the A's were expecting. He shows good bat-to-ball skills- doesn't strike out much and reaches base at a solid clip. His right-handed swing- however- yields excessive weak contact- as he all too often rolls over balls on the ground while offering little in the way of gap power- let alone over-the-fence pop.

His offensive numbers dipped following a promotion to Double-A that June and didn't rebound in 2017- though he has hit the ball with more authority in Triple-A this season.  Ibanez's best tool is his bat and the hope was that he might develop along the lines of Howie Kendrick. He uses a compact right-handed swing to make repeated line-drive contact. He has gap power and the potential for double-digit home run totals- but his ability to put the ball in play so easily cuts into his walk totals.  Though Ibanez won Cuba's equivalent of a Gold Glove as an 18-year-old in 2011- he's merely a defender with fringy speed and average arm strength. He has seen action at third base but doesn't have the power desired at that position.

The 6-foot-7 righty struggled in his first full season with A's but has since rebounded after making an adjustment to his delivery. He pitched well in 2017 in his return to the hitter-friendly Class A Advanced California League- then built on that performance in his first Double-A exposure following a June promotion. The Cardinals acquired him from the A's at the start of the 2018 season for reliever Josh Lucas  Meisner's velocity began to tick up in 2015- with the right-hander sitting at 90-93 mph and at times bumped the mid-90s- but adopting a lower arm slot last season negated that progress while also changing the shape and angle of his curveball and hindering his control. Although his velocity returned in 2017- when he sat 90-92 mph and reached 95- Meisner was less efficient in using his height to create downhill plane to the plate. Meisner's curveball and changeup both project to be slightly above-average pitches- and he's also adept at mixing in a below-average slider.  Meisner shows the makings of becoming a back-of-the-rotation innings-eater with his size- durability and deep arsenal.

While things haven't been all bad -- he did reach Triple-A for the first time in 2017 -- it hasn't gone quite as well as planned. The Twins left him unprotected from the Rule 5 Draft this offseason and he went undrafted.  The hope had been that Stewart- as he focused on pitching only and matured- would find increased velocity and be a power-type frontline starter. He has both a four- and two-seamer- with the former topping out at around 95 mph and the other thrown with decent sink in the low 90s. He's been a groundball pitcher for much of his career- but he gets too reliant on the two-seamer at times. That's not just in relation to his four-seam fastball- but also in terms of how he incorporates his other pitches- a slider that can be above-average and fringy curveball and changeup.  As Stewart has struggled- invariable rumors of him returning to football have cropped up.

Becerra will still flash plus raw power from the right side of the plate- but it hasn't shown up in games since before the injury and he compiled just 22 extra-base hits in 2017.

His arm in the outfield has bounced back and might be better than average eventually. An average runner- his instincts as a defender are fringy.  Becerra was added to the 40-man roster after the 2016 season- but he was removed last offseason.

He returned to the mound fully healthy in 2016 and impressed as part of Class A Lansing's starting rotation- his first work as a starter since 2013. He continued to make strides in the role in 2017 at Class A Advanced Dunedin- showing impressive bat-missing ability while making every start.    Romano has shown plenty of arm strength post-surgery. His fastball sits comfortably at 92-94 mph- with good life and some run- and reaches 96. He gets whiffs up in the zone with the pitch but also gets hit around at times- albeit while keeping the ball in the park. Romano's power slider gives him a second above-average pitch capable of missing bats- especially against right-handed hitters- whom he held to a .192 average in '17. Neither his curveball nor his changeup is particularly advanced- and he'll need to make the latter a viable offering to be successful against lefties at higher levels.

Two broken hamates derailed him in 2015 and he didn't produce as he had in a return to the FSL in 2016. He did get headed back in the right direction with an All-Star turn back with St. Lucie for a third season.  Urena once again looks like his bat could get him to the big leagues. He is capable of driving the ball- finishing the 2017 season with 51 extra-base hits- mostly in the pitching-friendly FSL- and it's easy to see some of the 34 doubles he hit there landing over the fence as he progresses. He'll draw walks and he did make some nice adjustments at the plate last year- though he can get rotational and pull-happy at times- leading to an elevated strikeout rate.  The biggest issue is Urena's long-term defensive home. While he made some progress at third during instructs- and has played some first base- his defense has gone backwards as he's filled out.

He drew comparisons to big leaguers like Billy Butler and Mark Trumbo- with the Reds buying the bat in the fourth round of that June's Draft for an over pick value bonus of $525-000. While he hasn't quite lived up to those comps- his power bat did start showing up a bit more in 2017 as he hit his way to Double-A for the first time.    The power showed up particularly in the first half in a return engagement in the Florida State League- when he hit 15 homers and slugged .538 over 61 games to earn that promotion. He struggled a bit- with a spike in strikeouts- as he tried to adjust to the new level. He's a power-over-hit player at this point- with nearly all of his over-the-fence pop coming to his pull side. He'll need a more consistent approach- with better plate discipline- in order to find success at the upper levels and profile as an everyday corner infielder.    LaValley played first base exclusively in 2017 because of the presence of top prospect Nick Senzel at third. He'll go back to seeing time at both corners and might have to show he can handle both since he profiles more as a role player or the right-handed part of a platoon.,,,,,|,880,75,235,|,,,CIN,,,,,,|,,,,,|,TEX,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,50,30,50,40,|,,,,,,,,

The Nationals drafted him in the fourth round the following year- making Reetz the first Nebraskan prep to be picked in the top five rounds since 1996. While he has made progress in the subsequent years- especially as a defender- injuries in back-to-back years have kept Reetz from developing as hoped.   Despite having a quick right-handed swing that yields line drives across the whole field- Reetz has struggled to hit for average as a pro. The same can be said about Reetz's power- though he does hit the ball consistently harder now after learning how to better apply his lower half in 2016. Reetz continues to show plate discipline and a solid approach at the plate- qualities that some within the organization believe will help his bat to eventually come around.   Defensively- Reetz stands out most for the arm strength and catch-and-throw skills that produced a career-best caught-stealing rate of 31 percent in 2017. He continues to earn high marks for his makeup and work ethic- and club officials are quick to note his great relationship with Nats catching coordinator Michael Barrett- who has helped him to improve as a receiver and game-caller. But after logging just 230 games across his first four seasons- Reetz now faces an uphill battle towards reaching the Major Leagues.,,,,,|,821,73,195,|,,,WAS,,,,,,|,,,,,|,WAS,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,40,40,55,55,|,,,,,,,,

The Nationals have challenged Ward with aggressive full-season assignments- and he made steady progress before advancing to Double-A at age 21. Making his return to the Eastern League in 2017- Ward's production declined across the board as he battled through a wrist injury that ultimately required offseason surgery.   Ward is a patient left-handed hitter who sees a lot of pitches and takes his walks. That in turn leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss- highlighted by his career-high 27 percent strikeout rate in 2017- while also limiting the quality of his contact. Raw power was Ward's calling card as an amateur- and he started to tap into it in 2016. He didn't show that kind of pop back in Double-A- though club officials believe he'll eventually learn to get to it with regularity.  A shortstop in high school- Ward has played third base almost exclusively in the Minor Leagues. He's made gains there as he's climbed the ladder to the point where the Nationals now view him as at least adequate at the hot corner- where he continues to show above-average arm strength.,,,,,|,406,75,215,|,,,WAS,,,,,,|,,,,,|,PIT,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,50,30,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

He was able to use his on-base and defensive skills to work his way to Double-A. Sent to the Arizona Fall League to make up for some of that lost time- he was sent home early with a shoulder impingement. He was good to go to start the 2018 season- which included a position switch to third base.    Ward had a quietly solid season in 2017 in some areas- most notably in terms of his plate discipline. He has a very advanced approach at the plate- with nearly as many walks as strikeouts a year ago- leading to a career .366 on-base percentage heading into 2018. He utilizes a contact-first- line-drive approach to his hitting and rarely chases- though his power started to show up in 2018. Ward's strong arm- which allowed him to throw out just over 34 percent of potential basestealers from behind the plate- is an asset at the hot corner.    Now in the upper levels of the Angels system- Ward should be ready to help out in the near future. If his uptick in offensive production continues- combined with his on-base ability- he could develop into an everyday third baseman in the future.,,,,,|,1051,73,200,|,LAA,laa,ANA,,,1st rd 2015,Fresno State,,|,,,,,|,ATL,0.500,XXX,|,35,20,40,30,45,55,40,20,40,30,50,55,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,40,40,65,50,|,,,,,,,,

A breakout 2015 full-season debut quickly made him a popular name in trade talks- and he became the key return for Oakland in the July trade that sent Scott Kazmir to Houston. After being traded once again that offseason- this time to Milwaukee in the Khris Davis deal- Nottingham struggled to find consistency on both sides of the ball during a full season in Double-A- and then once again in his return to the level in 2017.  Nottingham's big raw power was once viewed as his carrying tool- but he has struggled to apply it in games since advancing to Double-A- where he's totaled 20 homers in 213 games over two full seasons. Some of that is tied to pitchers being able to exploit his aggressive approach- though he did make gains in that regard in 2017 by improving both his strikeout and walk rates. Yet- those adjustments haven't stopped evaluators from questioning the future utility of his offensive profile.   Nottingham's stagnation at the plate hasn't kept him from making significant strides behind it- though- and club officials were very impressed with his improved catch-and-throw skills and overall progress as a blocker and receiver in 2017- when he threw out 40 percent of attempted basestealers in the Southern League. It's enough for the club to view him as a potential big league backup who could still emerge as an everyday player if the bat and power come around.,,,http://www.youtube.com/embed/a8PZOBviMVk?autoplay=1,,|,1164,74,230,|,MIL,mil,MIL,,,6th rd 2013,Redlands HS (CA),,|,,,,,|,BOS,0.500,XXX,|,20,30,60,30,30,60,30,40,60,30,40,60,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,40,45,30,55,50,|,,,,,,,,

After returning in late April in 2017- and pitching well in short stints- the Rays took the right-hander with the 31st overall pick in the Draft. Citing discrepencies between the pre-Draft and post-Draft MRIs- the Rays didn't sign Rasmussen. He was set to return to the Beavers' pitching staff when he required a second TJ surgery in September- missing the entire season.    At this point- it's hard to know what to expect from Rasmussen when he does come back. In all likelihood- he'd be viewed as a reliever only given his medical history- and his stuff did look good a year ago in those shorter outings. He was showing a fastball in the 92-96 mph range in his limited time back- thrown with good extension and getting swings and misses with it. He was getting back to average feel of his slider rand changeup the more he threw during OSU's postseason run a year ago.     Rasmussen does have three effective pitches and a starter's delivery- not to mention some track record of success in that role. But after two elbow surgeries- his future almost certainly has to be in a bullpen- where his stuff does play up.,,,|,2125,74,225,|,,,,MIL,185,,,,|,Oregon State,,Oregon State,RS Sophomore,|,LAA,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,|,60,45,,50,,,,50

His bat has bounced back in his return for his senior campaign- but there are still questions about his future defensive home.    Schwarz's best tool remains his tremendous raw power to all fields and his home run output kicked back up in 2018- and while he does draw walks- there is a good amount of swing and miss to his game. The son of one-time big league pitcher Jeff Schwarz does have some tools to catch- but his arm and receiving are fringe-average.     A team looking to draft him in June will be buying the bat- with the hopes things can work out behind the plate enough for him to be an offensive-minded backstop- or in the belief he'll hit enough to play first base at the next level. While he is a senior- this may not be the kind of senior discount that has become de rigeur on Day 2 of the Draft.,,,|,861,74,215,|,,,,OAK,233,,,,|,Florida,,Florida,Senior,|,CHC,0.500,XXX,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|,45,55,30,45,45,|,,,,,,,,
