His enormous talent was obvious the following year during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Appalachian League, and then even more so during his full-season debut in 2017, when, at age 18, Guerrero produced a .323/.425/.485 line with 13 homers between Class A Lansing and Class A Advanced Dunedin. He earned Midwest League All-Star honors in the process, as well as a trip to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in July before a torrid second half in the Florida State League.  Much like his father, Vlad Jr. has an elite ability to barrel the ball from the right side of the plate and generates effortless plus raw power to all fields with his combination of bat speed, physical strength and hand-eye coordination. His plate discipline is also impressive, as he accrued more walks (76) than strikeouts (62) in 2017 to finish among the Minor League leaders in on-base percentage. Moved from the outfield to third base before the season, Guerrero shows glimpses of becoming a passable defender there in spite of having below-average speed and range. His arm strength has developed into another above-average tool since signing.  As a future plus hitter with at least 30-homer potential, Guerrero boasts the offensive profile of a perennial All-Star and possible MVP candidate in his prime.

His power started showing up, and then some, in 2017, and seeing his 21 homers be a low mark in his career does not sound outlandish. While he did strike out a bit, his K rate did go down each time he moved up the Braves' ladder, with an advanced approach especially given his age. He can flat-out fly, allowing him to make 40-plus steals an annual projection, especially as he gets better at reading pitchers and cutting down his caught stealing rate. That speed works for him in the outfield as well, where he has the range for center and the arm for right field.

Jimenez began 2018 on the disabled list with a strained left pectoral muscle.  Jimenez has few peers among prospects when it comes to hitting for average and power. His massive raw pop, generated with impressive bat speed and leverage from the right side of the plate, earns him comparisons to Giancarlo Stanton. He recognizes pitches well, makes savvy adjustments, doesn't try to do too much and is making progress with his plate discipline.  Though Jimenez may not offer much beyond his bat, he still can become a superstar. As he has gotten bigger and stronger, he has slowed and now has below-average speed.

After the Tennessee product went No. 2 overall to the Reds, he's lived up to that billing, hitting his way to Double-A in his first full season and actually hitting better once he got to that advanced level.  Senzel uses a combination of strength, bat speed and an advanced approach at the plate to be an extremely dangerous hitter from the right side of the plate. He makes consistent hard contact, doesn't strike out a lot and draws walks, which points to a future of hitting over .300 and perhaps competing for batting titles. While he's not a pure power type, he did have 57 extra-base hits in 2017 and homered 10 times in 209 at-bats in Double-A. He's not a burner on the basepaths, but he is very aggressive and has excellent instincts that allow him to pick up some steals and take extra bases. His plus arm works very well from the hot corner and he's worked to improve his hands and footwork and can stay there long-term, though the Reds planned to try him out at different positions to increase his versatility.

However, his progress will slow down after he drew a 50-game suspension in February for violating the Minor League drug program.  Whitley can miss bats with all four of his pitches. His best is his fastball, a nasty combination of velocity (92-97 mph), cutting and running action plus steep downhill plane. After doing a terrific job as a high school senior of trimming what had been a soft body, he has room to add more strength and could throw harder once he does.  Whitley backs up his heater with a hard 12-to-6 curveball, a power slider that flashes late bite and a fading changeup that he already trusts.

At worst, he looks like a solid No. 3, but he has the chance to be more than that in the future.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/BbF8a3acDUU?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""ARI""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2014""","""Xavier HS (IA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""PIT""","""pit""","""PIT""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,40,55,,,,,55,60,45,60,,,,,70,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",65,50,55,,,,,60

He ranked as the low Class A Midwest League's best prospect and won a championship in the high Class A Carolina League during his first full pro season in 2015, then got traded to the Yankees as the key piece in the Aroldis Chapman trade in mid-2016. He capped that year by becoming the youngest MVP and batting champion (.403) in Arizona Fall League history and was pushing for a big league promotion last summer at age 20 before injuring his non-throwing elbow in a play at the plate, requiring Tommy John surgery that ended his 2017 season in mid-June.  Torres has exceptionally quick hands that allow him to excel from the right side of the plate and make plays in the field. Always an advanced hitter for his age, he recognizes pitches well, uses the entire field and has improved his walk and strikeout rates in each of his seasons in full-season ball. He makes adjustments easily and also has hit for more power each year as well as he has gotten stronger, projecting as a hitter who can contend for batting titles while providing 20-plus homers annually.  Though he's just an average runner, Torres covers enough ground to stick at shortstop and has the hands and arm to be a solid defender there. With Didi Gregorius entrenched at shortstop in New York, the Yankees played Torres regularly at second and third base in 2017. He could contend for a starting job at either position this year and has the tools to be a star wherever he winds up.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/1lExH63k6Rw?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2013""","""Venezuela""","""July 2, 2013 - CHC""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""NYY""","""nyy""","""NYY""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,40,55,50,40,55,55,55,60,40,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",70,55,50,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

While Bo didn't come off the board quite as early as his brother, his impressive hitting ability still got him an above-slot signing bonus of $1,100,000 as Toronto's second-round pick. He put on a hitting clinic in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League after signing, batting a robust .427/.451/.732 in 22 games, and then did so once again across two full-season levels in 2017, when he paced all Minor League hitters with a .362 average and captured Midwest League MVP honors.  Bichette proved an advanced hitter during his amateur career, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under Armour All-American Game home run derby in Chicago. He combines plus bat speed with a violent-but-controlled swing to produce tons of hard contact from line to line, and scouts like his chances of becoming a plus-or-better hitter with above-average power. He's an average runner with good range and instincts at shortstop, and the Blue Jays plan to keep him at the position for as long as they can. Some believe he's best suited for second or third base, or perhaps even left field, but so far he's passed every test at his natural position.  Much like his teammate and friend Vladimir Guerrero Jr., there seems to be no limit to Bichette's offensive ceiling.

Part of the same Plant High (Tampa) program that produced Hall of Famer Wade Boggs, he was considered the best hitter in that year's prep class. His bat stood out more than his power early in his pro career, then he got more aggressive in 2017 and smashed 25 homers while reaching Double-A at age 20.

He recognizes pitches well and makes contact more easily than most players with his power potential. He has a solid plan at the plate and traded some patience for pop last year, slugging .528 after recording a .408 mark in his first two seasons.

It's hard not to get excited about Sanchez's combination of pure stuff and feel for pitching. While he is just six feet tall, he's strong and athletic with a repeatable delivery that points to a future in a rotation. He can hit triple digits with his four-seam fastball and also features a two-seamer with a ton of sinking action. His fastball is better than its pure velocity because of its movement as well as his ability to command it extremely well. His secondary stuff continues to improve, with a breaking ball he adds and subtracts from and a changeup he shows a good feel for at times. Both will flash above-average to plus, and given his overall feel for pitching, there is confidence both will get there consistently in time.  The Phillies have understandably limited Sanchez's workload to date, but the right-hander could start forcing their hand soon.

The native of Elizabeth, N.J., who moved to the Dominican Republic in order to sign as an international free agent in 2012, had hit some stumbling blocks, including a shoulder issue in 2015 and a drug suspension in 2016, before rebounding to make a big league impact that season. Poised to establish himself in 2017, he instead required Tommy John surgery in February and missed the season, then began 2018 on the 60-day disabled list.  There is a bit of an unknown in terms of what Reyes will look like upon his return, but assuming good health, he should bring one of the most electric fastballs among all pitching prospects back to the mound. He was easily hitting triple digits before the elbow injury and sat in the mid-to-upper 90s with ease. That and a plus upper-70s curve would be enough for a bullpen gig, but his 88-90 mph changeup gives him a third above-average offering. The only negative for Reyes has been his command, and he will have to keep his walk rate relatively in check to reach his potential as a top-of-the-rotation starter.    Reports of Reyes rehabbing post-surgery were very positive, including the right-hander getting in much better shape.

Signed for $1.5 million as the 33rd overall choice in the 2014 Draft, he missed time in his first two full pro seasons when he got suspended for 50 games after testing positive for a banned stimulant (2015) and when he broke his pitching hand in a Spring Training fight with a teammate (2016). He nearly matched his previous career total with 134 1/3 innings last season, when he led the Double-A Southern League in strikeout rate (11.7 per nine innings) and opponent average (.184).  Kopech throws as hard and is as difficult to hit as any starter in the Minor Leagues, which has prompted comparisons to Noah Syndergaard. His fastball, which sits at 96-99 mph, repeatedly hits triple digits with late run that keeps it off barrels. Hitters who try to sit on his heater get embarrassed by his upper-80s slider, which features two-plane break and is a plus-plus offering at its best.  Kopech just needs some refinement before he's ready to pitch at the front of a big league rotation. He'll flash a plus changeup with sink, though it's inconsistent and often more of a fringy offering.

Honeywell reached Double-A for the first time in his second full season and then returned there to begin 2017 before advancing to Triple-A in mid-April and ultimately helping Durham win the Governor's Cup. Along the way, Honeywell was named the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game Most Valuable Player as the U.S. Team's starting pitcher, furthering his reputation as a confident, big-game hurler. However, Honeywell will now be sidelined until 2019 after he suffered a right elbow injury in February '18 that required Tommy John surgery.   Honeywell has no shortage of weapons at his disposal, as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low to mid-90s, at times touching 95-96 mph, with late sinking action and backs it with a host of secondary offerings, including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering.  Throwing strikes has never been a problem for Honeywell. His natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently, and club officials note that his command has improved as he's climbed the Minor League ladder.

Since signing for a franchise-record $5.5 million, he has produced everywhere he has gone and improved each year. He batted .336/.373/.567 with 18 homers in 89 games between high Class A and Double-A and also turned in a nifty defensive play in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in 2017, when his only setbacks were hand and quad injuries that sidelined him for a combined six weeks.  Rodgers offers more upside at the plate than most middle infielders, possessing all the tools to hit for average and power. He has a quick right-handed swing, good feel for the barrel, fine pitch-recognition skills and plenty of strength. He makes consistent hard contact, and the only quibbles with his offensive game are that he rarely walks and occasionally gets pull-conscious.  When Rodgers was in high school, scouts debated whether he was a long-term shortstop. The consensus now is that while he doesn't have the quickness and range teams typically desire there, his arm strength and instincts allow him to get the job done at short. He could be a solid defender at second or third base, though Nolan Arenado blocks him at the hot corner in Colorado.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/8R3NqST3CPs?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2015""","""Lake Mary HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""COL""","""col""","""COL""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,40,60,50,40,55,50,55,60,45,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,55,50,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The breakout performance earned Mejia a selection as the World team's starting catcher in the 2016 SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game, and he went on to finish sixth in the Minors with a .342 average. Mejia only built on that success in 2017, as he was named Eastern League Rookie of the Year, received his first taste of the Majors at age 21 in September and then had a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League while learning a new position.   The switch-hitting Mejia has natural hitting ability from both sides of the plate. Though his approach is aggressive, Mejia generates consistently hard contact to all fields thanks to his advanced bat-to-ball skills and outstanding barrel control. His physical strength and bat speed generates sneaky raw power, especially from the left side, and he's tapped into it more regularly as he's climbed the ladder.   After catching almost exclusively during his first four seasons, Mejia spent the entire AFL working at third base, where he compensated for raw footwork and actions with his cannon, plus-plus arm strength. While the Indians haven't yet given up on Mejia as a catcher, it's clear that they are eager to improve his defensive versatility, with the ultimate goal of getting his bat into the lineup regularly in 2018.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/zjm3SlBQSVM?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""ARI""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2012""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 7, 2012 - CLE""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CLE""","""cle""","""CLE""","""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",50,30,55,50,40,80,60,50,55,45,45,80,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,50,40,70,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

As a result, many scouts viewed Gore as the top prospect in his class, and the Padres were ecstatic to land the southpaw for $6.7 million after selecting him with the No. 3 overall pick. He rewarded them immediately, turning in a stellar professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League.   An uptick in velocity during Gore's senior year carried over into his pro debut, where he impressed evaluators with his feel for commanding a 92-95 mph fastball. His mid-70s curveball is a true plus pitch and nets him plenty of whiffs, while his low-80s hard slider and tumbling changeup could also grade as plus offerings at their best. Meanwhile, Gore's entire arsenal plays up due to his big, athletic leg kick and because he gets good extension toward the plate, both of which help create a deceptive look for hitters on both sides of the plate.  Padres officials are quick to praise Gore's competitiveness and overall aptitude on the mound, believing that those qualities, along with his potential for four above-average-or-better offerings, could make the young lefty a future front-of-the-rotation piece.

Full Report:  Mize was a semi-sought-after high schooler but ended up at Auburn, where he broke out on the Cape after his freshman year. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate Team USA, then took a giant leap forward this year, as a junior, when his command improved and because he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch. While he threw a sinker most of 2017, Mize now throws a flat four-seamer, up to 97 mph in most starts, but he doesn't throw it much compared to big league norms. In starts we've charted, Mize threw 37% fastballs, 32% cutters, 16% splitters and 15% sliders. Mize is unique, a nearly finished product who could probably pitch in the upper levels of the minors now, and maybe be in a rotation next year, pitching in a way that's becoming more common in the big leagues. On the down side, Mize has some head violence at release and no physical projection and also relies heavily on a new pitch (the cutter) where there's lots of anecdotal evidence that says it dimishes velocity when used often.Discussions of Mize's presumptive selection at #1 overall are always qualified by assumptive health. Mize had shoulder issues in high school that scared some teams off, he missed two starts as a sophomore with forearm tightness and experienced more forearm issues last summer with Team USA, then had non-surgical treatment on the arm in August of last year. He's still our top prospect, but by a smaller margin that some may expect, because he's a risky subset of pitcher. He's also very advanced and should move quickly, and this class lacks a standout, consensus bat to stick ahead of him. The Tigers have been zeroed in on Mize most of the spring and he's the overwhelming favorite to go 1-1.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 60 | Splitter: 70 | Control: 60 | Overall: 60  Raw and undrafted out of an Alabama high school three years ago, Mize has blossomed at Auburn and not only is a lock to join Gregg Olson (1988) and Frank Thomas (1989) as Tigers selected in the top 10 picks, but he's also the prohibitive favorite to go No. 1 overall. He has the best combination of stuff and control among college pitchers in the 2018 Draft, and he has proven he can stay healthy. Shut down last spring at Auburn and again during the summer with Team USA with a tired arm and a flexor strain in his forearm, he has had no issues this year.  Mize can get swings and misses with three different pitches, the best of which is a mid-80s splitter that dives at the plate. He sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider has taken a step forward this spring, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to turn it into a harder cutter when he desires.Mize has an athletic frame and a clean delivery, so there's no glaring flaw that can be blamed for his health concerns. He pounds the strike zone, ranking first in NCAA Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posting similar numbers as a junior. Scouts also love the way he competes on the mound.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KTLpXoKizJU?autoplay=1""","""|""","""PHI""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""DET""",1,,,,"""|""","""Auburn""","""""","""Auburn""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,1,0,1,"""|""","""""","""""","""++""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,,,60,,70,,60

They paid a $26 million bonus -- the second-highest ever given to an amateur, behind Moncada's $31 million -- and a matching amount as a penalty for exceeding their bonus pool to land Robert, a five-tool athlete who hit .401/.526/.687 as an 18-year-old in Cuba's top league in 2016. He spent his first pro summer in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League for tax purposes, battering inferior competition to the tune of .310/.491/.536, while dealing with minor knee and ankle injuries. A sprained left thumb caused Robert to open 2018 on the disabled list.  Moncada has the advantages of being a switch-hitter and an infielder, but otherwise Robert is quite similar to him. A right-handed hitter, he has a lightning-fast bat with well above-average raw power and speed to match. He also comes with some swing-and-miss concerns, though he mitigates them somewhat with his willingness to take walks.  Considered more of a solid runner while in Cuba, Robert got faster after defecting and posted sub-6.3 second 60-yard dashes while trying out for teams. His lean 6-foot-3 frame has plenty of room for additional muscle, so he'll probably slow down some as he matures physically.

After he started to put it together more in 2016, capping it off with a strong Arizona Fall League stint, the Braves acquired him in January and watched Gohara pitch across three levels of the Minors and up to the big leagues in 2017. Gohara began the year on the 10-day disabled list with a left ankle injury.  Gohara was one of the hardest-throwing -- if not the hardest-throwing -- lefties in baseball in 2017. He flirted with triple digits regularly while consistently sitting 96-98 mph. He continued to improve his slider, giving him a second plus pitch he can use to elicit swings and misses. His changeup has also improved, though he tends to throw it too hard and is still developing. Gohara will never be a pinpoint command pitcher, but his control has gotten better as he has both physically and emotionally matured.  He'll have to always keep an eye on his conditioning, but he is definitely going to be a bigger-bodied pitcher, like a David Wells type in that regard.

He has elite bat control, speed and feel, but is small, which some teams don't like and others don't care about as much.    Full Report:  Madrigal had his share of suitors coming out of a powerhouse NorCal high school, but it's hard for teams to pay a big price for a small, high school second basemen, so he matriculated to Oregon State. He's been electric there for three years, posting big numbers and maturing physically while fine-tuning his game. Madrigal was off to a raucous start in 2018 before fracturing his wrist in a benign-looking homeplate collision, scaring some teams that are worried about durability due to his small frame. He missed about two months, but still hit .395/.460/.560 over the course of the year while playing elite defense at second base, especially around the bag. Madrigal is a complete, do-everything player once you look past his size and could be in the big leagues as soon as 2019 because of how polished his skillset is.

The combination of more organizations embracing analytics and the success of players like Jose Altuve, not to mention the superb performance of the 5-foot-7 infielder, had Madrigal poised to perhaps be the top college position player taken in the 2018 Draft. A broken wrist at the start of the season slowed him down, but he returned in April swinging a hot bat.    While Madrigal might have been more of a gut feel kind of player for scouts, he now has track record on top of being a scout favorite. Analytics departments love him because of his approach at the plate that led to more walks than strikeouts in 2017, and while he doesn't have a ton of over-the-fence power, he makes consistent hard contact and is a legitimate extra-base threat. His speed and instincts should allow him to continue to be a base stealer.    While Madrigal has played mostly second base in deference to Cadyn Grenier at Oregon State, some feel he could handle shortstop if need be.

He was an All-Star once again in 2017, this time in the Triple-A International League, as he overcame a slow start to have a torrid second half and help lead Durham to the Governor's Cup.   Adames has hit at every stop in his career despite being a younger player in each league, showing a combination of plus bat speed and barrel control that consistently produces hard, line-drive contact from line to line. Adames' approach is similarly advanced, as his knowledge of the strike zone and knack for working deep counts nets him plenty of walks and fuels his on-base skills. His power has come along as he's climbed the ladder, resulting in at least 10 home runs and 30 doubles in back-to-back seasons, and scouts expect he'll offer at least average power at maturity. Defensively, Adames compensates for his average speed with excellent instincts and quick feet at shortstop, where he profiles as a plus defender with soft hands, smooth footwork and plus arm strength.  Adames has long received praise from club officials for his plus makeup and leadership skills, both on and off the field. He has all the ingredients to develop into an All-Star-caliber shortstop capable of hitting in the middle of a lineup and could soon be ready for his first taste of the Majors.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/b0XEzkgl-EQ?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CHA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2012""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 2, 2012 - DET""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TBR""","""tb""","""TB""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",45,45,55,45,45,60,55,55,55,40,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,50,60,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Though little was known about him at the time, Baez put himself on the radar during his dominant stateside debut, showing a combination of physicality and stuff that enabled him to quickly jump to Class A Fort Wayne after just one start in the Rookie Arizona League.  A physically large and imposing presence on the mound who operates from a three-quarters slot, Baez generates easy plus-plus velocity in a fastball that bumps 98-99 mph and consistently sits in the mid-90s. His heater pairs nicely with an upper-80s slider that flashes above-average potential with two-plane action, and club officials expect both his curveball and changeup to be at least average once fully developed.   Though listed at 6-foot-8 and 220 pounds, Baez showed in 2017 that he could repeat his delivery and pound the strike zone better than most hurlers of comparable size.

Drafted fourth overall by Tampa Bay in June, McKay received the second-highest signing bonus ($7,007,500) under the current set of Draft rules, and then continued his two-way career during an impressive pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League.   McKay operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that he commands well against hitters on both sides of the plate, though his velocity is prone to dipping as he works deeper into games. Both his curveball and cutter project to be above-average pitches, and he showed good feel for a changeup during his pro debut after using it sparingly at Louisville.   At the plate, McKay's smooth left-handed swing and mature all-fields approach led some evaluators to label him the best college bat in his class as a potential .300 hitter capable of hitting 20 homers per season.

Lewis has outstanding athleticism on both sides of the ball. When you combine that with his baseball IQ, it's easy to see a future star. At the plate, he barrels the ball up consistently and has extra-base authority to all fields, with more power to come for sure. He showed an advanced approach at the plate with the ability to draw walks, which should give him more opportunities to use his plus speed on the basepaths. There were some questions about whether Lewis would be a shortstop long term, or need to move to center, but he has good range and hands and might have just enough arm to stay on the dirt. The Twins plan to keep him there, at least for the time being.  Lewis will be an impact up-the-middle player in either case.

He's since blossomed in Oakland's system, as Barreto made the jump straight to the California League the next year before finishing sixth in the Texas League batting race (.281) in 2016. That offensive success would follow Barreto to Triple-A in 2017, although he struggled mightily at the plate overall during two stints in the Majors after homering in his big league debut.  Barreto's potent bat is his calling card, as he's long showed the potential to hit for both average and power. His quick right-handed bat and feel for the barrel yields hard, line-drive contact across the entire field, and he's started to tap into more game power as he's climbed the ladder. His propensity to swing-and-miss stems from an aggressive approach and below-average pitch recognition, both of which he'll need to refine in order to adjust to big league pitching. Barreto has slightly above-average speed and likes to run, though he still has many gains to make as a basestealer.  A fringy defender at shortstop where he shows a plus arm but inconsistent hands and actions, Barreto is a better long-term fit at second base, where he has a chance to become an average defender. Regardless of his ultimate position, Barreto will need to become a more selective hitter to carve out an everyday role in the Majors.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KuHQqKfcO_I?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""MIN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2012""","""Venezuela""","""July 2, 2012 - TOR""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""OAK""","""oak""","""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",50,45,60,60,40,60,55,55,60,60,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,55,60,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He still ended up going sixth overall to the A's and signed for $4,069,200, the largest bonus for a pitcher in franchise history. Puk lived up to the hype in his first full season, as the left-hander garnered California League All-Star honors before advancing to Double-A in June and then appearing in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game the following month. However, his progress has been delayed by Tommy John surgery that will require him to miss all of 2018.   Puk has elite bat-missing ability, a notion supported by his Minor League-leading 13.2 strikeouts-per-nine in 2017. He induces many of those whiffs with his plus fastball-slider pairing, as he'll operate at 93-97 mph with his heater to set up a devastating mid- to upper-80s slider. Puk also features a curveball and changeup, both of which improved as the season progressed. What's more, Puk's entire arsenal plays up because he gets tremendous extension from his 6-foot-7 frame.  Puk made strides as a strike-thrower in his first full season after making an adjustment to his delivery early in the year. His control and command should continue to improve as he learns to control his long levers and repeat his delivery with greater consistency. With further gains on that front, and the development of a more effective changeup to use against right-handed hitters, Puk could achieve his ceiling of a No. 2 starter.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dF78XZniyhY?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""DET""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Florida""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""OAK""","""oak""","""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,55,55,60,,,,45,65,60,60,60,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,50,45,65,,,,45

He made an immediate impact by reaching full-season Class A during his pro debut, and then emerged as one of the Minor Leagues' top breakout hurlers in 2017, much of which he spent in Double-A. Burnes ultimately finished second in the Minors with a 1.67 ERA, netting him honors as Milwaukee's MiLB pitcher of the year.   Scouts rave about Burnes' lightning-quick arm, as it produces a 92-95 mph fastball that has natural cutting action out of his hand. He pounds the strike zone with the pitch, using it to attack hitters on both sides of the plate, and maintains velocity deep into starts. Burnes' above-average curveball, thrown with a high spin rate and late, downer action, is his best secondary offering, and he also shows advanced feel for a mid-80s slider. An effective changeup that has splitter-like action in the mid- to upper-80s rounds out Burnes' four-pitch mix, all of which play up due to his above-average control.   Burnes' rapid ascent through Milwaukee's system speaks both to his overall ability as well as his capacity to make key adjustments. An improved, more efficient delivery has helped assuage concerns about the righty's durability, leaving little doubt about his ability to stick as a big league starter.

Although a right elbow injury limited him to designated hitter duties and portended eventual surgery, the Brewers, undeterred by Hiura's injury, were thrilled to add him to their system, signing Hiura for below slot value at $4 million. He immediately rewarded his new club with an outstanding pro debut, highlighted by an impressive performance after a promotion to Class A Wisconsin, and then returned to the field in earnest during instructional league.   Hiura has a short, impactful right-handed stroke with a ton of bat speed and outstanding feel for the barrel. He projects to hit for a high average and shows at least average in-game power, with the ball coming off of his bat differently than most to all fields. Though not a basestealing threat, Hiura does possess average speed and earns high marks for his baserunning and awareness.   A post-Draft MRI led the Brewers to believe that Hiura could make a successful recovery without needing surgery. He did just that, completing a throwing program in Rookie ball before appearing in games at second base without issue during instructs. He's a passable defender at the keystone, where he has decent actions and footwork, though some believe he's ultimately destined for left field. Regardless of his future defensive home, Hiura's potent bat is his calling card to a lengthy career in the Majors.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wgVOB9lK0Z8?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2017""","""UC Irvine""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIL""","""mil""","""MIL""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,40,55,50,40,40,60,55,55,50,50,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",65,50,50,50,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Urias stands out as much for his approach and plate discipline as he does for his pure hitting ability. He has an advanced knowledge of the strike zone as well as excellent pitch recognition, a combination that netted him the Texas League's top on-base percentage (.398) in 2017, and has resulted in more walks (153) than strikeouts (135) in four professional seasons. Urias' bat-to-ball skills are impressive, and he produces hard line drives across the entire field with a compact, level swing.

Though he would ultimately sign for $750,000, Alford   spent most of 2012-14 on the gridiron, eventually transferring to Mississippi as a defensive back before deciding to play baseball full-time. Despite his time off, Alford excelled in his first full season, though two separate trips to the disabled list for a knee injury and a concussion, respectively, hindered his progress in 2016. After a strong start to his 2017 campaign with Double-A New Hampshire, Alford was called up for his big league debut in May, only to suffer a broken hamate bone and land on the disabled list for two months. The injury bug struck Alford again in Spring Training, with a Grade 2 hamstring strain delaying his start to the 2018 season.  Alford generates good bat speed and makes a lot of hard contact from the right side of the plate. His mature approach and solid pitch recognition translate to plenty of walks and strong on-base skills that fuel his potential as a true top-of-the-order hitter. He has the strength and swing plane to drive the ball out of the park, shows good raw power to center field and could clear more fences as he continues to refine his approach. Alford's knee injury diminished his speed last season, but he's still a plus, if not better runner capable of impacting games on the bases as well as in center field, where he has plus range but a below-average arm.  Alford didn't receive another crack at the Majors in September because the Blue Jays felt it was more important for him to receive guaranteed at-bats in Triple-A while making up for lost time. Meanwhile, Alford's transformation from a raw athlete into a well-rounded and polished ballplayer in a short amount of time understandably has club officials excited about his bright future.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/lU6bw7GGXcs?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""3rd rd 2012""","""Petal HS (MS)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""","""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,40,60,70,50,40,45,50,60,70,60,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,70,45,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

McKenzie's prospect stock took flight in 2016 as he earned All-Star honors in the New York-Penn League before advancing to full-season ball at age 18. Spending all of 2017 with Class A Advanced Lynchburg, McKenzie paced the Carolina League in strikeouts (186) and finished second among qualified pitchers in WHIP (1.05), earning a trip to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game along the way. The right-hander began the season on Lynchburg's disabled list as a precautionary move after he experienced forearm soreness during spring camp.  McKenzie stands out for his present blend of pitchability and physical projection. His velocity has improved some as he's begun to grow into his wiry athletic frame, and it's easy to envision him adding a few more ticks with further physical development. He has a feel for locating his low-90s fastball throughout the zone, all while using his height to create good angle toward the plate. McKenzie's curveball, thrown with tight spin and loads of depth, flashes plus and nets him plenty of whiffs, and he shows a similarly advanced feel for throwing an above-average, fading changeup. Above-average control and overall efficiency enable his entire arsenal to play up.  McKenzie was one of the youngest players in his Draft class, but he's quickly proved more advanced than most of his peers while making a quick climb through Cleveland's system.

Full Report:  Swaggerty was a new name to most scouts last summer when he starred as the sparkplug for collegiate Team USA, playing center field and batting atop the lineup along with Madrigal. Swaggerty showed bat control and gap power, and was a fringe first rounder for many off that first, extended look, but he came out this spring looking like a different player. He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength, lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power, arm strength and speed. Swaggerty didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference and who had a summer of good performance with wood bats against strong competition, because Swaggerty's new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times, causing him to lose balance andbe in a poor position to hit. He was hot fearly in the year, then had another hot streak in April, but some high level evaluators (and us) saw him multiple times only during intermittent slumps, which could make it tough for teams to pick him early when the stats and your eyes both say that hit tool is questionablel. We think at least average offense is in there, Swaggerty just needs to dial in the swing mechanics and an approach that takes best advantage of his tools, which are arguably tops in the class. Swaggerty seemed like a likely top-5 overall pick but it sounds like he may slide out of the top 6 due to some uneven late season games.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  South Alabama has sent two dozen players to the big leagues in the Draft era but has never had a first-round pick, a void that Swaggerty will fill in June as one of the first college position players selected. Undrafted and lightly regarded as a Louisiana high schooler, he reached double figures in homers and steals as a sophomore in 2016. He also impressed with Team USA last summer, with some scouts considering him the best position prospect on the squad, and continued to show all-around tools this spring.Swaggerty is an on-base machine thanks to his speed (which earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators) and patient approach. A left-handed hitter, he does swing and miss a bit much for a player with a leadoff profile because he can get overly aggressive at times, especially against breaking pitches. Though he didn't go deep in 64 at-bats with wood bats on Team USA, he packs some sneaky power in his athletic frame and could produce 20 or more homers per season in the big leagues.  Swaggerty also uses his quickness well to steal bases and track down balls in center field. He throws better than most players at his position -- his fastball reached 92 mph when he was a high school pitcher -- and his makeup is another positive in his favor. The most common comparison is Brett Gardner, though Gardner had less pop and more speed at the same stage of his career.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qTYA7IA0cCQ?autoplay=1""","""|""","""KC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""PIT""",10,,,,"""|""","""South Alabama""","""""","""South Alabama""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""","""+""","""-""","""""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,60,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Spencer made his big league debut late in '16, the same year Washington took Carter, the youngest of three baseball-playing brothers, with its first of back-to-back picks late in the first round. Regarded by scouts as one of the best prep hitters in his class, Carter signed for below slot at $2 million and then flashed his offensive potential in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Assigned to Class A Hagerstown for his first full season, Kieboom got off to a torrid start by hitting for average and power in the South Atlantic League, only to suffer a hamstring injury and land on the disabled list roughly a month into his campaign.  Kieboom has a knack for barreling the baseball, a product of his plus bat speed, hand-eye coordination and mature approach. He was aggressive to a fault at times and showed some swing-and-miss tendencies during his pro debut, though his approach appeared more refined in 2017, leading scouts to project him as a future above-average hitter. Kieboom gets good loft to his right-handed swing, too, so much so that he should have at least average power once he fills out physically.   Kieboom's average speed plays up thanks to his quick feet and excellent instincts. Those tools, along with his solid range and above-average arm strength, give him a chance to stick at shortstop, although some believe he'll eventually end up at third base. Regardless of his ultimate defensive home, it will be Kieboom's bat that gets him to the big leagues.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIz5j-OJPrY?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Walton HS (GA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""WSN""","""was""","""WAS""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,30,55,50,45,55,55,55,60,45,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,50,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

As they have with previous prep arms, the Braves sent Anderson to full-season Rome for his first full professional year, and he was up for the challenge, pitching extremely well while under fairly tight usage restrictions.  Anderson already shows the makings of three pitches that have the chance to be above-average to plus, along with a willingness to work tirelessly on his craft. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-96 mph range and will sit consistently around 93-94 mph. Tall and projectable, he throws with excellent downhill angle, showing the ability to both miss bats and generate weak contact on the ground. He gets swings and misses with a curve that can be plus at times. Anderson's greatest leap forward came with his changeup. He worked hard on the offspeed pitch last offseason and it showed, as it was a plus pitch for him on occasion. While his walk rate was high during his first full season, there aren't overarching concerns about his command.  The gloves could come off a bit for Anderson in 2018, though with the depth in the system, there's no reason to rush him.

Pache is the best defender in the entire Braves system, and might be the best defensive center fielder in the Minor Leagues.

The 6-foot-1 southpaw thrives with a three-pitch mix that starts with outstanding fastball command. He throws his heater in the 88-93 mph range, but it plays up because of its movement and because of Allard's ability to move it in and out with ease. That can occasionally get him into trouble, as he falls in love with his fastball command and pitches off of his fastball too much. His changeup, once his third offering, is now a plus pitch and Allard would often fall into a fastball-changeup pattern. That's something that isn't necessary, given he still possesses a plus curve.

A mid-season All-Star in his return to Class A Advanced Tampa in 2017, Mateo reached Double-A Trenton for the first time in June and was hitting .300/.381/.525 when the Yankees dealt him to Oakland as part of the Trade Deadline blockbuster for Sonny Gray. He continued to produce as Double-A Midland's shortstop after the trade and ultimately played a major role in helping the Rockhounds secure their fourth straight Texas League title.

He led the Minors with 82 steals in 2015 and tied for third with 52 in '17 to push his career total to 234 stolen bases in his first six pro seasons. Mateo's wheels are equally dynamic out of the box, as he regularly turns in top-of-the-scale run times from home to first. His deceptive strength translates to sneaky raw power and he has an offensive ceiling of a .275 hitter with 15 homers per season, though he'll need to tighten his plate discipline to become a quality leadoff man.  Mateo has the raw tools to stick at shortstop, most notably outstanding range and plus arm strength, though his consistency and focus in the field still leave something to be desired.

He took to it quickly, earning $1 million to sign with the Astros in 2014. The best term to describe the young right-hander has been precocious, as he has shown an advanced feel for pitching given his age. He reached Double-A at age 19 in 2017 before being the marquee prospect sent to the Tigers in the Justin Verlander trade at the end of August. Excitement for his Tigers debut in 2018 was dampened by a lat strain that is expected to keep him out for an extended period of time to start the season.    Perez has four pitches at his disposal, all of which he can throw for strikes. He generally throws his lively fastball in the 92-94 mph range, but he can reach back for 95-96 mph when he needs to. Added velocity could come as he matures. He can really spin his curveball, a future plus offering, and he's taken to a relatively new slider as well. He throws his above-average changeup with solid fade. With an athletic and repeatable delivery, he should continue to command the ball well even if he adds velocity.    The Verlander trade happened too late for Perez to make his Tigers debut in 2017, and now the Tigers will have to be more patient in waiting for him to be healthy.

The Kentucky high school star was his state's Gatorade Player of the Year and led all high school hitters with 25 home runs. While there was some concern about his ability to hit, the Angels liked the upside enough to take him No. 10 overall and sign him for full pick value. He then went out and showed off all of those tools across two levels of rookie ball during his pro debut.    While no one questions Adell's raw power and bat speed from the right side, some were concerned with his ability to make enough contact to tap into it due to some swing-and-miss tendencies that showed up against top competition on the summer showcase circuit. There were some strikeouts during his debut, but he impressed the Angels with his ability to make adjustments and drive the ball to all fields. A tremendous athlete with plus speed, Adell has the chance to continue to be a basestealing threat long term. It also helps give him plenty of range to patrol center, though he didn't play the outfield last summer because of a minor shoulder issue. His plus arm, which fired upper-90s fastballs from the mound in high school, would also work in right.    Even with the exciting debut, patience will be key in the dynamic outfielder's development.

Fields, who had a 6.89 ERA for Houston at the time of the deal, pitched well in the 2016 and 2017 regular seasons for Los Angeles but gave up two runs without recording an out in Game 2 of the World Series last fall, helping turn the Fall Classic in Houston's favor.

Taveras is a switch-hitter with a good swing from both sides of the plate -- the consensus is that he's better as a left-handed hitter -- and he already displays command of the strike zone and the ability to recognize pitches. Add in his plus speed and he should have little difficulty hitting for average.

Some scouts believed that Bukauskas had the best 1-2 combination of pitches in the 2017 Draft. Both his mid-90s fastball with sink and his mid-80s slider are at least plus-plus pitches at their best, though he sometimes falls in love with his slider too much and loses fastball command. He'll flash some solid changeups with some armside run, though he needs to employ the pitch more often so he can refine it.  Bukauskas toned down his delivery in college, but he's still a 6-foot right-hander who throws with considerable effort, so there's a split camp among evaluators as to whether he can remain a starter.

Though his build is somewhat soft and he lacks physical projection, he has the prototypical pitcher's frame, a good delivery and plenty of present stuff and feel. Winn's fastball has flat plane and lives up in the zone, which nicely compliments his 12-6, snapdragon curveball which flashes plus and has a plus spin rate. He's also the best high school sequencer in the draft, able to locate any of his offspeed pitches in various effective locations and throw them for strikes to start at-bats. He projects as an above-average big league starter and is relatively polished for a prep arm, so he could move quickly.

That has given the projectable right-hander a lot more exposure and from USA Baseball's National High School Invitatitonal and throughout the spring, the Texas Christian commit has risen to the occasion.    Winn's spring has moved him up to the upper-echelon group of high school arms. He flashes three plus pitches, carrying his fastball deep into starts and showing an improved slider with new life. His slider was more of a cutter at first, with not a ton of tilt to it, then it was slurvy, and now it's often a plus three-quarters power breaker he throws for strikes. He's not afraid to throw a changeup when he needs it, but he doesn't need it. With his clean and easy delivery, he should develop more consistent command.

Strong and athletic, Duplantier has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success. While his fastball usually sits in the 92-94 mph range, he can reach back for more when needed. He throws it with sink and run and was as effective in getting ground-ball outs as he was in missing bats in 2017.

His issues aren't hard to correct.    Full Report:  Gorman hit well on the summer showcase circuit as a rising senior and was generally considered to be the best high school hitter in the country entering his senior year. His body, defense and ability to hit breaking balls all backed up this spring, but most of the industry thinks these things are fixable or insignificant. Gorman's long hand path should be relatively easy for pro coaches to fix and a pro conditioning program should make him viable at third as long as Gorman works at it, and teams buy that he has the makeup to do it. As long as Gorman identifies pro breaking balls, his huge raw power -- visually, scouts have 70s on it but Gorman's summer exit velos were top of the scale for his age -- will play in games. He should be off the board after pick 8 or 9.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 60 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55    If a player's Draft status was tied directly to home run derby performances, Gorman might be the No. 1 pick in the Draft. The Arizona prep infielder took long ball crowns at the MLB All-Star Game High School Home Run Derby in Miami and at the Under Armour All-American Game at Wrigley Field in Chicago.    The left-handed hitter has as much raw power as anyone in the class, with some scouts giving it as high as a 70 grade on the 20-to-80 scale. And it is power that does show up in games, though he didn't swing the bat consistently well all summer. There are some holes in his swing, which will lead to some swing and miss, but those who have seen him when he's locked in have seen his ultra-quick hands and bat speed. He did show that he can make hard contact against good competition at times over the summer, though he'd been a bit inconsistent this spring. One concern was whether he could stick at third, and while Gorman showed well at the hot corner at a variety of summer events, some of those worries did resurface this spring.    If a scouting director saw Gorman at the right time, he might think of the University of Arizona commit as a top 10 pick and one of the best high school hitters in the country. Even with an up-and-down senior season, he still looks like one of the better power hitting prospects in the class.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_2qk0vq7IEA?autoplay=1""","""|""","""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""STL""",19,,,,"""|""","""O'Connor HS AZ""","""Arizona""","""O'Connor (Ariz.)

But then the injury bug, which has plagued him throughout his career, derailed his season. While he'll still be just 23 years old for nearly all of 2018, recurring hamstring issues have clouded his outlook a bit.  When Meadows has been able to stay on the field, he's shown the plus hit tool that made him a top 10 pick. He has a very smooth left-handed swing, still largely generated for contact, to go along with an advanced approach at the plate that allows him to draw walks and limit strikeouts. His power started to show up more in 2016, but wasn't there during his healthy time the following season. He runs well, covering a lot of ground in the outfield and stealing bases, though some wonder how the hamstring injuries will impact that part of his game. He's capable of playing center field, though some see a move to left in his future, where there will be more pressure for the power to show up more consistently.  Despite the injuries, Meadows is still ahead of the curve from an age/level standpoint.

His performance during instructional league inspired the Nationals to send him stateside for his pro debut the next year, and the young outfielder rewarded the organization by winning the Gulf Coast League MVP Award en route to a late-season promotion to Class A Short-Season Auburn. Beset by injuries in 2017, Soto missed time due to an ankle injury, a broken hamate bone and a hamstring injury, respectively, though he still finished with a .360 average in his first taste of full-season ball.   Soto possesses natural hitting and plays well beyond his years. His left-handed swing is smooth and rhythmic, allowing Soto to consistently barrel the ball and generate hard contact from line to line. He has the bat speed and barrel control to handle good fastballs and also receives raves for his ability to recognize spin at a young age. He already has good strength to his frame with more room to grow, and scouts expect that his feel for hitting will help him get to his well above-average raw power in games. Defensively, Soto has spent the bulk of his time in right field, where his average speed and arm strength are clean fits.  Soto has the makings of a middle-of-the-order hitter and a potential batting champion at maturity, especially if he can continue to add power in the coming years.

That success followed Hays into his first full season, as he erupted to hit .329 with 32 home runs and 32 doubles between Class A Advanced Frederick and Double-A Bowie to earn a September callup. The first hitter from his Draft class to reach the Majors, Hays appeared in 20 games for the Orioles during the final month-plus of the regular season.  Hays features a short but explosive swing, combining bat speed with natural feel for the barrel to generate hard contact to all fields, with easy, plus raw power to his pull side. He can handle velocity fine and has a knack for punishing mistakes, though an aggressive approach does make him vulnerable to quality secondary offerings.

Hays spent much of 2017 in center field before reaching the Majors, where he logged more time in right (14 games) than center (eight). His speed and range, both slightly above average, make him a quality defender at both positions, while his accurate, plus arm is a natural fit in right.

Full Report:  Stewart got headlines over the summer for his historic curveball spin rates that regularly were in the elite 3000+ rpm range, notable even for big leaguers. Entering the year, Stewart was a lanky projection arm that sat 88-92 mph and, if his velocity jumped into the mid-90's like scouts were predicting, he'd move into the first half of round one. That's exactly what happened. Stewart came out of the gates strong and in the middle of the spring was regularly sitting 92-96, hitting 98 mph and flashing a 70 curveball, as well as other starter traits. His finish to the spring was rough as he dealt with a minor injury and he had a couple starts where he topped at 94 mph after sitting there weeks before. Some scouts don't like his on-mound demeanor. Stewart still offers perhaps arguably the highest upside among the prep arms and didn't really have any blemishes on his resume until the last month, so she should still go in the top 10-12 picks, unless clubs are out on prep arms altogether due to preceived risk.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 65 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55  Stewart jumped on the radar with a strong summer showcase circuit showing at a number of events. When he came out this spring even better, with more velocity, he made a huge leap to near the top of many Draft boards.  With a projectable 6-foot-6 frame, there was always the thought that there might be more in Stewart's tank in the future. Evidently, the future is now. He has been as lights out as any prep arm in the country, coming out of the gate up to 98 mph and touching 96-97 mph in just about every start and easily sits 92-94 mph. He has one of the best breaking balls in the class, a power curve that is now a mid-80s hammer. While his changeup is behind right now, and he occasionally slows his arm down, he has feel for it and it should be a solid pitch in the future.  While some have expressed mild concern with a deep arm action in the back, Stewart has shown he can fill up the strike zone with two current plus pitches. The Mississippi State has moved into the top of the first round conversation, with some thinking he would be a candidate to go 1-1 if it weren't for the fact a high school right-hander has never been taken with the top pick.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VPPae4eCvXg?autoplay=1""","""|""","""MIN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""ATL""",8,,,,"""|""","""Eau Gallie HS FL""","""Mississippi State""","""Eau Gallie (Fla.)

He continued to move quickly in 2015, advancing to Double-A at age 19 and then turning in a strong showing as the Arizona Fall League's youngest player. Bauers built on that success in his return to the Southern League in 2016, establishing career highs in most offensive categories, and he was solid yet again in '17 as one of the Triple-A International League's youngest players.  Bauers has a knack for barreling the ball from the left side of the plate, with a compact, clean swing that fuels his use of the whole field. He's begun to hit the ball in the air with greater consistency in the last two seasons, and more power could be on the way as he develops physically and becomes more comfortable turning on the ball. Bauers' advanced approach and feel for working counts drive his on-base skills, as he paced the International League in walks (78) after ranking second in Southern League in 2016.   Defensively, Bauers spent much of 2017 in Durham's outfield before returning to first base, his natural position, in August. He's considerably better at first, where he's athletic and smooth around the bag with a slick glove, although his lack of power does complicate his offensive profile.

There are better fastballs among the deep high school pitching crop in this Draft class, but Liberatore's pitchability is what separates him. That's not to say he doesn't have good stuff, because he has the potential to eventually develop three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, maintaining the velocity throughout his starts, and he opened some eyes by touching 96-97 mph frequently in the early stages of the spring. He's also made mechanical changes to vastly improve his command of the pitch. He throws a slower curveball with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate and introduced a new, and very effective, slider this spring. And his changeup gives him a third secondary pitch that could be plus when all is said and done.

He has moved quickly, beginning 2017 by batting .357 in the World Baseball Classic for Mexico and ending it in Los Angeles, where he hit his first big league homer off Adam Ottavino. In between, he batted .314 as the youngest regular (age 21) in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, where he was just one of two regulars with more walks (52) than strikeouts (50).    One of the best pure hitting prospects in baseball, Verdugo recognizes pitches and controls the strike zone better than most players his age. He uses the whole field, repeatedly barreling balls with a quick left-handed stroke geared for line drives. Though he homered just seven times in 132 games last season, his hitting ability, bat speed and strength should translate into average power if he adds some loft to his swing.    As good as he is in the batter's box, Verdugo's best tool actually is his plus-plus arm. Despite average speed, he has spent much of his pro career in center field, where his instincts help him get the job done. Scouts are split on whether he can handle center on a daily basis in the Majors, but no one doubts that his arm would play in right.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mRH_od9cYyw?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""TEX""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2014""","""Sahuaro HS (AZ)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""LAD""","""lad""","""LA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",50,40,55,45,50,60,60,50,55,40,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,50,50,70,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He blossomed into a potential five-tool player in the subsequent years, ultimately earning his first big league callup in June 2017 after an impressive Triple-A campaign. But a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee, suffered when he ran into the wall down the right-field line in his Major League debut, required immediate surgery and prematurely ended Fowler's season. Nearly a month later, he was dealt to the A's with James Kaprielian and Jorge Mateo at the Trade Deadline for right-hander Sonny Gray.    Fowler has grown as a hitter in each of his five seasons. Employing a short-but-impactful swing, he makes lots of hard contact, driving the ball across the entire field. Fowler generates good pop for his size and could produce 15 to 20 home runs at the highest level, while his plus speed nets him plenty of doubles and triples and gives him impact potential on the basepaths. Fowler doesn't have much swing-and-miss to his game, though he does stand to benefit from more selectivity in his approach.    Fowler's outfield defense improved considerably during his time with the Yankees, thanks in part to his work with outfield instructor Reggie Willits. It's led to more playing time in center field, where he profiles as at least an above-average defender, since the start of 2016. While the impact of his knee injury has yet to be seen, Fowler's across-the-board tools and strong track record of performance points to him becoming an everyday player, if not more.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/FLb3S3KNFvk?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""BAL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""18th rd 2013""","""West Laurens HS (GA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""OAK""","""oak""","""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",50,40,55,60,45,45,55,50,55,60,50,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,60,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

While McCann helped Houston win the 2017 World Series, New York has no complaints with the deal, because Abreu shows the upside of a frontline starter and Guzman became the headline prospect in the Giancarlo Stanton trade with the Marlins. Signed for $185,000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2013, Abreu pitched just 53 1/3 innings last summer while dealing with a shoulder strain, but was one of the more impressive arms in the Arizona Fall League. Abreu's start to the 2018 season was delayed as he recovers from an appendectomy he underwent in February.   When Abreu is at his best, he exhibits command of three pitches that all grade as plus or better. His fastball usually runs from 93-98 mph, tops out in the triple digits and features sink and run that generate both swings and misses as well as weak ground-ball contact. His power breaking ball looks like a curveball at times and a slider at others, more often the former, and he also can miss bats with his fading changeup.  Abreu has a bit of a short-arm delivery that adds deception, making him all the more difficult to hit. His walk rate dropped from 4.5 per nine innings in three years in the Astros system to 3.0 in his first with the Yankees, quieting talk that he might be destined for the bullpen.

Hansen's fastball sits at 94-97 mph early in games and tops out at 99, and its running life and the downhill plane he generates with his 6-foot-7 frame make it all the more difficult to hit. He owns a pair of power breaking balls, a curveball with 12-to-6 break and a slider with late tilt, and the curve has been more effective since he turned pro. He'll flash an average changeup at times, but it still needs more work.  The concerns that dogged Hansen in the Draft still exist to some extent. There's effort in his delivery, which costs him not only control and command, but also some velocity in the late innings. He has cut his walk rate from 6.0 per nine innings in college to 3.3 in his first two years as a pro, though some evaluators still think he's destined for the bullpen rather than the rotation.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VQzZu_90hZk?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2016""","""Oklahoma""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CHW""","""chw""","""CWS""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,40,60,45,,,,40,60,45,60,50,,,,45,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,50,60,55,,,,45

After signing for $1,327,600 as a 2013 second-rounder, McMahon cruised through the lower Minors before batting .242 with 161 strikeouts in Double-A in 2016. He righted himself last year, finishing second in the Minors in hitting (.355) and making his big league debut in August.    McMahon's left-handed swing got too long and too uphill in 2016, but he fixed it last year and recorded the best numbers of his career. He cut his strikeout rate to 18 percent, down from 27 percent in his first four pro seasons, and he let the natural loft in his stroke produce power instead of selling out for home runs. He should hit for average and power while benefiting from Coors Field, though he doesn't draw many walks.    McMahon has solid arm strength and spent the first three years of his pro career at third base, but he was erratic there and wasn't going to dislodge Nolan Arenado from the hot corner in Colorado. He saw most of his action at first base in 2016-17 and began playing second base last year. The Rockies liked his initial results at second, though scouts outside the organization question whether he has the quickness to play there regularly.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aWNFMcDTPS8?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""LAA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2013""","""Mater Dei HS (CA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""COL""","""col""","""COL""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,50,60,30,40,55,45,60,60,30,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,55,40,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

His move to the upper levels of the system in 2017 was largely a successful one, including a Futures Game invite and Southern League All-Star nod, though he did struggle in the second half of the season.  Gordon is the type of player who may not jump off the page with any one tool, but does a number of things well. He's typically employed a successful contact-oriented, line-drive approach from the left side of the plate. He did show more extra-base power in Double-A, but with that came a higher strikeout rate, though an increased walk rate offset that to a degree. He's a solid runner with good instincts and will steal a base on occasion, and is a tick above-average defensively, both in terms of his arm and overall actions at shortstop. Many have felt his range points to being a better fit at second base and while he did still primarily play short, he did see more time on the right side of the infield in 2017.  Gordon will be 22 for all of the 2018 season and is knocking on the big league door. He's more of a high floor than ceiling type and isn't far away from showing just what kind of solid everyday big leaguer he can be, on either side of second base.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bXiuMCdQJP4?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""HOU""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2014""","""Olympia HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIN""","""min""","""MIN""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,30,55,50,45,60,50,45,55,50,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,40,50,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

When MLB discovered the discrepancy, it barred him from signing for one year and he landed with the Yankees in March 2015 after producing a Haitian birth certificate with a slightly different birthdate. His $200,000 bonus -- a fraction of what he would have commanded without the controversy -- looks like a bargain because he has the best all-around tools in New York's deep system and earned a spot in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game while making his full-season debut in 2017.  Florial has three tools that grade as well above average in his raw power, speed and arm strength. With the quickness and loft in his left-handed stroke, he's built to do a lot of damage at Yankee Stadium. The only question he has to answer is whether he can tone down his aggressive approach and make consistent contact after posting a 31 percent strikeout rate last season and a 36 percent mark in the Arizona Fall League. He lost some needed at-bats and development time when he had surgery on his right hamate in mid-May, a procedure that could keep him out until August.  While his swing-and-miss issues mean there's a wide gap between his ceiling and floor, Florial doesn't have to hit for high average to help a team win. He's as raw on the bases as he is at the plate, but his double-plus speed could make him a 30-30 player if he adds the necessary polish. While he's still learning in center field as well, he should be able to stick there and his arm is a weapon anywhere in the outfield.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mYK2ssfvC80?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""SF""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2014""","""Haiti""","""March 19, 2015 - NYY""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""NYY""","""nyy""","""NYY""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,30,60,60,40,60,40,55,60,60,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,70,65,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The Padres, after seeing him throw several bullpen sessions at Petco Park ahead of the Draft, ended up using their first of five Day 1 picks on Quantrill, selecting him eighth overall and then signing him for above slot value at $3,963,045. The Ontario native pitched at three levels, including the Class A Midwest League, during his pro debut and then reached Double-A in his first full season, after which he suited up for the World Team in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game.  Quantrill's deep arsenal features a pair of plus-or-better offerings in a 92-95 mph fastball that can reach 97, and a low-80s changeup that's among the best in the Minors. His slider at times can be inconsistent but still projects as an above-average offering, and he made strides in advancing his curveball in his first full season. Quantrill has feel for locating each of his pitches, particularly his fastball-changeup combo, and scouts expect him to miss more bats once his breaking balls improve.   A healthy first full season in which Quantrill logged 116 innings and maintained his velocity deep into games helped lay to rest any lingering concerns about his health. While the Padres will likely manage his workload once again in 2018, it shouldn't stop Quantrill, with his impressive blend of size, stuff and pitchability, from continuing his quick rise through the Minor Leagues.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/xNKf2IgKKqY?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Stanford""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SDP""","""sd""","""SD""","""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,55,45,40,,,,40,50,60,50,45,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,65,50,50,,,,55

Groome made three short starts in his debut before a lat strain and forearm soreness limited him to 55 1/3 innings in 2017, and he won't pitch at all this year after having Tommy John surgery in May.  Groome has spent most of his pro career working in the low 90s with armside run on his fastball, though he hit 97 mph as an amateur and should add more consistent velocity as he gets stronger and healthier. Even if his heater climbs into the mid-90s, it will take a back seat to a curveball with power and depth that was the consensus best breaking ball in his Draft class. He has some feel for a changeup that flashes some sink, but it lacks consistency because he hasn't had much experience throwing it yet.  Though Groome averaged 4.9 walks per nine innings in his first two seasons as a pro, his athleticism and clean delivery bode well for his ability to provide more strikes in the future.

Unfortunately for both Espinoza and the Padres, the right-hander's 2017 season was over before it began, as he opened the year on the disabled list with right forearm tightness before undergoing Tommy John surgery in August.  Though he may be small in stature, there's nothing diminutive about Espinoza's stuff when healthy. His smooth delivery and lightning-quick arm produce a heater that can touch triple digits, though he typically works in the 94-97 mph range with late movement. Espinoza's curveball shows plus potential but lacked consistency at times in 2016, while his changeup, thrown with fastball-like arm action as well as considerable sink, gives the teenager a true chance for three plus pitches once he matures. Beyond the stuff, Espinoza repeats his mechanics well and demonstrates advanced control and command for a hurler his age.

The performance, along with a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May, during which he hit 102 mph, gave the right-hander some serious helium ahead of the 2017 Draft. The Blue Jays ended up selecting Pearson 28th overall with the second of their two first-round picks, then signed him for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900. Pearson continued to thrive in his pro debut, turning in a lights-out performance with Class A Short Season Vancouver after a brief stop in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.  Pearson's four-pitch mix is highlighted by the best fastball and slider in Toronto's system. He was consistently up to 97-98 mph with his fastball during the spring and threw even harder in his pro debut, at times bumping triple digits, albeit in shorter stints. Pearson has already cleaned up his slider since signing and now throws it with more power and tilt in the upper 80s, giving him a legitimate put-away pitch to complement his explosive fastball. His changeup is currently ahead of his curveball, with the former grading out as an average pitch and the curve being more fringy.   There's some concern regarding Pearson's durability because he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school, but the 6-foot-6 hurler was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college and during his debut. Provided he stays healthy, Pearson seems well on his way toward becoming a No. 3 starter, perhaps more if he can improve his secondaries and overall command.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/t_D8-uewjYw?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CLE""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2017""","""Central Florida JC""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""","""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",65,50,,50,,,,35,70,55,,55,,,,45,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,50,45,55,,,,45

Since then, the only thing that's slowed him from developing into one of the better lefty prospects in the game was a minor shoulder issue that delayed the start to his 2017 season in Double-A, though he still pitched well enough to reach Triple-A for the first time.  The 6-foot-5 southpaw uses a combination of pitchability and deception that allows his largely solid-average stuff to play up and miss bats consistently. He'll largely pitch with his fastball in the low 90s, with the ability to reach for an extra tick or two on occasion, thrown with good riding life. His changeup remains his best secondary pitch, one he throws with good sink and effectively keeps down in the zone.

There has never been any question about Riley's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts, he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in 2017 while moving up the ladder.

Full Report:  Because of the local weather, high school baseball in Wisconsin doesn't get underway until late May, which would have made Kelenic impossible to scout were there not alternatives. Kelenic ended up on a youth travel team called Hitters Baseball which played lots of weekend games at any of three facilities near Kenosha and in Cedar Rapids. The concentration of opposing talent in these games was sufficient enough that teams thought Kelenic reinforced what they saw from him as an underclassman. He's a selective hitter with all-fields doubles power and a chance to stay in center field.Kelenic is almost 19 and already quite physically mature, each considered negatives by the scouting community, but he comes with a long track record most prep hitters do not. Opinions vary regarding Kelenic's physical projection and how it might affect his power output and ultimate defensive home, but Kelenic's bat is stable enough that he's one of the higher-floor high school prospects. With few college hitters in the mid-first round mix, Kelenic could be considered a viable, slightly toolsier alternative to college hitting as early as pick #6.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55  Kelenic has the tools and track record to become the first Wisconsin product ever selected in the top 10 picks, and at the very least should become just the seventh Badger Stater ever plucked in the first round.

Committed to Louisville, he'll be Draft-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2020 in the unlikely event he makes it to college rather than turning pro.  Compared to a more athletic version of Mark Kotsay, Kelenic stands out most for his hitting ability. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and repeatedly demonstrates a professional approach from the left side of the plate. With his solid raw power and speed, he can contribute offensively in a variety of ways.  Scouts aren't sold that Kelenic can stay in center field all the way up to the big leagues, but his quickness and instincts give him a chance. If he has to move to a corner, he has more than enough arm strength to handle right field.

Full Report:  Bart was a known high school prospect in the Atlanta suburbs and, though a few teams nearly met it, his price tag pushed him to Tech where he's grown into one of this draft's top talents. He has elite feel for the position, projecting as an impact defender with a 65-grade arm despite being bigger than most good defensive ctachers. He also does advance work for every game, calls area scouts for gameplan input, and is possibly the only catcher at a major program that calls his own games. Scouts rave about his makeup.Offensively, Bart has huge power and has hit some tape measure shots, including a ball that went over the football facility roof in left field at Georgia Tech and still hasnt been found. He isnt the most selective hitter and doesnt have the loosest swing in the class, but he has some feel for the bat head and doesnt have trouble with velocity. His power and fly-ball based approach along with these issues mean he could be a 40 or 45 bat with about an average walk rate and anywhere from 50 to 60 game power. Some of his strikeouts this year were a result of getting pitched around. He's seen a lot of off-speed pitches and has altered his approach to hit what he was facing, which likely wont be a big issue in pro ball.Since Bart is so advanced defensively, some scouts have speculated that hell go straight to High-A and could debut in the big leagues in late 2019. This could make him one of those prospects that gets to the big leagues before the holes to his offensive game have been closed because he's so good at everything else. The Giants have been all over Bart all spring and are expected to take him 2nd overall, but he's also a candidate to go 1st if Mize's medical or bonus demands become problematic.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 30 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55  Bart's power potential could have gotten him selected in the first five rounds of the Draft after he led Buford High to the 2015 Georgia 4-A state championship, but he dropped to the Rays in the 27th round because he was committed to Georgia Tech. His development at the plate and improvement behind it has him positioned as the top college catcher available in 2018. The Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year and defensive player of the year, he's poised to join Jason Varitek and Matt Wieters as Yellow Jackets backstops popped in the first round, and he's even been linked to the Giants as a possible No. 2 overall pick.Bart's bat speed, strength and leverage give him power to all fields from the right side of the plate. He has the swing and the feel to hit for a solid average, and he has made huge strides with his plate discipline this spring. He has enough natural pop that he doesn't need to sell out for home runs, and he's not falling into that trap as much as he did in the past.  There were questions about Bart's long-term catching ability when he arrived at Georgia Tech, but he has cleaned up his receiving enough that there no longer are doubts that he'll stay behind the plate. His strong arm never has been in question and he threw out 40 percent of basestealers in his first two college seasons.

Working with pitching coach Jason Dietrich at Oregon, Peterson struck out better than 12.5 per nine and walked just 1.35 per nine as a junior and brings a solid repertoire and that plus control to the pro game. From a velocity standpoint, Peterson's fastball is average, sitting in the low 90s and occasionally touching 95 mpg. But it plays up thanks to its plus sink and his ability to command it.

He makes consistent contact and shows decent patience from the left side of the plate, so he should hit for a solid average.

India arrived on campus a fringy defensive shortstop, became a generic defender at third and slightly above-average college hitter. But that all changed this year. India got in better shape and his tools improved as well: he now has 55 raw power and is an above average defensive third baseman that could play a passable middle infield. In addition to the tool and body composition improvements, India made some subtle adjustments to his approach at the plate and they paid off in a big way, with gaudy power numbers.

After two fairly pedestrian years with the Gators, along with a pair of summers in the Cape Cod League, the infielder has broken out in a big way during his junior season.  India has been perhaps the best all-around college hitter this spring, showing the ability to impact the game in a number of ways. He has an advanced approach at the plate, showing excellent plate discipline and the ability to hit for average that should translate. His pitch selection has improved tremendously, which in turn has given him better pitches to drive, something he's doing more consistently this year, with some evaluators seeing at least average power from him in the future. He's a solid runner with excellent instincts and can steal a base. India has played a lot of third, but his athleticism and instincts, not to mention his strong arm, could allow him to play any of a number of infield positions at the next level.

Although a grim ankle injury prematurely ended his first full season and a broken hamate limited him the following year, a fully healthy Harrison blossomed in 2017, earning Midwest League All-Star honors before advancing to the Carolina League. He finished the season with 21 home runs and 27 stolen bases over 122 games between the two levels, and then firmly put himself on the Major League radar with a standout campaign in the Arizona Fall League. Harrison's breakout caught the attention of the Marlins, and they acquired him with Lewis Brinson, Isan Diaz and Jordan Yamamoto for Christian Yelich in January.  Lewis Brinson might have the loudest tools in Miami's system, but Harrison isn't far behind. He generates plus raw power to all fields thanks to a combination of physical strength and plus bat speed that enables him to turn around velocity. His swing can get long at times, leading to some swing-and-miss issues, and he'll chase breaking balls in the dirt, but the overall approach is solid, giving him a nice foundation as a hitter. Harrison's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender, either in center field or in right, where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit.  Harrison offered a taste of his potential during his breakout 2017 campaign, and the Marlins are justifiably excited about what the future may hold for their new outfielder. If he can stay healthy, Harrison could develop into a perennial 20/20 player who also offers considerable value with his defense.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/RRzOrr9b4V8?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""NYA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2014""","""Lee's Summit West HS (MO)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIA""","""mia""","""MIA""","""|""",1,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,30,60,60,45,80,45,55,60,60,50,80,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,60,70,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Bohm has a strong, wiry frame and, though it may take a swing tweak to unlock it's full potential in games, he has among the best raw power and power projection in the entire draft. His swing is too contact-oriented. Many college programs emphsize contact-oriented swings because college defenses are bad and the bats allow you to hit for power anyway. Bohm would likely benefit, long-term, from a swing that better loads his hands to take advantage of his strength and that lets him extend his arms more. This would likely cost him some contact ability, but he has a 9% K rate this year due in part to surprising feel to hit, so there's lots of room for more whiffs before they become an issue.While currently athletic enough to stay at third, Bohm's broad frame is likely to add some weight over the next few years, and he may have to move down the defensive spectrum. This, plus an projected swing change, mean more of Bohm's profile exists in abstraction than is typical for this kind of college performer. The Phillies zeroed in on Bohm early in the spring and are the favorites to select him.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 55 | Run: 35 | Arm: 50 | Field: 45 | Overall: 55  Coming into 2018, scouts were divided as to which of Wichita State's two potential first-round position players was better. Greyson Jenista has more all-around ability and won the Cape Cod League MVP award last summer, but Bohm posted better numbers there and does a better job of tapping into his considerable power potential. Bohm easily settled the argument with a superior junior season, thrusting himself into consideration as a top-five-overall pick.Bohm manages the strike zone very well and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't strike out as much as Jenista, has an edge in bat speed and his stroke is more geared to generate power at this point. He understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs, so he doesn't.  Bohm doesn't offer much when he's outside of the batter's box, however. Though he has worked diligently to improve at third base, he lacks quickness and range, his hands are just fair and his arm is only average.

His changeup should be an average pitch and the more he can throw it effectively, the better weapon it will be against left-handed hitters. While he's not a command artist, he'll throw enough strikes to be a successful starter.  The key for Romero now is to continue to build strength and show durability throughout a season.

The Angels loved his upside and athleticism enough to take him in the second round of the 2016 Draft, but they had to wait to see him play until 2017 as a back issue was found in his post-Draft physical. The wait was worth it, as he was one of the more exciting players in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.    Despite having split his focus among two sports in high school, missing his summer debut and then being out for a short spell with a thumb injury in 2017, Marsh has a very good feel to hit and the Angels feel he could be at least an above-average hitter in time. He makes consistent hard contact, recognizes pitches well and should grow into at least average power. A plus runner who can steal a base, Marsh has more than enough speed to play center field and a plus arm that would fit perfectly well in right.    The Angels are excited to see what Marsh can do over the course of a full, healthy season as he continues to grow into his athletic frame.

Borucki has a low-90s fastball that peaks at 95, with late movement that helps him generate ground balls. His plus changeup is the best in the system and plays nicely off his heater because he throws it with similar arm speed, in turn giving him a chance against right-handed hitters. Borucki's slider is less advanced than his changeup, with varying shape and pace, but it has the potential to be another Major League-average pitch. Despite missing parts of three seasons due to injury, Borucki has never lost his feel for pounding the zone with his entire arsenal, and he'll enter 2018 having issued just 2.2 walks-per-nine in his career.

Patience will be key for Baz, and the Pirates know a thing or two about developing young pitching. With room to add strength to his athletic frame, Baz could slowly move up the right-handed pitching prospect ranks as he settles in to his pro career.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vjv8crlG4_o?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""SF""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2017""","""Concordia Lutheran HS (TX)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""PIT""","""pit""","""PIT""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,40,50,,45,,,30,60,50,60,,60,,,45,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",65,50,55,60,60,,,50

He should move quickly and be in a big league rotation. His upside is a #3/4 starter.    Full Report:  Singer was a well-regarded prospect in high school who got results with an unusual delivery and low arm slot. The Blue Jays took him in the 2nd round. Negotiations broke down and Singer went to Florida where he was a standout from day one. There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: his stuff still isn't loud, he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters, his delivery turns off some scouts and his breaking ball is often fringy. Even scouts that like Singer think he has limited upside, but you can't argue with the results he has gotten in the SEC for several years and with his long track record of health. He has feel for pitching and a bulldog mentality, performing at the highest levels of amateur baseball. There's interest in Singer at multiple picks in the top 5, with Cincinnati at 5 the most rumored spot. He should move quickly and could be in a big league rotation in 2019.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 55    Singer has been able to pitch with such top college talent like A.J. Puk, the No. 6 overall pick in 2016, and Alex Faedo, who went No. 18 last June, at the University of Florida. After playing a pivotal role in helping the Gators win a national title, and pitching better than Faedo in many ways, it's now Singer's turn to be the Florida ace. At first it seemed like Singer would have the chance to be the No. 1 overall pick in the Draft, but a slow start to his junior season knocked him down a peg.    Singer checks off all of the boxes teams are looking for out of a potential top pick. Long and lean, he has a terrific pitcher's body that has thus far proven to be durable. He'll throw his fastball up to 95-96 mph consistently, with plus life. His slider plays well off of his fastball, a second above-average pitch he manipulates in terms of depth and velocity. His changeup continues to improve and should give him a third above-average offering. He commands the ball well, gets high marks for his makeup and is a plus competitor.    Both Puk and Faedo entered into their Draft seasons as potential 1-1 selections, but they didn't perform quite well enough to go in that top spot, and in some ways Singer followed suit. His stuff was bouncing back as the Draft approached, so don't expect him to slide too far down boards.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/zr81CO4HyzY?autoplay=1""","""|""","""NYA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""KC""",18,,,,"""|""","""Florida""","""""","""Florida""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""","""""","""+""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",65,55,,60,,,,55

Always blessed with tremendous raw tools, the outfielder started using them more consistently, finishing with a 20-40 season that placed him first in the Midwest League in stolen bases and second in home runs. He kept his hot bat going with a very strong showing in the Dominican Winter League, but then started the 2018 season on the disabled list after suffering ligament damage in his left thumb.    When Siri makes contact, it's loud, and he has the ability to drive the ball, and out of the park, to all fields. His power showed up more consistently in 2017, but whether he'll be able to get to it as he moves up will be dependent on his ability to refine his approach. His strikeout-to-walk ratio needs a lot of work as his aggressiveness at the plate leads to a lot of swings and misses and few free passes. He's a plus runner and then some, one who will continue to steal bases and cover a ton of ground in the outfield. He certainly can play center field long term and his cannon arm plays very well in right.    Siri might always be one of those super-aggressive hitters who succeeds because of his ridiculous tools and athleticism. But the abilty to improve his approach at the plate could allow him to become an impact, All-Star caliber player.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/O-dXckzAobc?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CLE""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2012""","""Dominican Republic""","""Sept. 21, 2012 - CIN""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CIN""","""cin""","""CIN""","""|""",0,1,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,40,50,60,50,60,60,55,50,60,55,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,50,70,65,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

That's a big reason why Maitan was ranked No. 1 on MLB Pipeline's Top 30 international prospects list entering the 2016 July 2 signing period and why the Braves shelled out $4.25 million to sign him. Maitan was declared a free agent last November, however, as part of the penalty levied against the Braves for violation of baseball's rules on signing international amateur free agents. The Angels swooped in and signed Maitan for $2.2 million in December once he was eligible to join another organization.    The Venezuelan teenager had been compared to Miguel Sano and his ceiling has been put side-by-side with the likes of Miguel Cabrera and Chipper Jones, though a pedestrian pro debut in 2017 had cooled some evaluators' opinions of him. He has pop from both sides, with perhaps a touch more from the right side. While he's not a runner, he is agile and athletic in the field. He has a very strong arm and good instincts, and while most foresee a move to third in the future, he will continue to play shortstop for the Angels. There are some concerns regarding his conditioning, something he'll need to watch if he doesn't want to become a first base-only type, though he had shed some weight at instructs with the Braves last fall.    Wherever he plays defensively, Maitan has the combination of hitting tools and feel for the game to potentially develop into a future superstar in the middle of a lineup.

While he may not have as high a ceiling as former top Cubs infield prospects Javy Baez, Addison Russell and Gleyber Torres, he still offers plenty of upside and has a high floor.  Ademan is an advanced hitter who already recognizes pitches, uses the whole field and doesn't try to do too much. He makes repeated contact, drilling line drives to all fields while managing the strike zone well.

Control woes reappeared last season when the Dodgers promoted him aggressively, yet he was overpowering when he found the strike zone.    Few pitchers can match Alvarez's combination of athleticism and arm speed, which allows him to sit at 94-97 mph into the late innings and reach 101 mph with life on his fastball while exerting little effort. However, his heater can get hit hard when he can't locate it down in the strike zone. Similarly, his upper-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch but also can be ineffective when he can't get it over the plate.    Alvarez's struggled even more in 2017 with his changeup, which was too firm to throw hitters off balance. He also has messed around with a hard curveball, though refining his slider is a greater priority.

He'll frequently touch triple digits with his fastball and sits consistently in the 95-99 mph range with late movement.

He strained his elbow shortly after signing and Texas handled him with care, so he totaled just 181 2/3 innings during his first four pro seasons. He broke out in 2016, jumping from Class A Advanced to the big leagues, and received another September callup in 2017.  Mendez owns one of the best changeups in the Minors, with fade, sink and deception that add up to a well above-average pitch at its best. He relies on it almost too heavily at the expense of his other pitches, so the Rangers restricted his use of it last year so he could focus on the rest of his repertoire. He has good feel for his 90-95 mph sinker, but not as much for his pair of fringy breaking balls, with his slider more reliable than his curveball.  Though he's still not very physical, Mendez has proven his durability during the last two seasons. He doesn't have a huge margin for error, but does a good job of throwing strikes and working down in the zone.

After producing consistently at the plate while making year-to-year improvements throughout three seasons at Kentucky, White, a USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award semifinalist, joined Chad Green (Brewers, 1996) as the only Wildcats position players ever to get drafted in the first round.  White manages the strike zone well and usually focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap with a relatively flat swing. He has good bat speed and a long frame built to create leverage, so power should come once he adds more strength to his body and more loft to his swing. Meanwhile, the fact that he turned on more pitches last spring at Kentucky en route to a career-best 10 home runs -- he combined for seven homers during his freshman and sophomore seasons -- bodes very well for his future.  A plus runner with solid arm strength, White proved a very capable corner outfielder with the U.S. college national team in 2016.

Signed for $2,003,400 as the 30th overall pick in 2016, he topped the short-season Northwest League in strikeouts (87) last summer and easily would have led in strikeout rate (13.7 per nine innings) if he had enough innings to qualify. His encore will be delayed until 2019, however, because he was diagnosed with an elbow injury during Spring Training that required Tommy John surgery.  Ragans' fastball sits in the low 90s and peaks at 95 mph, but it plays as a plus pitch because it features a high spin rate that creates riding life and he also hides it well. He added some velocity during his first full year of pro ball and could pick up more as he continues to strengthen his lean frame. His changeup is similarly effective and his downer curveball should become a solid third pitch once it develops more power.  Ragans has sound mechanics and employs a high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. Though he's athletic and repeats his delivery, his control and command are still works in progress.

In his short time as a pro, Knizner has shown a knack for barreling up the baseball, making consistent hard contact to all fields. An aggressive hitter from the right side of the plate, he doesn't walk much, but he also doesn't strike out. His power will be the last tool to come for him, but he's already showing some over-the-fence pop.

He has solid average hands and he's continuing to learn the nuances of game-calling.    Knizner didn't disappoint in handling the challenge of the double-jump to Double-A while still learning his craft as a backstop, seriously upgrading his prospect profile.

Full Report:  Torres has some mid round one buzz as we approach the draft because, not ony does he throw hard and flash two promising secondaries, but he's also a fresh Northeastern arm and very young for the class. Torres only threw close to 40 innings this spring and his changeup is a welcome sight for bad suburban high school hitters in New York who can't catch his fastball, but it flashed 55 or 60 last summer and is easy to dream on.

Torres Jr. won't go as early as Anderson did, but also seeing him come off the board in the top two rounds seems very reasonable.     A standout for Beacon High School, Torres put his name more firmly on the national radar with strong showings at Perfect Game National, the Tournament of Stars and by pitching in the PG All-American Classic Game. He cemented his spot by coming out of the gate and showing similar arm strength this spring. The right-hander will sit around 93 mph right now and can touch 96-97 mph, and it's easy to dream on more velocity consistently in the future, especially given he's just 17 years old. Torres has a slider that could be a future plus pitch, though he doesn't always show it now, dominating his competition with his fastball. He'll also fiddle with a changeup in the bullpen that has some arm side run, but he doesn't use it in games.    Like with many young pitchers, he's more control over command right now, but he tends to throw strikes.

He had only sporadic success in his first three seasons after signing for $1,870,500 as the 26th overall pick, however, batting .235/.301/.396 with a 27 percent strikeout rate. Then a change in approach led to a breakout 2017, when he finished third in the Minors in extra-base hits (68) and fifth in homers (31) while reaching Double-A. Chavis began the 2018 season on Portland's DL after straining his oblique in February, then was slapped with an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.  The key for Chavis was understanding that he doesn't have to swing for the fences and that his bat speed, strength and loft in his right-handed swing will create plenty of natural power. He stopped trying to pull every pitch he saw out of the park and did a better job of recognizing pitches and adopting a two-strike approach. He cut his strikeout rate to 22 percent last year but still may not show enough patience to hit for a high average against quality pitching.  Chavis broke into pro ball as a shortstop before moving to third base in instructional league following his pro debut. While his below-average speed limits his range, he has a strong arm and has worked hard to become an acceptable defender at the hot corner.

It all led to Garrett becoming the highest-drafted Alabama prep since 1971 (Condredge Holloway, fourth overall) as Miami selected him with the seventh-overall pick in June and signed him away from a Vanderbilt commitment with an above-slot bonus. After having his pro debut pushed back until 2017, Garrett would make just four starts for Class A Greensboro before undergoing Tommy John surgery in June.    Garrett's curveball has drawn raves from scouts, many of whom considered it to be among the best in his Draft class. It's a true plus offering when Garrett is healthy, thrown at 76-80 mph with tight spin and great depth, and he demonstrates feel for moving it in and out of the zone as needed. Garrett creates good plane and pounds the zone with his 90-94 mph fastball, and it's easy to envision a bit more velocity in his future as he matures physically. His changeup, once fully developed, should serve as a third above-average-or-better offering, all of which stand to play up thanks to his advanced command.    Garrett started the year on the disabled list, but the Marlins are hopeful he will pitch in games sometime late in the 2018 season. However, any setback along the way has the potential to delay his return until the following year. Assuming he returns fully healthy, Garrett possesses a No. 2-starter ceiling, with a mature arsenal and strong command profile that also give him a relatively high floor.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/m1S8r6P_0gU?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""NYA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Florence HS (AL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIA""","""mia""","""MIA""","""|""",1,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,40,55,,,,,45,50,55,60,,,,,55,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",55,55,60,,,,,55

He made up for some of that lost time with a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League and then broke out in earnest in 2017, when he batted .323/.400/.484 across three levels including Triple-A. Fearing he might be taken in the Rule 5 Draft, Toronto added Jansen to its 40-man roster after the season.  That Jansen makes a lot of contact, understands the strike zone and recognizes pitches well highlights his upside as an offensive-oriented catcher who also adds value with his on-base kills. His combination of bat speed and physical strength yields sneaky power to his pull side, which is to where Jansen hit nine of his career-high 10 home runs in 2017. Behind the plate, Jansen has made impressive strides in his blocking, receiving and framing since signing, although his catch-and-throw skills may never be better than average.  Developing high school catchers tends to take time, and that's certainly been the case with Jansen. His solid tools on both sides of the ball, as well as his capacity to make adjustments, portends to a career as at least a big league backup if he can stay healthy.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/4lbMDzv8Er4?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""MIA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""16th rd 2013""","""West HS (WI)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""","""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",50,30,50,30,45,55,60,45,50,30,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,45,30,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He's proved to be that early in his career, showing a combination of pure hitting ability and power that earned him a promotion to Double-A at age 20 in 2017 before a successful turn in the Arizona Fall League. Mountcastle's 2018 debut was delayed by a fractured right hand.  Mountcastle boasts a quick bat and does an outstanding job of keeping his hands inside the ball so as to create extension through the zone and generate backspin to all fields. An advanced approach and good pitch recognition further fuel Mountcastle's projection as an above-average hitter, and scouts are equally high on his power potential after he piled up 67 extra-base hits, including 18 home runs and a Minor League-best 48 doubles, in his second full season.  The move up to Double-A brought a position change for Mountcastle as the Orioles shifted from shortstop to third base. He showed in the AFL that his below-average arm strength plays better at the hot corner than it did at short, though some scouts believe he'll ultimately end up further down the defensive spectrum. Regardless of his position, it will be Mountcastle's bat that helps him carve out a career as an impactful regular.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf-E2t1dIxo?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""COL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2015""","""Hagerty HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""BAL""","""bal""","""BAL""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,35,50,40,30,30,55,50,55,40,40,30,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,55,50,45,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

If sneaky plus-plus raw power exists, Larnach has it, as he generates it without taking max-effort hacks. There are teams that don't like Larnach in this range because they think he's a bad defender and/or they are concerned about his 20% strikeout rate, But Larnach's career 15% walk rate should help satiate the stat-driven people in draft rooms and his power numbers could take a jump if pro instruction coaxes more lift out of his swing.

With Nick Madrigal on the shelf for a good chunk of Oregon State's season, Larnach did just that. Following up a strong Cape Cod League season last summer, the outfielder has added power to his game to greatly raise his Draft profile.  Larnach has been known for his advanced approach from the left side of the plate since stepping into the Beavers' starting lineup as a sophomore. He's not afraid to draw walks and makes consistent hard contact, always loving using the opposite field. Evaluators have thought there was power to tap into and he's done that this spring, reaching double-digit home runs. With a tick above-average arm, there's a chance Larnach could play right, though a lack of speed makes most feel left field is his likely long-term defensive home.  Regardless of which outfield corner he plays, it's looking more and more like Larnach's bat will fit the profile just fine.

Acevedo's fastball has been clocked as high as 103 mph, though he usually works from 93-97 mph as a starter, which is even tougher to hit because of the funkiness and angle his 6-foot-7 frame and low three-quarters arm slot create. That slot makes it tough for him to stay on top of his mid-80s slider, which may never be more than an average offering. He compensates with a plus changeup that he locates well and is effective against both left-handers and right-handers.  For an extra-large guy with a lot of velocity, Acevedo throws a surprising amount of strikes. His delivery isn't smooth and features effort, yet he somehow makes it work and finally proved he could hold up over a full season in 2017.

He'll sit around 93 mph and touch 95 regularly with good sink. He threw his slider too much in college, but it is a true out pitch that gets a lot of swings and misses.

While Weathers lacks a true out pitch, he has three solid offerings and mixes them well. His fastball sits at 90-93 mph and tops out at 95, playing above its velocity with a high spin rate that gives it deceptive riding life. His upper-70s curveball usually features good depth and he possesses an advanced changeup for a teenager.  Weathers has a sound delivery and repeats it well, throwing strikes with ease. He's a good athlete who does the little things well and could contribute as a two-way player at Vanderbilt if he doesn't turn pro.

After a strong summer debut, Hayes was limited by a fractured rib during his full-season debut in 2016. A move to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in 2017 at age 20 didn't faze him at all.  Hayes continues to refine his advanced approach as he moves up the ladder, gaining strength and adding speed as he goes. In 2017, his walk rate went up and his strikeout rate went down as his contact-oriented philosophy worked for him. He can drive the ball to all fields and while there wasn't much power in the pitching-friendly FSL, scouts feel it will come as he continues to mature. As Hayes has gotten into better shape, he's become a much better baserunner, finishing among the league leaders in stolen bases in 2017. He's always been a gifted defender, but the added agility has led to more range and made him even stronger at the hot corner.  The upper levels of the Pirates' system should provide a good challenge for Hayes, who will play all of 2018 at age 21.

Full Report:  Hankins was the consensus top prep arm in the class this summer, dominating hitters and peaking with Team USA in the fall. At that point, Hankins was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater, a new, but already plus slider and at least and average changeup that he didn't need much. He came out of the gates this spring a little rusty then walked off the mound with shoulder tightness tied to a muscle behind the joint. He returned over a month later and has been good down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games this spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for the pitch anymore.The curveball that replaced it is similar to Brady Singer's curveball and is often a 45 or 50, maybe a 55 once a start but not often enough to project it as such. He's healthy, teams are clearing his medical and the arm speed is back, but his frame is now maxed-out and it's unclear where his breaking ball went and if it will come back. He's seen as very signable and the team that takes him will be banking on him returning to form; we've assumed there's a little more slider feel that will be teased out but not the 60 pitch of the summer.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 80 | Curveball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 55 | Overall: 50  Hankins made himself a candidate to become the first high school right-hander to go No. 1 overall in the Draft with an outstanding summer on the showcase circuit, finishing by striking out 27 in a pair of six-inning starts to help Team USA win the 18-and-under World Cup. He hasn't been the same pitcher this spring, however, leaving a mid-February start early due to shoulder tightness, an issue that was determined to be muscular but affected his stuff when he returned after a month-long layoff. He has become a total wild card as to where he fits in the Draft, and teams have to gauge his signability because he's part of a loaded Vanderbilt recruiting class that also includes fellow Georgia standouts Kumar Rocker and Will Banfield.  When he's 100 percent, Hankins has the best fastball in the 2018 Draft, sitting at 92-96 mph and reaching 98 mph with the promise of more velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-6 frame. Radar-gun readings alone don't make his heater special, as it also has electric life and he can spot it to both sides of the plate, and he could dominate amateur hitters while relying almost entirely on his fastball if he wanted. But there also have been times this spring where his fastball has parked around 90 mph with less movement than usual.  Hankins also has a fading changeup that has the makings of a plus pitch, though he'll need to come up with a reliable breaking pitch to become a front-of-the-rotation starter. His hard curveball showed improvement during the summer and he also began trying a slider, though neither has been very impressive this spring. He repeats his low-effort delivery well and will vary its tempo, at times adding a Johnny Cueto-esque shimmy to add deception.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/LrEeDHttijE?autoplay=1""","""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""CLE""",35,,,,"""|""","""Forsyth Central HS GA""","""Vanderbilt""","""Forsyth Central (Ga.)

Along with mental lapses and low energy, scouts are unsure how to project him.    Full Report:  As an underclassman, Turang looked like he might be the best prospect on a Southern California Area Code team that included Hunter Greene, Nick Allen, Jeremiah Estrada, Hans Crouse and several other excellent prospects. His balletic actions at shortstop and plus arm and athleticism gave Turang a stable floor, while his precocious feel to hit (he struck out just twice as a junior) and chance to grow into power made him a potential star. Turang looked like the best player in the class until last summer when he suddenly looked lethargic and uncomfortable at the plate. He's been better this spring, but not so great that concerns about his developmental direction have been quelled. Teams who value several years of performance are likely to value Turang more highly, and he should be off the board anywhere between the mid-teens and early twenties.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50    Turang entered last summer as perhaps the top player in the entire class, and certainly among the high school set. A combination of a relatively pedestrian summer showcase performances and an extremely high expectation bar, a trend that has continued this spring, caused his star to fade, though he's still one of the better prep players in the nation.    Turang does everything fairly well, though a lack of a true plus carrying tool is one reason why scouts were a bit down on him. Most feel he has the chance to be a plus hitter with an advanced approach at the plate using a high-contact, line-drive spray kind of approach. With a lean frame, there is some question about how much strength he'll add, with believers thinking power will come. Most feel he is a long-term shortstop, though some don't see it as a slam dunk.     Some feel Turang suffered more from being seen for so long that he was bound to get knocked simply for not being the best player on the field at all times. Others haven't seen him dominate the way they feel a top-of-the-Draft prospect should in high school. He is committed to LSU, which could become an issue depending on when he's selected.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ImTzgRayiHA?autoplay=1""","""|""","""OAK""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""MIL""",21,,,,"""|""","""Santiago HS CA""","""LSU""","""Santiago (Calif.)

Fedde continued to climb the ladder in 2017 en route to making his big league debut in July, though his season as a whole was inconsistent as the Nationals shuffled him between the starting rotation and bullpen.   The low-90s fastball with late life that Fedde shows as a starter plays up out of the bullpen, where he's capable of bumping the mid-90s with relative ease. His slider remains a plus offering, thrown in the low 80s with enough depth and tilt to consistently miss bats, and he completes his four-pitch mix with a below-average curveball and a changeup for which he demonstrated improved feel in 2017. Fedde also stands out for his pitchability, strike-throwing ability and knack for generating ground balls.   The Nationals' decision to shift Fedde to a relief role largely was a product of the club's ineffective big league bullpen.

Pegged as a likely top 10 Draft pick after strong start to his junior campaign, Romero was suspended for four starts in April for repeated violations of university and athletic department policy, returned in May for three relief appearances and got kicked off the team permanently. Those off-the-field issues didn't scare away the Nationals, who signed Romero for $2.8 million after taking him with the No. 25 overall pick.  A physically strong left-hander, Romero has feel for locating a fastball that can bump up to 97 mph and consistently sits 92-95. His plus slider in the low 80s is a legitimate swing-and-miss offering that nets him strikeouts on both sides of the plate, while Romero's changeup, much improved in 2017, has the makings of becoming an above-average third offering. Romero will miss bats with all three pitches when he's on, all while showing average control and command.   That Romero has a thicker build as well as some effort to his delivery gives some evaluators pause in projecting him as a starter long term.

He also homered more than he struck out and finished sixth all-time on the Cavaliers' career home run list and second on their RBI list.

Smith is limited to first base because of his below-average speed, but he's a capable defender with a solid arm there.

Meanwhile, a clean and repeatable delivery has helped to make Ortiz an accomplished strike-thrower early in his career, though some evaluators would like to see him spend less time in the zone   That Ortiz lacks projection to his mature, 6-foot-3 frame means that he will need to remain aggressive in his conditioning -- something he has done so far.

High in 2013, Lewis nearly captured the Southern Conference Triple Crown as a Mercer sophomore before starring in the prestigious Cape Cod League. He built on that success in 2016, garnering his second straight SoCon player of the year award as well as the prestigious Golden Spikes Award after batting a robust .395/.535/.731 with 20 home runs. The Mariners took Lewis with the 11th overall pick that June, and he signed for slot value at $3,286,700 two days later. Unfortunately, surgery to repair a torn ACL (as well as the medial and lateral meniscuses) in Lewis' right knee, an injury that he suffered during a home-plate collision prematurely ended his pro debut and then delayed the start of his 2017 campaign until June. When he finally returned to the field, Lewis aggravated his knee while making a catch against the outfield wall, an injury that resulted in another trip to the disabled list and continued to bother him during the Arizona Fall League. He had his right knee scoped in February to address lingering pain and began the year in extended spring training as he works back from the injury.  When healthy, Lewis shows the makings of becoming a dynamic offensive talent capable of hitting for both average and power. Big and physical, he possesses easy plus power to all fields from the right side of the plate, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. The approach is solid, though, and he controls the strike zone well while showing feel for hitting to all fields. Lewis isn't a burner but shows average speed underway, and he compensates for a lack of range in the outfield with excellent instincts and jumps.  The long-term impact that Lewis' knee injury has on his speed has yet to be seen and could ultimately force him to right field, where his plus arm and power potential are both clean fits. Lewis may be slightly behind the developmental curve, but he has the tools, aptitude and makeup to quickly make up for lost time.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nwMhSV87AD0?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""WAS""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Mercer""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SEA""","""sea""","""SEA""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,40,55,45,45,60,50,55,60,40,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,60,50,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Relief risk, has had a TJ.    Full Report:  McClanahan was in the mid-80's most of his high school career before, just before the draft, a velo bump into the low 90's put him on scouts' radars. He opted not to sign, then had another velo bump early at USF that eventually led to Tommy John surgery. Scouts were buzzing in the fall and just before the spring, seeing McClanahan up to 100 mph with two above average offspeed pitches, but still questioned if he was a starter or reliever. In his first start of the year, McClanahan dominated North Carolina and the consensus is that he would go in the top 5 picks. Things slowly unraveled from there, missing some starts with an illness or a cut on his finger from cutting a slice of bread, showing well below-average command and inconsistent off-speed pitches in other outings. Last week at the conference tournament in front of tons of heat and 2 GMs, McClanahan barely threw any changeups, many of his breaking balls were below average and his command was well below. There may be some teams that think a change of scenery and coaching may tease out those starter traits again, but most clubs (and us) think he's a reliever whose only consistent positive characteristic has been velocity.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 45 | Overall: 55  A late bloomer in high school, McClanahan opted for South Florida instead of the Mets, who had taken him in the 26th round in 2015. Tommy John surgery wiped out his freshman year, but he came back and pitched well as the Bulls' Saturday starter. He's kept it going as USF's ace this year, among the best in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings and being one of 40 named to USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List as a result, though his command regressed later in the spring.  McClanahan has as good of an arm as just about any college pitcher in the Draft, and the fact that it's his left one certainly doesn't hurt his Draft stock. He's touched triple digits this year with his fastball consistently all spring, hitting 97-100 on a regular basis. He combines that with a plus changeup, a pitch he throws with good arm speed that features a ton of late drop to it. His slider gives him a third at least average pitch.   While his strikeout rate has been really high, his walk rate has been as well. That, plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil, have some wondering if he's better suited for a bullpen, especially if that could get him to the big leagues in a hurry. With a loose and very athletic frame, though, McClanahan might be able to get away with those mechanics. He's elicited some Chris Sale comps, with some scouts thinking he has better stuff now, at least with the fastball, than Sale did in his Draft year.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ntk-CU1Bo6A?autoplay=1""","""|""","""SF""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""TB""",31,,,,"""|""","""USF""","""""","""South Florida""","""RS Sophomore""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,1,0,1,"""|""","""""","""""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,60,,50,,,,45

In a system that has no shortage of high-ceiling, position-playing prospects from the international ranks, it's Ornelas who might have the most upside. He offered a taste of his abilities in 2017 during his pro debut, slashing .276/.399/.408 with 17 extra-base hits and a 16.8 percent walk rate as a 17-year-old in the Rookie-level Arizona League.   Listed at 6-foot-4, 180 pounds, Ornelas shows the makings of becoming an impact player with his size, athleticism and array of tools. He's an advanced hitter with a fluid but explosive left-handed swing that produces line-to-line contact and big raw power. It could translate to above-average game power for Ornelas as he grows into his projectable frame and learns to hit the ball in the air more consistently. His patient approach, ability to recognize pitches and willingness to take a walk stand out for his age, and evaluators expect Ornelas to trim some of the swing-and-miss from his game as he gains experience.   Adding to Ornelas' allure is the fact that he spent much of his pro debut manning center field. However, he's unlikely to stay there, both because he's already a fringe-average runner and because he's expected to lose a step with physical development. That likely will push Ornelas to either right or left field, where his offensive profile and above-average arm strength are clean fits.""",,,,,"""|""","""CHA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2016""","""Mexico""","""July 2, 2016 - SD""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SDP""",,"""SD""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,20,55,50,40,50,55,55,60,45,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,55,45,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Already somewhat coveted for his offensive skills, Munoz has now played six positions in his Minor League career.  Primarily a shortstop for the first stages of his pro career, Munoz also saw time at second early on, then folded in some third base a little later on. In 2017, he added the outfield to his resume, playing all three spots. He has a plus arm, but won't wow anyone at any one spot with his glove work, though it looks like he's capable at any of them. At the plate, the right-handed hitter makes a lot of hard contact early in counts, He's super-aggressive and doesn't draw a ton of walks, but he also doesn't strike out a ton and has the chance to get to Major League average power in time.

He continued to excel in the Arizona Fall League, showing well on both sides of the ball against advanced competition.   Murphy draws raves from evaluators for his athleticism, agility and defensive tools behind the plate.

Many saw a future reliever as he came into pro ball, but after a first full season that saw him lead the system in ERA, there's no reason to think he can't start.    The word most often used to describe Wilson, a former high school football standout, is bulldog. He is fearless on the mound and looks like he should have a solid three-pitch mix to attack hitters with. He typically pitches with a 60 fastball, up to 95 mph, but it plays up at times because of the power sink to it that leads to a ton of ground-ball outs. His slider got slurvish at times last year and sometimes will look more like a curveball, but he's shown enough feel to spin a tighter slider and there is confidence that it will be an average, if not better, breaking ball. His changeup has improved and has a very good chance to be a third, at least Major League average, weapon.    Because of his build, his aggressive mentality on the mound, his fastball-slider combination and his delivery, many saw a backend bullpen piece.

The first catcher taken in the first round by the Dodgers since Paul Konerko in 1993, he has lived up to his reputation as being a better athlete and thrower than most backstops. His defense earned him a promotion to Double-A in the middle of his first full season, but an errant pitch broke his right hand in his first game at that level and sidelined him until the Arizona Fall League.    Smith's solid speed would allow him to beat most catchers in a race and helps him excel behind the plate. His good-not-great arm strength plays up because his feet are so quick and he threw out 48 percent of basestealers in 2017. His soft hands and agility are two more assets, and he's athletic enough to handle second and third base in short stints.    There's some question as to how much offense Smith will provide after he had just one big season at Louisville and batted .238/.357/.393 in his first two pro seasons. A right-handed hitter, he has seen his strikeout rate jump from 11 percent in college to 22 percent in pro ball as he tried to tap into his pull power.

His 2016 debut in the Dominican Summer League was somewhat pedestrian, but his combination of tools and feel for hitting during his United States debut in the Gulf Coast League in 2017 opened many eyes.  Sanchez has shown an advanced feel for the strike zone and ability to barrel up the baseball that belies his age. The teenager walked more than he struck out in the GCL and showed an ability to drive the ball to all fields. While he's not particularly big, his bat speed does help him generate more power than expected, with all of his over-the-fence pop coming to his pull side at present. He's at least a plus runner and should be a basestealing threat, especially as he learns more about reading pitchers. That speed also plays in center field, where he could be a plus defender long-term, with an above-average arm.  It's easy to get excited about Sanchez's tools and upside, but it's important to be patient and not pile too many expectations on him based on those projections.

Signed for an above-slot $997,500 in the third round, he easily handled low Class A at age 19 in his first full pro season and finished it with a strong start in the high Class A California League playoffs. He did his best pitching at the end, logging a 1.75 ERA and a 34/4 K/BB ratio in his final six outings.  May has taken well to a number of adjustments that the Dodgers have had him make. They had him shift from a four-seam fastball to a two-seamer, which sits at 89-92 mph and reaches 94 while generating a lot of groundouts with its run and sink. He threw both a curveball and a slider as a high school senior with little differentiation between the two breaking balls, so Los Angeles had him focus on a hard curve that also elicits grounders and should become a solid offering.  Though his changeup is in its early stages and is too firm at this point, May shows some aptitude for the pitch.

Despite a torn labrum suffered during his first full season in 2015, and a broken thumb that kept him from going to the Arizona Fall League at the end of 2017, it's hard to argue Tucker isn't way ahead of the curve after reaching Double-A shortly following his 21st birthday.  Cole's offensive game continues to grow as he matures. The switch-hitter is more natural from the left side, but his overall approach has improved and his walk rate has gone up. He makes a lot of contact and there should be more power to come as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. Tucker led the Florida State League in stolen bases even though he was promoted after 68 games and topped the organization in steals with 47 in 2017. That speed helps him defensively as well, and he should stay at short long-term, with an arm that has bounced back to a tick above average since that shoulder surgery.

He was at it again in 2017 and even though he struggled upon earning a promotion to Double-A and missed a few weeks with a wrist issue, he still finished third in the system in slugging percentage and fifth in home runs.  Long's left-handed bat is his calling card. Despite his 5-foot-8 frame, Long has shown the ability to consistently impact the baseball. The power is legitimate, coming from outstanding bat speed and very quick hands. He does strike out some, but his walk rate went up in 2017 and he's shown a willingness to use all fields. Possessing average speed at best, Long is an aggressive baserunner who swiped 21 bases in 2016, though that number decreased to nine in 2017. A catcher when he first began his pro career, he moved to second in 2015, allowing his bat to take off, and he's worked to become an adequate defensive infielder.  As long as he can maintain average, or close to it, defense, Long should have a long career as an offensive-minded second baseman.

Peralta continued to trend in the right direction in 2017, receiving his first Double-A promotion in late June and pitching well there after a dominant first half in the FSL.   Peralta makes up for being an undersized righty by generating enormous extension to plate, causing his low-90s fastball that touches 94 mph to play up consistently. The pitch is his primary source of whiffs, many of which he induces inside the strike zone, and was at the heart of his Minor League-best .178 batting average against among starters in 2017. His short slider and changeup are both Major League offerings, with the changeup currently ranking ahead of the slider in the eyes of many scouts. Peralta's penchant for generating whiffs helps to offset his below-average control, an aspect of his game that requires further refinement after he issued a career-high 4.7 walks-per-nine in '17.

Those plate-discipline and mechanical problems resulting in a Carolina League-leading 156 strikeouts (and 31 percent strikeout rate), though Ray did walk at a decent clip. Trusting his hands, learning to better recognize spin and becoming more comfortable driving the ball the other way could do wonders for Ray's production.   Ray's plus speed makes him a threat to steal, but his jumps on the basepaths require refinement. His wheels also serve him well in center field, where he's seen the bulk of his playing time as a pro and shows at least average arm strength.

Since he signed for an over-slot $855,000 as a fourth-rounder that June, the only thing that has slowed him is an abdominal strain that cost him two months last summer.

With his advanced pitch-recognition skills and feel for the barrel, Welker rarely gets fooled and consistently makes hard contact.

Multiple Rockies officials have noted that Welker reminds them of a young Nolan Arenado because they have similar builds and put up similar numbers in their first two years of pro ball.

An above-average runner, McCarthy moves well for his size, both on the basepaths and in the outfield. His only below-average tool is his arm strength, which relegates him to left field, but he has made strides in improving his versatility by adding first base to his defensive resume.   McCarthy gets the most out of his tools, and it's those intangibles that have the Rays believing he can at least carve out a role as a bench bat who compensates for modest power with speed and strong on-base skills.

He did just that in 2017, hitting a career-high 24 home runs, up from 13 the previous year, to pace all Minor League shortstops, while also posting an extra-base hit rate of nearly 55 percent. Chang's game will always feature some swing-and-miss, and he struck out at a career-high 26 percent clip in Double-A, but the overall approach is solid. He'll never be much of a basestealing threat despite possessing speed that's slightly above average.    A shortstop exclusively since the start of 2014, Chang has the athleticism and requisite tools to stay there. The presence of superstar Francisco Lindor in Cleveland means he won't, however, and Chang is expected to see increased reps at other positions going forward. One possibility is a move to third base, where Chang's strong arm and right-handed power would be clean fits.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VDPqWbix08?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""NYM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2012""","""Taiwan""","""June 3, 2013 - CLE""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CLE""","""cle""","""CLE""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,45,55,50,45,50,45,55,55,50,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,50,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The big right-hander was shelved by a groin injury for the first month of his junior season but excelled upon returning, going 6-1 with a 3.10 ERA and averaging more than a strikeout per inning in 10 starts. The Blue Jays made Zeuch their first-round pick in 2016, taking him 21st overall, and then signed him for $2.175 million, slightly under slot value for the pick. While a back injury limited Zeuch's mound time during his first full season, he still put himself on the big league radar, showing power stuff as well as plus ground-ball tendencies with Class A Advanced Dunedin that carried over to his Arizona Fall League campaign.   Zeuch is a physical presence on the mound and knows how to use his 6-foot-7 frame to create a steep downhill angle to the plate. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph but typically sits in the 91-94 mph range, with outstanding late run and sinking action that helps him generate a plethora of weak ground balls. Zeuch will use both a slider and a curve effectively, with the former occasionally flashing above average and the curve showing good shape with some downer action. He seldom used his changeup as an amateur but has demonstrated decent feel for the pitch as a pro. He repeats his delivery well in spite of his size and throws strikes with his entire arsenal.  The development of Zeuch's secondary arsenal -- some scouts would like to see him establish more separation between his breaking balls -- as well as his ability to stay healthy will determine whether or not he reaches his ceiling of a No. 3 starter. Should that not work out, the right-hander has undeniable upside as a high-leverage reliever who generates as many whiffs as he does weakly hit outs.""",,,,,"""|""","""CHA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Pittsburgh""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""","""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,40,50,40,,,,40,60,45,55,45,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,45,50,55,,,,50

The power has carried over as a pro and he reached Double-A in his first full season of pro ball despite missing six weeks with a broken hand.  Alonso made some mechanical adjustments during that junior year at Florida, and the shorter swing he used has continued to serve him well.

A strong 2016 season raised expectations for 2017, but while Banda did make his big league debut, he had a tough year overall. It will now be up to the Rays to further Banda's development after they acquired him as part of a three-team trade with the Yankees in February.   Banda had trouble finding a rhythm during the 2017 season as he rode the Reno-Arizona shuttle at times, often getting thrown from his routine. That did not help him learn to deal with the struggles he faced, both in the tough pitching environment of Reno and in the big leagues. There's still a lot to like about Banda's stuff, though, starting with a fastball that was up to 97 mph pitching in relief at the end of the year. He could settle into the 93-95 mph range when all is said and done. His curveball flashes plus, but it was inconsistent at times last year and he has good enough feel for his changeup to envision it eventually being consistently average.

Both pitchers wound up with IMG Academy's (Bradenton, Fla.) post-graduate program and were drafted once again in 2015, with Nix going to the Padres in the third round and signing for $900,000. He impressed during his full-season debut with Class A Fort Wayne the following year, and continued to climb the ladder in 2017, earning a promotion from Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore to Double-A San Antonio in early August even though he missed the first six weeks of the season with a groin strain.   An athletic and projectable right-hander, Nix generates easy velocity with his fluid delivery and smooth arm action. He operates at 93-95 mph and reaches 97 with his fastball, locating it to both sides of the plate while maintaining velocity deep into games. Nix's curveball gives him a second plus pitch, one thrown with power, depth and bite in the low 80s, and his changeup should be at least average once fully developed. He's a strike-thrower with all three pitches, and has issued just 1.9 walks-per-nine innings in three professional seasons, but Nix's ability to miss bats and overall hittability leaves much to be desired.   Despite being limited by a groin injury in 2017, Nix has proved plenty durable early in his career and should continue to add good strength. Nix has a chance at becoming a No. 3 starter if he can miss more bats and improve his changeup, while his two-plus pitches and above-average command give him a solid, back-of-the-rotation floor.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/LM9yJp5lRaI?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""KC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""3rd rd 2015""","""IMG Academy HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SDP""","""sd""","""SD""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,50,,,,,45,60,55,60,,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,50,60,,,,,55

That decision paid off as he hit his way into first-round consideration, and the Twins were happy to take him again in 2017, this time with the 35th overall pick in the Draft. He made it up to the Florida State League during his summer debut and managed to finish second in the system in home runs.  During his final season at Mississipi State, Rooker changed his set up at the plate, learning to use his lower half more and shortening up his stroke. It made him a better overall hitter, one who could tap into his considerable raw power more consistently, and that carried over into his pro debut. A total of 18 homers in 62 games might be too much to ask long term, but the Twins feel Rooker's plus power is legit and will continue to play. There's some swing and miss to his game, but he also draws walks. A first baseman in college, the Twins sent the deceptively athletic Rooker to left field during his pro debut, and that's where he'll continue to get the bulk of his playing time.  The Twins have typically been a bit more methodical in the past in terms of development, but Rooker's skills at the plate should allow him to test that and continue to move quickly towards Minnesota.""",,,,,"""|""","""DET""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2017""","""Mississippi State""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIN""","""min""","""MIN""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,40,65,40,40,45,40,60,65,40,45,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,60,50,50,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

It was that athleticism, along with his promising bat and present feel for the game, which led the Padres to sign him for $1.85 million on July 2. He showed all of those qualities during his 2017 professional debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League, where he finished with a .299 average and a .404 on-base percentage, the latter a product of him walking (33) nearly as often as he struck out (36).   Rosario has natural hitting ability thanks to a combination of bat speed, barrel control and hand-eye coordination. He has quick hands and makes lot of hard contact from the left side of the plate, and it is believed that he could develop average power as he grows into his lean and athletic frame. Rosario's above-average speed enables him to cover ground with graceful strides in the outfield, and club officials are optimistic about his chances of remaining in center field.  Rosario, like so many of his fellow J2 Padres peers, proved to be an advanced all-around prospect in his first pro campaign. He will need considerable time to develop in the Minors, but the finished product could be that of an everyday bat-first regular.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/tz3B5XbWgMc?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2016""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 2, 2016 - SD""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SDP""","""sd""","""SD""","""|""",0,1,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,30,45,55,40,55,60,50,50,55,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,45,55,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Murray was a nationally-known superstar quarterback in high school and, though he played shortstop as well, it was assumed that Murray would be the heir apparent to Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M. A shoulder injury limited Murray to DH'ing as a senior in high school and Murray formally opted out of the draft by refusing to submit to MLB's pre-draft medical disclosure. He went to A&M but split time with Kyle Allen as a freshman. Each of them transferred, Murray to Oklahoma, where he backed up Heisman winner and #1 overall pick, Baker Mayfield. For much of this time, Murray wasn't playing baseball.Football at A&M and the time missed due to NCAA transerring rules limited Murray to 64 college plate appearances before this season. Despite it, he has been electric, showing even more physical ability than he had in high school and performing, slashing .290/.390/.550. He shows everything scouts could want to see after this kind of layoff and his only clear weakness is swing-and-miss against good off-speed stuff, both somewhat allowed with his power-based approach. And even more forgiveable when you consider he hasn't seen good pitching on a regular basis at any point in his baseball career. Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance he may be able to close that hole in his game with reps.Murray is projected, but not a lock, to win Oklahoma's QB job in the fall. Teams aren't sure how much it would take to get him to give up football or if there's even a number that would do it, but some teams are kicking around multi-million dollar offers to see if they can buy him out. Given his size, baseball likely offers the most financial upside unless he's a Heisman level performer this year. With some recent changes to the CBA, spreading a bonus over 5 years and letting him play football (like the Blue Jays did with CF Anthony Alford) isn't really an option anymore.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 50 | Run: 70 | Arm: 40 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  The best athlete in the 2015 Draft, Murray drew first-round interest from several clubs but opted out of the process because he was also the nation's top-rated dual threat quarterback prospect and wanted to play football and baseball at Texas A&M. Despite playing regularly as a freshman for the Aggies, he opted to transfer to Oklahoma, where he had to sit out 2016 before backing up Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield last fall. After looking overmatched at the plate in his return to baseball with the Sooners last spring and in the Cape Cod League last summer, he has shown dramatic improvement as a redshirt sophomore.  Though he continues to juggle two sports and has lost a lot of at-bats while doing so, Murray has made impressive adjustments at the plate. He's making better contact and no longer is easy prey for breaking balls, doing a better job of recognizing them and not chasing them off the plate. He has the plus-plus speed to create havoc on the bases and the bat speed and strength to produce average power.  The son of former Texas A&M quarterback and Brewers farmhand Kevin Murray and the nephew of two-time first-rounder and five-year big leaguer Calvin Murray, Kyler still needs to reduce his strikeouts further and is a work in progress defensively. He's learning reads and routes but has the quickness to outrun his mistakes and eventually could become at least a solid center fielder. His arm has regressed on the diamond and currently plays below average.  With his tools and the surprising progress he has made in 2018, Murray once again is in position to command a multimillion-dollar bonus. However, it may be virtually impossible to get him to give up football when he's a leading contender to helm one of college football's top offenses. He'll turn 21 shortly after the Draft and needs to get going with his baseball career if that's going to be his future.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/xmMP-OHxKp8?autoplay=1""","""|""","""STL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""OAK""",9,,,,"""|""","""Oklahoma""","""""","""Oklahoma""","""RS Sophomore""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""","""++""","""-""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,70,40,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He built on that performance in 2016 at Class A Advanced Lynchburg, where, at age 20, he established career bests in home runs (29) and RBIs (102) en route to the Carolina League MVP award. It was more of the same for Bradley in his first Double-A campaign, as he connected on 23 more home runs while also improving his approach and making more contact.  Bradley's plus power has translated at every stop in his career. He can apply it to all fields during games thanks to a combination of strength, bat speed and natural hitting ability, though he was too pull-happy at times in 2017. After striking out 29.7 percent of the time in 2016, Bradley trimmed his whiff rate down to 22.9 percent in Double-A, all while maintaining the same healthy walk rate he's shown throughout his career. There is some concern regarding his hit-tool potential, but Bradley has made enough strides with his approach and pitch recognition to believe it could be at least below average. He's a well-below-average runner and below average at first base, though he did make gains defensively with extra reps in the Arizona Fall League.

He had a history of success as an amateur, including winning the home run derby at the Under Armour All-America Game in 2016 and starring for the U.S. 18-and-under team that won a gold medal at the Pan American Games later that year. He signed for $1,425,400, turning down the chance to play at Oklahoma State, where his father James is an assistant coach.  Vilade grew up around the game and gets universal praise for his makeup and instincts, and he also has a chance to be a dynamic offensive performer. He has a quick right-handed swing that already produces pull power and should deliver home runs to all fields once he gets stronger. He has shown the ability to make adjustments at the plate and his patience was obvious when he walked 27 times in a 33-game pro debut shortened by a lower back injury.  Most amateur scouts projected that Vilade will outgrow shortstop, though he looked a little better than expected in his debut. He's an average runner who may slow a bit as he fills out and doesn't have the quickest first step, but his instincts and strong arm help him make plays. Colorado plans on trying him at third base and he also could fit at second base or in the outfield, but there are no immediate plans to move him off shortstop.""",,,,,"""|""","""CIN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2017""","""Stillwater HS (OK)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""COL""","""col""","""COL""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,30,55,45,45,55,50,55,60,40,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,55,45,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He has an advanced approach at the plate and has been described as looking ""hitterish"" in the box by some evaluators.

The Yankees took Kaprielian 16th overall, making him the highest-drafted college pitcher in franchise history, and then signed him for $2.65 million. Unfortunately, injuries have subsequently derailed Kaprielian's development, as a strained flexor muscle in his forearm limited him to just three starts in is first full season, while Tommy John surgery the following spring wiped out his entire 2017 campaign. It will now be up to the A's to get Kaprielian back on track after they acquired him, Dustin Fowler and Jorge Mateo for Sonny Gray at the Trade Deadline.    After working at 88-92 mph in college with a fastball that stood out more for its sink and command than it did for velocity, Kaprielian saw his velocity jump to 93-96 mph while touching 99 upon entering pro ball.

He tore up Rookie ball after signing for $3,282,000, a franchise record for a hitter, but batted just .260/.326/.348 with two homers in 101 Class A games in his first full season. New York sent him to the White Sox in July as part of a four-player package for Todd Frazier, David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle.  Though Rutherford failed to post big numbers in 2017, there were positives. He recognized pitches, made consistent contact and showed a willingness to use all fields, all of which bode well for him hitting for a high average. Chicago believes his size, strength, bat speed and left-handed stroke will translate into at least average power once he learns which pitches he can drive.  Sometimes compared to a more athletic version of David Justice, Rutherford could have average or better tools across the board. He figures to slow down a bit as he matures physically, so he's unlikely to remain in center field despite spending most of his first two pro seasons there.

Ortiz improved in every facet of his game while playing at age 18 a year ago and he would have led his league in OPS had he played enough to qualify. Everyone has known his raw power was legit and he started to tap into it during games more while becoming a more complete hitter. He can hit the ball out of any park and to all fields, showing the ability to go the other way. He'll still strike out some, but it's looking like he's going to make more than enough contact to be an average hitter. When he first signed, many thought he'd be limited to first base, but he's proven to be way more agile than anyone anticipated, has worked hard on his outfield play and should be a solid average defender with a strong arm for right field in the future.  In addition to his tremendous offensive skills, Ortiz gets high marks for his work ethic and desire to improve. He spent a good part of last fall in Clearwater, working on strength, conditioning and nutrition.

For an athlete who divided his attention between multiple sports, Thompson isn't nearly as raw as might be expected.

While no one will ever mistake the smaller left-hander for a flamethrower, an uptick in overall stuff has certainly helped Suarez, as he missed more bats in 2017 than he had previously in his career. The velocity of his fastball his increased and he's now averaging 91 mph with it and touching 93 mph, thrown with good life to get ground-ball outs. He might have the best changeup in the system that fooled hitters on both sides of the plate and his big, looping curve improved as well, going from a third pitch that needed a ton of work to a third pitch he can count on. He can throw strikes with all three pitches, all coming from a very easy and repeatable delivery.    There is a big up arrow next to Suarez's name currently as he pitches at age 20 in 2018.

He improved his feel for a fading changeup while with the U.S. collegiate national team in 2016 and it should develop into a reliable third option if he uses it more often.  When Lange commands his fastball and curveball, he looks like a frontline starter. When he overthrows and gets offline to the plate, he costs himself control and appears more destined for the bullpen. While he could race to Wrigley Field in a relief role, the Cubs hope he develops into mid-rotation starter.""",,,,,"""|""","""CHC""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2017""","""LSU""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CHC""","""chc""","""CHC""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,30,60,,,,,40,50,45,70,,,,,45,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",55,50,65,,,,,45

He ranked third in the short-season New York-Penn League in hitting (.321) and on-base percentage (.412) in his debut, then finished second (.301) and first (.397) in those categories the Class A Advanced Florida State League despite skipping the Class A level entirely. After finishing 2017 with a strong month in Double-A, Solak was acquired by Tampa Bay in February as part of a three-team trade involving the D-backs.   Solak has excelled at hitting for average and has gotten on base at every level at which he has played. He makes repeated line-drive contact with a quick right-handed swing and a gap-to-gap approach. While he's not a huge home run threat, he can drive the ball to the gaps, and his 12 homers in 2017 were two more than he totaled in three years of college.  Though he drew comparisons to former Yankee Robert Refsnyder during his time in their system, Solak has a better chance to make it as an everyday second baseman because of his superior speed and defense. His solid speed enhances his on-base ability and he has the instincts to provide double-digit steals on an annual basis.

Full Report:  Kowar had a seven figure asking price coming out of high school that was just out of reach for clubs. He was set to head to Clemson until a late coaching change and the Tigers lost Kowar to Florida and Cal Raleigh (lower on this list) to Florida State. Kowar's velocity ticked up before he even played in an official game for the Gators, sitting 93-95 and hitting 97 mph in preseason scrimmages before his freshman year. He's kept that velocity for the most part throughout his college career and he's also kept the plus changeup that he's had since back in high school. The two issues for Kowar are his very short stride, which causes his velocity to play down and secondly, his breaking ball. It's never been good and it got close to average with the velo spike improving his arm speed, but it's still most often a below average pitch, with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape.A good pitching program may be able to tweak the pitch using TrackMan or Rapsodo in a pitch design type setting, or just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. This is almost an identical issue to what Luke Weaver had coming out of Florida State and he's largely solved it with the help of a good pitching program with the Cardinals, so the team that picks Kowar could have a bigger influence in his outcome than most comparable talents.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 65 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 55    While Brady Singer understandably gets most of the attention in terms of the Florida Gators staff, recent history should show the school typically has a deep stable of arms for scouts to evaluate. Kowar pitched behind 2017 first-rounder Alex Faedo and Singer in the weekend rotation last year, opened some eyes with how he threw this fall to jump up on Draft radars and continued to cement himself as a first-round pick this spring    Kowar's size and live arm make him stand out immediately. With a clean, repeatable delivery and easy arm action, the 6-foot-5 right-hander was up to 98 mph this fall and can sit in the mid 90s with ease. It can be a little bit too true at times, in contrast to Singer's live heater, leading to a lower strikeout rate during his sophomore year than one would expect. His changeup is his best secondary offering, a plus pitch right now. His breaking ball is behind the other two, but it will flash above-average at times. He generally throws strikes and his command should improve with a solid delivery.    With some projection and that arm strength, there's some room for growth on the mound. There are some who like Kowar nearly as much as Singer, and the two have combined to be another exciting 1-2 punch in Gainesville.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6Gnu6dq3LLQ?autoplay=1""","""|""","""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""KC""",33,,,,"""|""","""Florida""","""""","""Florida""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",1,0,0,1,"""|""","""+""","""+""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",65,60,50,,,,,50

Full Report:  Schnell moved up into the thick of prep outfielders in the late-first through early-second round mix this spring because he has gone bonkers at the plate this year, launching home runs seemingly in every game, often more than once. Schnell is a 55 to 60 runner with a plus arm that has a chance to stick in center field, depending on how his frame fills out and how his quickness develops. He projects for plus raw power and has been getting to it in games. That said, many of his homers this spring, against middling competition, have been to the opposite field and some scouts are worried that a deep hand load/arm bar is making him late on less-than-premium stuff rather than him showing impressive opposite field game power.Schnell also has a bit of a medical history, with a multi-sport background that includes multiple concussions and numerous other lesser injuries. The upside here is 5 hit and 6 everything else which is considerable and many draft models give extra credit to hitters from Northern states that are young for the class and Schnell is both.

The best of that group is Schnell, who helped Roncalli (Indianapolis) to the Indiana 4-A state championship in 2016 and will be the first player ever drafted from the school. He performed well on the showcase circuit last summer, displaying a consistent all-around game.  Schnell has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame.

He spent parts of the next two seasons in the Dominican Summer League before finally making his U.S. debut with Class A Short Season Hudson Valley in late 2016.

The switch-hitting Brujan is advanced from both sides of the plate. He already knows how to control the strike zone at a young age and recognizes pitches well, with bat-to-ball skills and a knack for making hard contact that led scouts to project him as an above-average hitter in the future. That Brujan rarely strikes out and has strong on-base skills to go along with natural hitting ability underscores his potential as a top-of-the-order presence, a profile that's only enhanced by his well-above-average speed and impact potential on the basepaths.  Brujan's wheels translate to exceptional range at second base, where he profiles as a slightly above-average defender with average arm strength.

His left-handed swing is both quick and controlled, and he knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone with his long arms to generate considerable raw power, even if it is yet to manifest during games. The same bat path leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss -- his 144 strikeouts in 2017 ranked seventh among Midwest League hitters -- though he is athletic enough to make the necessary adjustments to his swing in the coming years. Once he's done so, it doesn't take much to envision him hitting for both average and power. The Rays are confident in Lowe's abilities as a hitter and see the sky as his ceiling given the remaining physical projection in his ultra-athletic frame.   After struggling at third base during his pro debut, Lowe was shifted to center field during fall instructional league and immediately proved a natural, with his plus speed and long, graceful strides fueling his impressive range. The Rays think he has a real chance to stick there, and he certainly has more than enough arm strength -- he pitched with a low-to-mid-90s fastball as a prep -- to handle either outfield corner.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0xP4kchoVfA?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""NYM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""Pope HS (GA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TBR""","""tb""","""TB""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,20,60,60,45,60,50,45,60,60,55,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,60,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

While he might not be quite as dynamic as his brother, Contreras is an athletic backstop with intriguing skills on both sides of the ball. He has a strong arm and agility that helps him with blocking and receiving. He runs well for a catcher and has shown a solid approach at the plate, with a solid walk rate and the ability to hit the ball hard to all fields. He might jump on a first-pitch fastball for a home run in one at-bat, then lace a two-strike double to right-center in the next.

Cumberland showed, at least during his time with Rome in the South Atlantic League, that his power will play.

Full Report:  Denaburg is a legitimate pro prospect as a catcher, but it's clear that he fits best on the mound. His stuff was at it's best early in the spring when he was heavily scouted in a matchup with Carter Stewart. Denaburg was up to 97 mph with one of the most consistently 60-grade breaking balls in recent memory, which he located well. He came back last week after he missing a month with biceps tendinitis and while the curveball wasn't all the way back (expected), his changeup took center stage, flashing above average and striking out Triston Casas twice in the region final. As important as the pure quality Denaburg's breaking stuff is, his ability to keep it down beneath the strike zone, and to his glove side is also significant. He'll be able to attack both-handed hitters in that spot as soon as he steps on a pro mound. He's a high-ceiling high school arm who had some injury problems this spring. He's in teams' mixes in the 16-25 range.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  There were several question marks regarding Denaburg, even after a strong summer showcase showing that ended with helping USA Baseball's 18-and-under team win a gold medal. Was he a pitcher or a position player? Would he want to do both at the University of Florida. An accomplished kicker and punter, would he want to keep playing football in college? All of those were trumped somewhat by a biceps issue that sidelined him this spring.  One of the questions seemingly answered is about his desire to pitch. Denaburg had been a catcher when not on the mound, but he'd moved out to the outfield as a senior and seems dedicated to a future as a hurler, though the chance to play two ways for the Gators might still be out there for him. He's been up to 97 mph in the past with his fastball, sitting around 94, throwing it with good life down in the zone. When he stays on top of it, his power breaking ball has nasty break and finish to it, and he shows feel for a solid changeup as well.     There's some upside here to unlock, given Denaburg's split focus, both because of his two-way history on the diamond and his time spent on the gridiron. He has a good, strong body that reminds some of John Smoltz, with a chance for his stuff to jump once he concentrates on his craft full-time. Returning to the mound in May helped prove he's healthy and cement that he has serious first-round potential.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/UE-e6imiR6U?autoplay=1""","""|""","""BAL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""WSH""",27,,,,"""|""","""Merritt Island HS FL""","""Florida""","""Merritt Island (Fla.)

Small frame means little power projection.    Full Report:  Questions about Thomas surround his physicality, or lack thereof, despite a long track record of hitting against elite competition at events around the country. It's rare that a high school hitter from Chicago is so advanced, especially one as young as Thomas, and he runs well enough to project in center field, which makes that lack of power projection on the frame less concerning.

If he follows through on his commitment to Texas Christian, he wants to try to double as an outfielder in baseball and a slot receiver in football. Gatorade's 2017 Illinois baseball player of the year as a junior, he has the hitting ability and athleticism to get drafted high enough to forego college.  With his compact left-handed stroke, impressive bat speed and mature approach at the plate, Thomas smacks line drives to all fields. He has no trouble barreling quality fastballs and led gold medal-winning Team USA in hitting with a .361 average at the 18-and-under World Cup in September. Though he's not very physical, his feel for the barrel and sneaky pop should produce at least 12-15 homers per year in pro ball.  Thomas enhances his plus speed with good instincts on the bases and in center field. While he has below-average arm strength, it's playable in center field.

After a hamstring injury limited him to just 59 games at Class A Wisconsin in his first full season, Grisham enjoyed a healthy 2017 campaign in the Class A Advanced Carolina League, where he finished among the circuit leaders with 98 walks (first), 78 runs scored (tied-second) and 37 steals (third), but also batted just .223 while slugging .348.  Grisham is still in search of his comfort zone in the batter's box. He employs a passive approach that translates to many walks and solid on-base skills, but also a high strikeout rate and excessive weak contact. The Brewers hope he can find better balance to said approach in future seasons and see it as key towards Grisham unlocking his offensive potential. When he's at his best, and his swing is consistent, Grisham shows advanced bat-to-ball skills, with a stroke that consistently produces line drives and hints at future power potential.   Grisham's hamstring injury has detracted from his speed, but he's still an average runner who earns high praise for his ability to read pitchers and steal bases, which he did at an 88.1-percent clip in 2017. Defensively, Grisham is capable of playing all three outfield positions, though his fringe-average arm strength is a cleaner fit in center field or left than right.

He opened eyes with his performance on both sides of the ball during a strong pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and then improved his stock even more in his first full season. Spending his age-19 season in the Class A South Atlantic League, Nelson's .309 average ranked second in the circuit and first in the organization. It earned him honors as both a mid- and post-season All-Star, and the Marlins named him their Minor League Player of the Year after the season.   Nelson shows good feel for hitting, with a short, clean swing from the right side that yields consistently hard contact to all fields. A doubles machine early in his career, scouts believe Nelson will develop average over-the-fence based on his projectable frame, bat speed and leveraged plane through the hitting zone. Nelson's average speed serves him well as a baserunner as well as in the field. A shortstop as an amateur, Nelson has since transitioned to the hot corner. He profiles as an average defender there, with good athleticism and range as well as a plus arm, though he has been prone to defensive lapses early in his career.   Nelson's first two pro seasons already has him looking like one of the biggest steals of the 2016 Draft. Set to play all of 2018 at age 20, Nelson's across-the-board tools, feel for the game and remaining physical projection all point towards him becoming an everyday third baseman at the highest level.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""15th rd 2016""","""Cisco JC (TX)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIA""","""mia""","""MIA""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,30,50,50,50,55,50,50,55,50,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,50,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Signed back in 2012 out of the Dominican Republic, it took until his fifth summer as a pro to reach full-season ball in 2017. He jumped firmly on the prospect map, earning a late promotion up to the Florida State League while finishing second in the system in ERA, wins and strikeouts.   Blessed with tremendous arm strength, Soto's ultimate role will be determined how far he can come in harnessing it and learning how to pitch. He'll sit in the low 90s with a lively fastball that misses bats and induces ground-ball contact. His secondary pitchers are still works in progress but all ticked upwards in 2017, showing a breaking ball that should be Major League aveage and a fringy, though usable, changeup. Command is still a major issue for him, though his walk rate did come down a touch and he threw more strikes during his brief time with Lakeland.  Continued refinement of both his secondary stuff and command will allow Soto to stay in a rotation, something he'll continue doing for the time being, with the Tigers knowing the power left arm will work just fine out of a bullpen.

Elbow issues would subsequently derail Harvey's progress, however, costing him part of 2014 and all of '15 before he ultimately required Tommy John surgery in June '16.

Owner of a fastball that sits in the 92-95 mph range and reaches 96-97, Harvey also commands the pitch to both sides of the plate thanks to a smooth delivery as well as a whippy-but-clean arm action. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball that he throws with tight spin and considerable depth to create late downer action and pile up whiffs, while Harvey's changeup gives him a third average-or-better offering.  His injury history aside, Harvey is still loaded with upside. The strength he's added in recent years to his formerly wiry frame has helped to assuage some concerns about his durability, and Orioles officials believe he's now better off physically after going through a structured strengthening and throwing program.

After finding new representation, the then-17-year-old Cuban outfielder signed with Oakland for $3 million at the start of the 2016-17 international period. He made his professional debut the next year in the Dominican Summer League, where he appeared in just six games before heading stateside for an impressive showing in the Rookie-level Arizona League.    Armenteros stands out for his hitting ability, raw power, speed and overall athleticism, the combination of which gives him the potential for four average-or-better tools. His bat speed is explosive and fuels his projection as an average hitter with above-average power, though his bat path through the zone, as well as his approach and overall plate discipline, will need to be ironed out.

That's because most didn't realize Friedl was a Draft-eligible sophomore at Nevada-Reno until after the Draft. He was playing well for the U.S. National Collegiate Team when a bidding war of sorts ensued, won by the Reds, who gave him $735,000 to sign. Friedl hit well in the Midwest League (.850 OPS) during his first full season, then fizzled a bit after a promotion to the Florida State League.    Friedl has a good idea of what he wants to do at the plate, with a contact-oriented approach. He puts the ball in play, sending line drives to the gaps without striking out much and drawing a decent amount of walks. While he's never going to be a huge home run guy, he does have a little sneaky pop and might run into a few homers. His plus speed works on both sides of the ball, allowing him to take an extra base as well as steal a few of them. It also plays well in the outfield. He's seen time in all three outfield spots, but he's better suited in center or left because of his fringy arm.    In all likelihood, Friedl will fit the fourth outfielder mold really well. If his bat comes around a little bit more, he could be an everyday outfielder, though it would have to be in center since he doesn't fit the offensive profile for a corner spot.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/P3qreU_0HUc?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""Undrafted 2016""","""Nevada""","""Aug. 4, 2016 - CIN""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CIN""",,"""CIN""","""|""",1,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,30,45,70,50,45,55,40,50,70,60,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,40,70,45,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Groshans is a pretty volatile power-hitting prospect who currently plays shortstop on his high school team but probably ends up at third base, and maybe an outfield corner, at maturity. A portion of the industry would also like to smooth out Groshans' swing, but he's shown natural bat control and has the strength in his hands to do damage even if he doesn't time his stride well. This was evident last summer in the PG All American game when Groshans tomahawked a 95mph fastball off the Western Metal Supply building at Petco. There's some swing and miss risk here, which is particularly troubling if you don't like Groshans' hands and think he ends up in right field, but the tools package is electric and he could be selected in the middle of round 1 and probably doesn't get out of the comp round.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 50 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Though Magnolia (Texas) High has sent more than two dozen players to college programs, it never has had a player drafted before the 20th round. That should change in 2018, as the Bulldogs have a pair of potential first-rounders in Groshans and right-hander Adam Kloffenstein. Groshans is one of the better all-around hitters in the prep class and doesn't have a glaring weakness.  Groshans has a quick right-handed stroke and has a track record of catching up to and punishing quality fastballs on the showcase circuit. With his strength, balance and mature approach, he makes consistent hard line-drive contact. Once he fills out his rangy 6-foot-4 frame and adds some loft to his swing, he could have plus power.  An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, Groshans is athletic for his size but won't stay at shortstop after he leaves Magnolia. His solid arm will play anywhere in the infield, where he probably fits best at third base but may have a chance to stick up the middle at second, and he has the makeup to get the most out of his ability.

His elite toolset reminds some of Byron Buxton or Royce Lewis, but the track record is very short.    Full Report:  Adams was not talked about as a top-3 round prospect in this class before late-March's NHSI tournament in his home town of Cary. Adams wasn't even one of the top dozen prospects at the event when it started, but looked like a sure first day pick by the end of the event. He offers top of the scale athleticism, which you'd expect from one of the top dozen wide receiver prospects in the country. He has 80 speed, a loose swing, plus bat control, projectable raw power and athletic actions. Adams wasn't a top tier baseball prospect entering the spring in part because of limited reps, since he was seen as likely to go to North Carolina to play football, where his father is the defensive line coach. He's now in line for a multi-million dollar bonus offer and is expected to sign.

Also a four-star wide receiver recruit, he's committed to play football and baseball at North Carolina, where his father Deke is a defensive line coach. Teams believe he may prefer to play football, though some will consider him in the first round if they believe he can be lured away from the Tar Heels.  After looking overmatched at times on the showcase circuit last summer, Adams had no problem handling quality pitching at the NHSI. He made repeated hard contact with his quick right-handed swing and displayed at least average raw power. He employs a big leg kick and doesn't have much track record offensively, but he has the upside of a solid hitter with 15-20 homers per year.  Adams' most explosive tool is his speed, which earns top-of-the-scale 80 grades from some evaluators. Just with his sheer quickness, Adams can steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field, and he potentially could be elite in both areas if he devoted his full attention to baseball. He has fringy arm strength, which is more than playable in center, and it could improve if he got on a throwing program.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dsaEZPyd02Y?autoplay=1""","""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""LAA""",17,,,,"""|""","""Green Hope HS NC""","""North Carolina""","""Green Hope (N.C.)

After he continued to swing the bat well early in his first full season, the A's landed Neuse, left-hander Jesus Luzardo and reliever Blake Treinen in the July deal that sent Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to D.C. Neuse posted a .380 average in 40 games while reaching Double-A after joining the A's system, and then he continued to elevate his stock in the Arizona Fall League, where he finished in the top three in the circuit in RBIs, doubles, extra-base hits, runs scored, total bases, slugging and home runs.     Neuse's right-handed swing is short and simple, but he also keeps his barrel in the hitting zone for an extended period of time and drives the ball across the whole field. He has above-average raw power and already knows how to get to it in games, a notion supported by his 16 home runs and 26 doubles across three levels in 2017. Some scouts still question how it will translate at higher levels because his game does have some swing-and-miss tendencies, albeit with sound overall plate discipline.    Neuse is a fringe-average runner who shows good instincts on the bases and in the field. A shortstop in college, Neuse saw time there as well as third base prior to being dealt, but he handled the hot corner exclusively after joining the A's. He profiles as an average defender there, with soft hands, good range and a plus arm that produced 94 mph off the mound in college.

They dealt him to the Brewers in July the following year, packaging him with Adrian Houser, Domingo Santana and Josh Hader to land Carlos Gomez and Mike Fiers. Phillips struggled in his first full Double-A campaign but rebounded in 2017 in the hitter-friendly Triple-A Pacific Coast League to earn his first Major League callup in June. He went on to appear in 37 games over four stints with Milwaukee, hitting .276 with four home runs and five steals.   Phillips has a short, compact swing from the left side that produces hard contact across the whole field, though at times he can get too long with his stroke and pull-happy with his approach. His power has played at every level in his career, and there's enough raw power and patience to project for average power as a Major Leaguer. Phillips' above-average speed makes him a threat on the basepaths, and he's worked hard to improve his basestealing technique and reads.   That Phillips offers above-average defense as a center fielder also qualifies him to play both corner-outfield spots. His incredible arm produced in September the second-hardest throw (104 mph) ever recorded by Statcast and has long served him well across all three outfield positions.

Texas dealt him with relief prospects Erik Swanson and Nick Green to get Carlos Beltran from the Yankees in July 2017, and while Tate has looked better with his new organization, his future still is somewhat murky.    Tate resisted incorporating some delivery changes the Rangers wanted in his first full pro season, after which his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches flattened out. Since New York allowed him to return to his college mechanics after the trade, his four-seam fastball again sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 98, and he's also working on a two-seamer to induce ground balls.

He was the youngest ERA qualifier (ages 20 and 21) in each circuit as well.  Castellani's fastball sat around 90 mph in high school but now runs from 92-97 mph with arm-side run and sink that should help him deal with Coors Field. When he doesn't get around his low-80s slider, he shows the ability to throw it for strikes and to back-foot it against left-handers. His fading changeup slipped a little in 2017 but can be a solid pitch when he maintains his arm speed and slot when he throws it.   Colorado officials compare his less-than-smooth mechanics to Max Scherzer's, and like the three-time Cy Young Award winner in his younger days, Castellani's biggest need is consistent command. He has a fast arm and repeats his delivery, which allows him to throw strikes.

He made a smooth transition to starting in 2017, when he came to the Giants as part of a July trade for Eduardo Nunez.  Anderson has three solid pitches that can be plus offerings at their best. His 91-94 mph fastball tops out at 96 and generates a lot of groundouts because of its sink and the angle he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame. He has tremendous feel for his slider, a mid-80s weapon with late break that he also can morph into an upper-80s cutter.   Anderson's changeup can be just as effective as his fastball and slider because it sinks and fades and he sells it well with his arm speed. He commands all three offerings and also has a curveball he can mix in to give hitters a different look.

He spent two years in Arizona's system before going to Tampa Bay as part of the Jeremy Hellickson trade in November 2014. He continued his quick rise through the Minors the following year and the finished his 2016 campaign with his first taste of Double-A. Returning to the Southern League in 2017, Williams turned in his best offensive season as he hit for more average and power and tightened his approach. After the season, the Rays added him to their 40-man roster.   Williams began to tap into his raw power in his first Double-A exposure, and that trend continued in '17 in the form of a career-high 14 home runs. It's easy for scouts to forecast even more pop in his future because Williams still produces the majority of his contact on the ground, albeit while effectively using the entire field. With more lift to his swing and improved ability to turn on the ball, Williams could emerge as an annual 20-homer threat.   A shortstop in high school, Williams was quickly moved to the outfield by the D-backs. He's an underrated athlete who moves well and has the tools, including a solid-average arm, to become an adequate corner outfielder. Still scraping the surface of his offensive potential, Williams is seemingly a few adjustments away from putting it all together en route to the Major Leagues.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qBdkDD7U1B4?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""PIT""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2013""","""Terrebonne HS (LA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TBR""","""tb""","""TB""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,50,60,40,45,50,50,55,60,40,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,50,45,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

After leading the Double-A Eastern League with a 2.81 ERA in 2016, he got knocked around in Triple-A last year before a groin injury truncated his season in mid-July.

The quality of his curveball and cutter vary as well, leaving his fading changeup as his best and most consistent secondary offering.  Beede throws a decent amount of strikes but his command isn't as sharp as his control, leaving him more hittable than he should be.

He led the Rookie-level Arizona League in runs (43), triples (six) and total bases (88) during his pro debut, then ranked second in homers (17) and third in walks (65) in the low Class A South Atlantic League at age 19 last year.  If he can make some adjustments at the plate, Lee could have solid or better tools across the board. Though he's not physically imposing at 5-foot-10, the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing give him surprising raw power. He has some feel to hit and a willingness to work counts, though he needs to tone down his aggressiveness after fanning a SAL-high 171 times last year.  With his solid speed, Lee could be a 20-20 player if he refines his basestealing technique after getting caught in 18 of his 38 attempts in 2017.

He raised his OPS 223 points while repeating the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 2017, then stood out as the best player in the Rangers' instructional league program.  Gonzalez has outgrown shortstop, but still has considerable upside as a possible center fielder with solid five-tool ability. With his bat speed, leverage and projectable strength, he has considerable raw power that's only just beginning to show up in games. His long arms naturally add length to this right-handed swing, but he had a noticeably better approach and made better contact last season.

The Phillies never doubted Gamboa's ability and were more than willing to be patient for his considerable tools to start showing up. It didn't help that the start of his 2017 season was delayed by a hamstring injury, but he did start swinging the bat well over the last month and change of the year. He's starting to add strength, with more to come, and that combined with his bat speed should allow him to impact the baseball from both sides of the plate. He makes all the plays at shortstop, where he will be able to play long-term, with a plus arm.    In terms of raw tools, Gamboa rates higher than rookie shortstop J.P.

Though South Atlantic League pitchers took advantage of his ultra-aggressive approach, he rallied to hit .352/.366/.535 in the final six weeks.  Fabian has a feel for hitting well beyond his years, showing the ability to repeatedly barrel balls and make adjustments. He almost puts the bat on the ball too easily, walking in just 3 percent of his plate appearances during his first three pro seasons, and will do more damage once he learns to work counts and not worry about hitting with two strikes. While his hitting ability has more upside than his power, he already shows the potential for average pop and might have more if he turns his right-handed swing loose more often during games.

He has a quality right-handed swing with bat speed and should develop plenty of natural power once he gets stronger and adds some loft to his stroke.  Nevin broke into pro ball at third base but given the organization's depth at the position (beginning with superstar Nolan Arenado), he saw more action at first base in 2017.

The Rays have challenged the young left-hander as a result, jumping him over the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his U.S. debut the next year, and then assigning him to Class A Short Season Hudson Valley to open 2017. He was excellent as a 19-year-old in the New York-Penn League, where he pitched to a .235 ERA with a 0.96 WHIP and a circuit-best .171 opponents' average in 61 1/3 frames.   Linares stands out for his remaining physical projection, as he already shows a fast arm with plenty of room to grow into his 6-foot-2, 170-pound frame.

High. The rawness associated with such a distinction was obvious during his first two seasons, when Whitley appeared behind the talent curve at two lower levels before finishing 2016 on a high note. That success carried over into Whitley's 2017 full-season debut, as he made significant gains in all facets of the game as a member of Class A Bowling Green. Whitley will miss the entire 2018 season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn right labrum.  Whitley's speed is his best tool, grading as a legitimate plus. Meanwhile, after tinkering with his swing for much of '16, Whitley let his tools play in the Midwest League and saw his bat and power blossom as a result. He hit a career-best 13 home runs after totaling just four in his previous 107 games, and did so while maintaining a patient approach and showing better feel to hit. With strength and bat speed from the right side of the plate, he has a chance to hit for both average and power. Whitley's on-base skills remain a strength and make him a threat on the basepaths, where he's swiped 21 bags in back-to-back seasons.   Defensively, Whitley's superb athleticism and wheels give him plenty of range in center field, and he has a better arm than most players at the position. The Rays love his makeup and believe he has both the maturity and mental tools to be successful.

The latter bashed 21 homers (second in NCAA Division I) as a sophomore and 22 (en route to winning Missouri Valley Conference player of the year honors) as a junior last spring, becoming the first Missouri State hitter ever taken in the first round. Signed for $3.7 million, he had little trouble adjusting to low Class A pitching in his pro debut but will miss all of 2018 after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while running out a grounder in Spring Training.  Because he's a stocky right-handed slugger with some arm bar in his swing, Burger draws comparisons to former Chicago third baseman Todd Frazier. With his strength and solid bat speed, he could produce 25 or more homers annually, though he needs to make adjustments to hit more balls in the air after posting a 1.5 groundout/airout ratio in his first taste of pro ball. With his patient approach and ability to make consistent contact, he should hit for average as well as power.  Burger isn't the most graceful athlete but gets the job done in all phases of the game, making him sort of a corner-infield version of Hunter Pence.

After pitching across two levels of A ball in his first season with his new organization, he pitched well in Double-A in 2017, tossing 150 innings and finishing fifth in the system in strikeouts. The Phillies liked what they saw and were happy to add another young, intriguing arm to their deep stable of pitching prospects in the Freddy Galvis trade last December.  The right-hander is capable of using his plus fastball that sits around 94-95 mph and can touch as high as 97-98 mph to both miss bats and get weak contact on the ground, and improved command of the pitch has made it an even better weapon. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, one that flashes plus with good fade to it, but he doesn't throw his curve as effectively.  Given that De los Santos shows glimpses of three at least Major League average pitches to go along with durability, he may be given every chance to start, with a ceiling of a No. 4 type starter.

Targeting offensive upside, the Indians selected Benson, a Duke commit, with the No. 14 overall pick in June, and he made his pro debut later that month after signing for $2.5 million. Spending all of 2017 with Class A Short-Season Mahoning Valley, Benson tied for the New York-Penn League home run lead with 10, while his 36 RBIs ranked third in the circuit.    Benson's combination of bat speed and sheer physical strength translates to prodigious raw power from the left side of the plate, and he's already shown that he can apply it to his pull-side during games. Making consistent contact, however, has been a struggle for Benson, who has struck out one-third of the time in his first two seasons, though he does work his share of walks. The Indians will continue to work with Benson to clean up his swing, with the goal of getting him in a better position to hit.     Benson is an impressive athlete for his size as well as an above-average runner, but he's likely to lose some of that speed with physical maturation. It's also why Benson, a center fielder in high school, is best suited to play right field in pro ball, where he's an average defender with a plus arm. He may be a bit of a project, but all the ingredients are there for Benson to develop into a middle-of-the-order hitter who also adds value with his baserunning and defense.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_oDb1oLoVXU?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""PHI""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2016""","""The Westminster Schools (GA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CLE""","""cle""","""CLE""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,30,65,55,45,80,40,60,70,50,50,80,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,55,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Arias' defensive value gives him a relatively high floor, but it's his entire package on both sides of the ball that has club officials excited about the teenager's bright future.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/QiH28DhFuPI?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2016""","""Venezuela""","""July 2, 2016 - SD""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SDP""","""sd""","""SD""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,20,40,50,45,60,55,45,50,45,55,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,50,60,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He has produced as advertised since signing for $1.4 million as the 31st overall pick, leading the short-season Northwest League with 12 homers in his pro debut and slamming a total of 45 homers in his first two full seasons while advancing to Triple-A. His 24 blasts last year were six more than anyone else hit in the organization in the Majors or Minors.  Shaw's massive 6-foot-4 frame affords him plenty of strength and leverage, allowing him to hit the ball out of the park from foul pole to foul pole. Though he recognizes that his raw power means he doesn't have to swing for the fences, his left-handed swing can get long and he gets in trouble when he expands his strike zone. His whiff rate jumped to a career-worst 29 percent in Triple-A last year and he'll have to develop more patience to hit for average against advanced pitching.  Primarily a right fielder in college, Shaw spent most of his first two pro seasons at first base and worked diligently to become an average defender there. He's blocked by Brandon Belt in San Francisco, however, so he shifted to left field last May.

The performance convinced the Orioles that he was ready for the jump straight to Double-A in 2017, and Mullins validated that assessment with a torrid start in the Eastern League before a pair of hamstring injuries derailed his season.  Mullins boasts an intriguing collection of tools, most notably his plus speed, strong outfield defense and natural hitting ability.

And while Jones' impressive raw power has yet to translate during games, scouts do expect him to develop above-average power as he adds strength to his athletic and highly projectable frame and trims some of the swing-and-miss from his game.    The Indians moved Jones off shortstop, his position as a prep, to third base upon his entering the pro ranks. His size and physicality are clean fits at the hot corner, as are his plus arm strength and average speed, though some evaluators believe his inconsistent glove work will eventually land him in right field. Regardless of his future defensive home, Jones has the bat and offensive ceiling needed to become an impactful everyday player at the highest level.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8MOVqKoFgA?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""CLE""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2016""","""Holy Ghost Prep (PA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CLE""","""cle""","""CLE""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,30,55,30,40,60,40,55,60,30,45,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,55,50,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Surprisingly athletic for a big man, Peters shows average speed out of the batter's box and is faster than that once he gets going.

Full Report:  Gilbert got the attention of Florida area scouts last year when he was regularly in the mid-90's with starter traits, and that carried over to a dominating Cape performance where he sat 92-96 with above average command and off-speed. This spring he started, as many pitchers do, a couple ticks lower but instead of getting back to his old velocity, it continued to slip amid a number of high pitch count outings. Gilbert has taken the ball every week and has performed well, with velocity ranging from 88-91, touching 92 mph in some starts, and sitting 90-94, touching 95 in others, including his last few before regionals.The command, frame and athleticism are stable constants, so he'll still go comfortably in the first round, but there isn't a clear reason for the velo drop. Some scouts are speculating it's a small injury that won't keep him from pitching right now, but shutting him down may bring the velo back next spring. Others think Gilbert would (as many pitchers do) lose a few ticks under a pro workload and become this guy in a few years anyway. Clubs close enough to contention that want immediate pitching help are on Gilbert, like the Mariners, Twins and Angels.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Curveball: 50 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  After a strong sophomore season at Stetson that included Atlantic Sun Conference Pitcher of the Year honors, Gilbert turned in an All-Star showing in the Cape Cod League over the summer. He started out this spring without the same velocity he showed on the Cape, but was still performing well enough to be among the better college pitching options available. As the spring progressed, his fastball started ticking back up.    While Gilbert was sitting in the mid-90s and touching 97 mph over the summer, he was pitching more in the 91-92 mph range and touching 94 mph early on, though was creeping back toward the mid-90s late in the spring. At times his two breaking balls can blend together, but his slider is better than his slow ""get me over"" curveball. His changeup might be his best pitch, though some scouts would like to see him use it more frequently. His arm and delivery works well and he throws strikes.    Stetson has never had a pitcher taken in the first round, though Corey Kluber and Jacob deGrom did cut their teeth at the school. Despite the slight dip in velocity early, Gilbert still is a safe bet to beat those two right-handers, who went in the fourth and ninth rounds, easily.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l0Jw6egZzJg?autoplay=1""","""|""","""LAN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""SEA""",14,,,,"""|""","""Stetson""","""""","""Stetson""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",1,0,0,1,"""|""","""+""","""+""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,55,50,55,,,,50

Escobar has an exciting three-pitch mix; it's just a question of him knowing where any of them might be going in any given start. He'll throw his live fastball up to 95-96 mph with ease.

As a teenager in the NYPL, Myers showed feel for locating a fastball that sat 93-96 mph with late movement. He throws his curveball with tight spin that gives it late downer action, and scouts believe it could be a plus pitch once fully developed. Myers also has an advanced changeup relative to his age and experience, giving the young righty three solid offerings that should allow him to stick as a starter. He's athletic and repeats both his delivery and arm action well, and club officials have already been impressed with his capacity for making mechanical adjustments.

Full Report:  Casas has a long track record of production at showcases and with multiple Team USA clubs, but has been hard to scout this spring as he's a patient, famous hitter that's been pitched around. In the past, this has happened to hitters like Jason Heyward and Braxton Davidson. Casas was a 2019 prospect that reclassified to the 2018 class where he's now of roughly of average age for the class. He's appealed mostly to more analytical teams due to his track record of hitting and the big exit velos he posts, due to his power and fly ball-oriented swing. Casas' cut is designed to tap into his top-of-the-scale raw power and he often does, when he swings.He plays third base now and has a 55 arm that gets into the low 90's on the mound, but he's limited athletically and laterally, fitting at first base only long-term. Some clubs see Casas' mature approach and see a 6 hit, 6 or 7 power future monster that is the rare high school first baseman worth a first round pick while others see a fringy hitter that sells out for power and beats up on non pro-level pitching. There's enough interest that Casas could go as high as 13 and likely finds a spot in the top 30-35 picks.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 55 | Run: 40 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50    Casas is one of the streakier hitters in the Draft class, and he was on fire while playing for the U.S. National 18-and-under team in international competition. The corner infielder was the MVP of the World Baseball Softball Confederation U-18 Baseball World Cup, helping Team USA win a gold medal by leading the tournament in home runs and RBIs. He was named the WBSC International Baseball Player of the Year for his efforts.    Casas is all about his bat and the power he can produce with it. In terms of raw pop, he's up there with just about anyone in the class, registering high exit velocities at various times. The only question is whether he'll make enough contact to tap into that power consistently, as there are some holes in his swing. He loves to hit and does have an approach at the plate, something he'll have to continue to refine at the next level.    While Casas is more agile than you'd think, plays third base at American Heritage with an arm that was up to 92 mph off the mound, and has worked hard to tone up his body, he will likely be a first baseman only in the future. How much a team believes Casas will hit will determine his Draft status and if he is taken early enough to walk away from the University of Miami.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/900T_ozI7iY?autoplay=1""","""|""","""BOS""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""BOS""",26,,,,"""|""","""American Heritage HS FL""","""Miami""","""American Heritage (Fla.)

Full Report:  Rocker was a famous name in this class as a sophomore in high school when his loose, quick arm was running his fastball into the mid-90's. Since then, Rocker has filled out considerably at roughly 6'5/250, taking after his father Tracy, a former NFL defensive tackle who is the defensive line coach for Tennessee. Rocker topped out at 99 mph over the summer and has been considered a first round pick for years, but had his worst outing of the spring in his last outing, losing a playoff matchip to Cole Wilcox. At his best this spring, Rocker would sit 93-96, hitting 98 mph with a hellacious two-plane slider that was a 65 or 70 pitch for most scouts. His changeup wasn't needed much but flashed average at times and his command was average with control a hair better than that, though some scouts don't love his mechanics.The questions on Rocker were 1) maintaining his current physique 2) maintaining his athleticism to repeat his delivery and stay a starter and 3) having enough feel to pitch and deception to flourish when he doesn't have his premium stuff. Rocker was often pitching on a week or more of rest this spring, so scouts didn't see diminished stuff until the Wilcox outing, when Rocker was sitting mostly 90-93 mph, dipping into the high 80's in the 4th inning with a breaking ball that was a 50 or 55. His command wasn't as good that day and Rocker was hit around some, visibly frustrated. Granted that was one outing, but it could be considered a concern about a prep pitcher with no physical projection that will likely lose a tick or two of velocity as he matures.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 70 | Slider: 60 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  The son of former NFL defensive lineman Tracy Rocker, Kumar also has a football build that has prompted physical comparisons to seven-time All-Star Lee Smith. He opened last summer as the consensus top high school pitching prospect before getting passed by fellow Georgia product Ethan Hankins. Cole Wilcox has passed them both among Peach State prepsters this spring, and while Rocker won't be the first prep arm selected, he still could fit somewhere in the back half of the first round.  Rocker usually pitches at 92-96 mph with his fastball and can reach 98, showing hard sink on occasion and generally commanding it well. There are times when his heater gets hit harder than expected, usually when it straightens out and he leaves it up in the zone. His shoulder opens early at times, giving batters a good look at his fastball, but he's athletic enough to adjust his delivery and hide the ball better.  Rocker generates power with a quick arm and little effort, something that's also evident when he snaps off a wipeout slider in the mid-80s. It needs more consistency, as does a changeup that should become at least average, but he has all the makings of a quality three-pitch repertoire. He's part of a loaded Vanderbilt recruiting class that also includes Hankins.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9ljeJlzB5A?autoplay=1""","""|""","""LAN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""","""North Oconee HS GA""","""Vanderbilt""","""North Oconee (Ga.)

He pitched to mixed results out of the bullpen during his first taste of Double-A in his second full season but made progress in his return to the level in 2017, turning in 24 strong starts for Bowie en route to Eastern League mid-season All-Star honors as well as a trip to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game in July. The Orioles ultimately rewarded Scott with a September callup, allowing the hard-throwing lefty to get his feet wet in the big leagues with a pair of relief appearances.  Scott's elite fastball gives him closer potential, as he'll routinely hit triple digits while sitting comfortably at 97-99 mph. His low-90s slider has improved to where it's an above-average pitch, and its combination of sheer velocity and late break helps Scott pile up whiffs on both sides of the plate. His changeup represents a distant third pitch, one he threw sparingly even when working as a starter in 2017. The Orioles have worked with Scott to simplify his delivery to improve his strike-throwing ability, though realistically, his control might never be better than below average.  With his big fastball from the left side and a knack for missing bats and avoiding barrels, Scott possesses obvious upside as a late-inning reliever. The Orioles held him to a strict three-inning limit as a starter in 2017, believing that the extra reps would yield better control and improved durability, and it wouldn't be a surprise if they managed his workload similarly in 2018. That said, Scott must make serious gains with both his control and command to avoid a permanent move to the bullpen.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dSTn-yI8hfw?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""6th rd 2014""","""Howard JC (TX)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""BAL""","""bal""","""BAL""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",80,40,,55,,,,30,80,45,,60,,,,40,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",80,40,,55,,,,40

Some see the soft body as a problem, others see reverse projection and a chance to stay in CF if he slims down.    Full Report:  Jenista has a somewhat unusual combination of frame and tools for a first round hitter. At 6'4/240, normally prospects of that size have real issues with athleticism, defense, and offensive limitations, and go outside of the top few rounds. The difference is that Jenista has plus athleticism for his size, turning in average run times and playing some center field for Wichita State. He also plays some first base but fits best in pro ball in right field, where his 55 arm plays. At the plate, Jenista is something like a post-peak Adam Dunn or Lance Berkman, with patience and also some wild swings and misses early in the count, but 65-grade raw power that can punish mistakes. Jenista also has a more flat-planed swing that is ripe for a loft-inducing tweak.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 55 | Run: 55 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 50  Jenista was the most improved Cape Cod League player from 2016 to 2017, improving his batting line from .229/.301/.321 to .310/.391/.401. He also won the prestigious summer circuit's MVP award and established himself as having one of the best combinations of physicality and athleticism among college position players in the 2018 Draft. He and Alec Bohm had a chance to double the number of Wichita State hitters ever selected in the first round, following Joe Carter (1981) and Casey Gillaspie (2014), though Jenista's up-and-down junior season likely will knock him down to the second.  Jenista has exceptional hand-eye coordination, allowing him to repeatedly barrel balls even though he still can get fooled by breaking balls. His left-handed swing presently is geared more to line drives, but his size and strength create plenty of raw power that's more obvious during batting practice than in games. He's a patient hitter who's not afraid to work deep counts and will take walks when he's pitched around.  For a 6-foot-4, 220-pounder, Jenista has a surprisingly broad base of tools. He focused on getting in better shape in 2017, improving his speed to above average and looking surprisingly efficient while playing center field on the Cape. He has played mostly first base and right field for the Shockers, has a solid arm and profiles best at the latter position.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/v7_ASPpiKVo?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""","""ATL""",49,,,,"""|""","""Wichita State""","""""","""Wichita State""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""","""+""","""-""","""-""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,55,55,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

It also showed the world what the Mets have known about the infielder since they signed him for $200,000 in the 10th round out of the Florida high school ranks: He has perhaps the best hands in the Minor Leagues.  After a successful 2017 campaign in his first taste of Double-A, there remains no doubt Guillorme will be a big leaguer. His defense alone will get him there. Despite average speed, at best, Guillorme is a plus defender at shortstop and might be an 80 defender at second. His arm might only be a tick above-average, but his instincts are off the charts and he has incredibly quick hands that allow him to make every play imaginable. At the plate, Guillorme has the contact skills and strike zone recognition, he walked more than he struck out in 2017, to be a plus hitter. But he lacks strength, with just two career homers in over 1,700 at-bats, and the question remains if he can impact the ball enough to be a big league regular offensively.   Guillorme played a lot of second base and even a little third last year to be comfortable at those positions. He'll primarily be at shortstop in 2018, but will get some time at the other spots in case he's needed, especially with Amed Rosario entrenched at short in New York.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/BgaLpYSnLbQ?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""10th rd 2013""","""Coral Springs Charter HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""NYM""","""nym""","""NYM""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",45,20,45,45,70,60,55,20,45,45,70,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,20,45,55,70,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The Twins swooped in and signed Severino for $2.5 million.  While the Braves moved Severino to second base immediately upon the start of his career, the Twins feel he has the chance to stay at shortstop, with an above-average arm and good hands. In the end, it will be his ultimate size and range which will determine his position. If he ends up truly filling out, he likely ends at second, but probably outperforms his current power grade. If he doesn't, he's an offensive-minded shortstop with fringy power. He's still quite raw and needs to develop more of an approach at the plate, but the switch-hitter can drive the ball to all fields.

Full Report:  A staple on the travel ball circuit for several years, Edwards has a long track record of performance against high-level pitching and his elite speed makes it likely that he plays a premium defensive position in pro ball, and plays it well. Like Madrigal, Edwards faces questions about his size, but power isn't part of his game and doesn't project to be. Instead, Edwards is a high-effort offensive catalyst who knifes at defenses with line drives and well-placed bunts. If you were picking teams for a schoolyard game among this year's high school crop, Edwards goes first. He's got a puncher's chance to come off the board before pick 15 and probably doesn't get out of the early 20's.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 70 | Arm: 50 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50    The home run ball returned with a vengeance in Major League Baseball in 2017, but that doesn't mean teams aren't still in need of the table-setters to get on base and run in front of the slugging run producers. When a hitter like Edwards also plays up the middle defensively, teams are definitely going to sit up and pay attention.    While he is a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, Edwards' performance over the summer and into his senior season had many evaluators looking past that. His speed is his best tool, an easy plus that allows him to get down the line in a hurry from both sides of the plate and be a basestealing threat. He has a contact-oriented approach and uses all fields well, and while he's not likely to be a home run threat, he could grow into his frame for more extra-base pop with an Eric Young type of build. He has excellent actions and footwork at shortstop and has shown he has enough arm to stay on the left side of the infield.    Assuming teams can look past his size, the one other hurdle might be his commitment to Vanderbilt. Edwards is a good student whose parents are educators, so he'll have to go early enough to bypass college, a distinct possibility.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/tuFOx2A8XHw?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""","""SD""",38,,,,"""|""","""North Broward Prep HS FL""","""Vanderbilt""","""North Broward (Fla.)

But Rogers never took the mound after signing, as the Marlins opted to give him additional rest, while Hurricane Irma wiped out his chances of pitching in Miami's fall instructional league.    Rogers features an impressive fastball, one capable of reaching of the mid-90s but typically sits more in the low 90s. His heater plays up because of his long arms, deception and very good command of the pitch. The southpaw's secondary stuff is well behind his fastball, as Rogers will throw a slider and a curveball that tend to bleed together, with the former currently ahead of the latter. He has trouble staying on top of his curve, and some scouts believe he will likely be better off sticking to the slider at the next level. He also throws a changeup that is getting better and approaching average.    Already plenty athletic with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery, the Marlins believe Rogers is just scratching the surface of his physical potential.

There is little question Chisholm can stay at shortstop, with good hands and actions to go along with enough arm for the premium position.

An advanced hitter with a nice right-handed swing, Jackson already uses the whole field and manages the strike zone. His quick bat and wiry strength could translate into 15 or more homers per season, and he's showing the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field this spring. The Mississippi State recruit isn't particularly fast out of the batter's box but he's an average runner who flashes solid speed once he gets underway and takes longer strides.  Jackson has the athleticism and actions to play shortstop, but his lack of a quick first step leads most scouts to believe he'll eventually wind up at second base. His solid arm strength works at shortstop and would be an asset turning double plays at second. If he has to move to the other side of the bag, he has the tools to still profile well offensively.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7Gf--7lf_pk?autoplay=1""","""|""","""TOR""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""LAA""",57,,,,"""|""","""St. Luke's Episcopal HS AL""","""Mississippi State""","""St. Luke's Episcopal (Ala.)

This spring, he repeatedly has topped out at 97 or 98 mph.  Rodriguez's fastball sits at 92-94 mph with heavy life that should turn wood bats into kindling. He has an array of promising secondary pitches, with most scouts preferring his low-80s slider to his mid-70s curveball, though the latter has nice shape. He hasn't had much need for a changeup but shows the potential to have an average one.  Rodriguez is a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that allows him to provide strikes on a regular basis.

Full Report:  Siani is a vocal leader and polished defensive center fielder with an accurate, plus arm. He's had a disappointing spring, from an offensive standpoint, especially as it relates to power and the quality of his BP's. As the draft approaches there's some buzz that his stock may have fallen to the point where he's a signability risk in round two. His contact skills and ability to play center give him a relatively high floor as a prospect, but his lack of power and age have some teams off of him. ""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 60 | Overall: 50    As an outfielder from the Northeast high school ranks, Siani understandably looks up to Mike Trout. While comparing him to the former New Jersey prep standout would be unfair, the Philadelphia-area raised Siani does have the chance to be a toolsy performer who sticks in center field at the next level.    A two-time member and gold-medal winner of USA Baseball's 18-and-under national team, Siani currently has some tools that grade out as plus right now. He has a plus arm that has delivered 90-plus mph throws from the outfield consistently. He has plus speed to go along with outstanding instincts that make him one of the best defensive outfielders in the Draft class, one who will no doubt play center field long term. His speed makes him a threat on the basepaths. There's a lot to work with at the plate as well, though Siani's skills are more raw than fully formed. There is a good amount of raw power from the left side of the plate that he should grow into, though that will only be if he hits enough to tap into it consistently, a concern of some scouts.    Should Siani go on to the University of Virginia, he'd likely get the chance to play both ways, where his left arm delivers low-90s fastballs from the mound. At the pro level, he's an outfielder only, and a team confident in his bat is liable to take him early enough to sign him.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KlYz5jJqWSI?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""","""CIN""",109,,,,"""|""","""William Penn Charter HS PA""","""Virginia""","""William Penn (Pa.)

His defensive game is a bit behind his bat, outside of his arm, which is a plus tool that helps control a running game.

As the summer wore on, Seigler was chosen as the backup catcher for Team USA and quickly took the starting job from fellow Georgia prep catcher, Will Banfield, due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. This spring he's steadily moved up boards, into the late first round area, because Seigler has been putting the bat on the ball and lifting it in games against top Georgia high school competition. Seigler is an average runner with an awkward gait, but even if he loses a step as he ages he'll still be an above-average athlete for the position. Some teams don't like the horrendous track record of prep catchers and have considered moving Seigler to an infield spot in pro ball, but most would not since he's already so advanced, defensively. His plus arm and active framing and receiving reminds some of M.J. Melendez from last year's draft, but Seigler is more advanced offensively, though a bit less twitchy. The Royals took Melendez last year and are the most interested team in Seigler, along with the Dodgers (who love multi-positional, athletic catchers), Braves and D'Backs. Seigler's mother is Navajo. He'd be the first Native American big leaguer to debut since Joba Chamberlain and second ever Navajo, joining Jacoby Ellsbury.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 40 | Run: 45 | Arm: 55 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50  Seigler has gained notoriety as a switch-throwing pitcher who can throw in the upper 80s and is equally effective with either arm. He also switch-hits and is proficient from both sides of the plate, but his ambidextrousness shouldn't overshadow the fact that he's one of the best all-around catchers in the Draft. He could be the first high school backstop selected, perhaps even in the late first round.  Fellow Georgia prep product Will Banfield has louder defensive tools, but Seigler is solid behind the plate, a better hitter and played ahead of him on the U.S. national team that won the 18-and-under World Cup last September. He's agile behind the plate, has a quick transfer that helps his arm play as plus at times and shows promise as a receiver and pitch framer. He's more athletic than most catchers, along the lines of Austin Barnes, and could profile as an everyday second baseman as well.  Seigler makes consistent hard contact from both sides of the plate and employs an all-fields approach. There's some question as to how much power he'll have, but he has solid bat speed and should provide at least double-digit home run production once he gets stronger. The Florida recruit has close to average speed, making him quick for a catcher, and shows good instincts in all phases of the game.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Pygpv-Fofq?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""","""NYY""",23,,,,"""|""","""Cartersville HS GA""","""Florida""","""Cartersville (Ga.)

He emerged as the Rebels' most reliable starter in the second half of his 2017 freshman season and starred in the Cape Cod League during the summer, putting himself in position to join Drew Pomeranz as the only players in school history to go in the first round. He has maintained that status despite being a little inconsistent this spring.  Rolison has one of the best curveballs in the Draft, a sharp breaker with power and depth. He works in the low 90s with his fastball, can hit 95 mph when he needs to and locates his heater to either side of the plate. He also mixes in a slider with some tilt and a changeup with some fade.  Add in his athleticism, strong build and easy delivery, and Rolison has everything he needs to remain a starter at the next level. His stuff and his control have improved in each of the last two years, and he may not be done getting better.

The problems persisted that summer and into 2016, limiting the talented outfielder to just 236 at-bats over two summers. In 2017 he avoided leg injuries, but an elbow problem ended his season in July with ulnar nerve surgery.  The good news is that despite all the missed time, Lindsay still shows solid tools at the plate. Trouble seeing the ball led to a rough start during his first taste of full-season ball in 2017, but after that was addressed with a new prescription, he started to hit for average and power before his season ended. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks, albeit with a fairly high strikeout rate, though that improved with the sight adjustment. He still runs well, despite the leg issues, and while he was hesitant because of the injuries, he might get the green light more moving forward on the basepaths and it allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field. His arm is fine for center, but he'd likely have to move to left should he slow down.  The first order of business is for Lindsay to get a full season of reps in on both sides of the ball so he can continue refining his approach at the plate as well as his reads and routes in the outfield. If he can do that, then it might be easier to project his upside.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/akUuQZG6dnk?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""STL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2015""","""Out of Door Academy HS (FL)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""NYM""","""nym""","""NYM""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,30,60,60,30,50,45,50,60,55,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,60,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He ended up sliding a bit to the second round after a bit of a velocity dip during his senior season combined with his commitment to LSU. The Twins used their bonus pool wisely and had $2 million, more than twice pick value, to sign him and he had a strong, albeit brief, debut in the Gulf Coast League.  Armed with a strong three-pitch mix and the ability to throw all of it for strikes, one of the biggest things Enlow needed to do was add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame and show he could maintain velocity throughout starts and through a season. Once listed at 170 pounds, Enlow was up over 190 thanks to strength and conditioning efforts during the offseason. That should help him keep his fastball at least in the low-90s consistently and make the times he touches 94-95 mph much more frequent. His curve ball is the pitch that separates him from other young arms, perhaps, a true 12-to-6 power breaking ball. He hasn't needed his changeup a ton in the past, but he has good feel for it.

The Nationals, intrigued by Johnson's loud tools and breakout performance, gave him $325,000 as their fifth-round pick in the 2016 Draft.

Johnson's physical strength and lightning-quick bat speed help him to generate plus raw power from the left side of the plate, and he surprised with his ability to get to it consistently during games in 2017. Improved plate discipline and pitch recognition, along with better feel for using the entire field, gives Johnson a chance to hit for average, but he will always have some swing-and-miss to his game and will need figure out left-handed pitching. Johnson also knows how to impact games on the basepaths with his plus speed, though his basestealing technique leaves something to be desired.   The Nationals were pleased with Johnson's defensive strides in 2017 and believe he has a non-zero chance of sticking in center field. He's also seen considerable playing time in right field, and some evaluators think that will be his long-term home on account of his cannon arm.

Full Report:  Scott was a big name as a freshman at Plant High School as he was the spitting image of teammate and eventual #5 overall pick Kyle Tucker, with a lanky frame and loose, gloveless, lefty swing. Scott is a superior athlete to Tucker, as Scott has been into the mid-90's on the mound with three average or better pitches and 70 speed that profiles in center field. Scott doesn't appear to like pitching so scouts haven't seen him throw much, but he's easily a top-5 round prospect on the hill. While he's played in some high-profile prep games around Tampa (mostly for scouts who are based in the area), Scott only went to a few national events this summer.This, combined with a number of minor spring injuries (hamstring and concussion the most notable) have made Scott hard for decision makers to see, and thus slid him down around the 20's rather than around 10, where his tools belong alongside Kelenic and Gorman at the top of the class. Some scouts that got positive preseason looks predicted Scott would be this year's Austin Beck and shoot into the top 10 picks, but that likely won't happen.

More recently, it produced outfielder Kyle Tucker, who went No. 5 in the 2015 Draft to the Astros and is one of the top prospects in baseball. Scott gets some comps to his former Plant outfield mate, albeit with less power and more speed.    Scott does have the makings of a five-tool player. Currently, his standout tool is his speed, which he uses to get down the line in a hurry and run down balls in center field. He has really good hands to hit and some feel the 6-foot-4 left-handed hitter will add power once he starts incorporating his lower half more consistently. He can defend in the outfield to go along with a plus arm.    Committed to the University of Florida, Scott does have a backup plan on the mound, with a fastball up to 93 mph and a decent curve from the left side. But his tools on both sides of the ball as an outfielder should have him in play in the early going, and he was firmly in first-round conversations despite missing time with a hamstring injury.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0xcsCdAtkPM?autoplay=1""","""|""","""MIN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""","""MIA""",13,,,,"""|""","""Plant HS FL""","""Florida""","""Plant (Fla.)

Though known best for his robust left-handed raw power, Naylor has stood out more for his hitting ability early in his career. The Ontario native makes hard contact to all fields thanks to his plus bat speed and excellent hand-eye coordination, all while keeping his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time. Naylor tightened his approach in 2017 and as a result had both his strikeout and walk rates move in positive directions. However, it's that same approach that can make Naylor too passive at the plate and fuel the pitch-selection issues that prevent him from getting to his power during games.  Naylor is short and stocky but also a good athlete for his size, with surprising, albeit below-average, speed. He's made strides with his defense at first base but still profiles as a below-average defender there.

He displayed all-fields power and a chance to stay at short, especially for a growing amount of teams who are more inclusive about who they consider a viable shortstop because of newer methods of defensive positioning.

Eierman's bat speed and strength create natural power from the right side of the plate, but he has sold out for home runs this spring with negative results.

When healthy, Garcia has a fastball-slider combination that is good enough to compete with at the Major League level. He throws his fastball up to 95-96 mph regularly and his breaking ball will flash plus, missing bats to the tune of a 12.8 K/9 rate in 2017. The Tigers have encouraged him to work on his changeup more, a serviceable pitch now that could be average and give him a legitimate third weapon. With the exception of his time in Triple-A, he was generally around the strike zone with enough command to succeed in late relief.  Garcia's bulldog mentality is well-suited for relief work and he likes getting the ball late in games.

Though slightly undersized, Gonzalez is loaded with arm strength. He operates at 93-95 mph with his fastball but can reach back for 96-97, all while pitching to both sides of the plate.

Jake missed most of his draft spring with a broken wrist and just returned last week. Multiple scouts told us he looked so rusty he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft. At his best, McCarthy shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit and a center field profile.Unforunately, he's barely had a chance to show that this spring and he was used irregularly from Team USA in the summer. Most teams' top scouts only scout players the 12 months of their eligible year, so teams with more history will lean on that to evaluate McCarthy. In addition to this, Virginia has geared his swing for opposite field liners and groundballs, along with having him bunt early in games batting near the top of the lineup. There's likely a swing change needed in pro ball, adding another 'if' to McCarthy's situation.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 45 | Field: 55 | Overall: 50    In 2015, Joe McCarthy was drafted out of the University of Virginia in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft by the Rays. Now it's his younger brother's turn. While Joe is a pure-hitting corner outfielder/first baseman, Jake is a fleet-footed center fielder whose Draft stock initially took a hit when a broken wrist forced him out of action for much of his junior season&#184; though a healthy return to action had him headed back up boards as the Draft approached.  McCarthy moved into the starting lineup as a sophomore and promptly hit .338 with a .425 on-base percentage and an ACC-leading 27 steals in 29 attempts. While he didn't hit well playing for Team USA over the summer, he did find his footing with a solid late stretch in the Cape Cod League. Some scouts aren't in love with his swing, which features a flat bat path, but others point to a pretty good track record of making consistent hard contact. He hasn't hit for much power to speak of, but some changes to his mechanics could allow him to tap into his raw pop at the next level. He has a fringy arm, but has the speed and instincts to play center field.    There are some evaluators who see McCarthy as a Jacoby Ellsbury type while others think he's similar offensively to 2017 first-rounder Adam Haseley.

Dubon made additional strides in his first season as a Brewer, splitting the year between Double-A Biloxi and Triple-A Colorado Springs while representing the World Team in the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game along the way. In the wake of Dubon's strong season, the Brewers added him to their 40-man roster in November.    Dubon can do a little bit of everything on the diamond. At the dish, he exhibits excellent hand-eye coordination and a quick right-handed bat, allowing him to generate barreled, line-drive contact with relative ease. Those qualities along with his solid approach lead scouts to project him as at least an average hitter. Dubon also has had his power tick up as he's grown stronger, and it's resulted in improved home-run totals in each of his five seasons and a career-high eight in 2017. However, hitting for consistent power will never be a part of his game, and he's more likely to be a source of doubles and triples. Dubon's extra-base-hit totals are also a product of the plus speed that has netted him at least 30 steals in three straight seasons.    Dubon is a true middle infielder, one with quick hands and feet as well as the arm strength to make plays from either side of the bag. He split time in 2017 between both shortstop and second base, showing well at both spots, and it's fair to think he'll be able to play whatever position the Brewers ask of him.

After a solid summer debut, the Mets sent Dunn straight to the Class A Advanced Florida State League for his first full season and he struggled a bit there, finishing the final month of the season on the disabled list.  Pure stuff-wise, Dunn was just fine with St. Lucie. His fastball was consistently in the 93-95 mph range and he was able to reach back for more on occasion. His slider can serve as a true out pitch, flashing plus with good late bite. As a reliever, he hadn't worked on his changeup much, and it's behind the other two pitches, but he does show feel for it. He'll need it to get lefties out, something he struggled with last year. Dunn is athletic and repeats his delivery fairly well, but he had command and control issues throughout 2017.  A certain learning curve was to be expected, given Dunn's lack of starting experience, though being shut down at the end of his first season didn't help quiet detractors who worried about his size and durability. He still has the stuff to start and has the chance to wipe the slate clean.

One of the youngest players in the 2017 Draft class, he has considerable offensive upside. With bat speed and strength, Vientos has the chance to hit for average and power and the pop that wasn't there consistently during his senior year, showed up in the GCL. There can be some swing and miss, but when he got hot in August, his strikeout rate plummeted. Though he has below-average speed and lacks range, his arm and hands make him a better shortstop than expected, though most see a full-time move to third in his future.  Vientos played both spots on the left side of the infield during his debut and the good news is it looks like his bat will profile just fine at the hot corner should that become his permanent home.

That's why the Braves are downright giddy about Davidson, a 2016 19th-round pick out of Midland Junior College, after a big first full season.    Davidson began the year pitching out of Rome's bullpen in the South Atlantic League and his stuff looked good in that role, with a fastball up to 97 mph and a solid breaking ball. In June, the Braves wanted to see what he would be like in a starting role and it turned out to look pretty good, as the southpaw posted a 2.76 ERA over 12 starts. His fastball was still in the 92-95 mph range and while he sacrificed a few strikeouts, he had a very strong ground-ball rate. His curve could be a plus pitch in time and he showed some feel for his changeup, though it's behind the other two pitches, and he threw a lot of strikes with all three offerings.

He emerged as one of the more promising young hurlers in the low Minors two years later, garnering All-Star honors with Class A Wisconsin en route to a promotion to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in July. Diplan struggled in 2017 in his return to the that level, as he once again showed promising stuff, but also less feel for it than he did the previous year.    An undersized right-hander with an electric arm, Diplan pitches with a fastball that sits 92-96 mph with late movement and at times scrapes a few ticks higher. He complements his heater with a plus slider, and he has surprisingly advanced feel for throwing a changeup. Having previously shown solid control of his three-pitch mix, Diplan regressed with his strike-throwing ability and overall feel for pitching in 2017. He still missed his share of bats, but also issued 71 walks -- second most in the Carolina League -- over 125 2/3 innings to finish with career-worst walks-per-nine rate of 5.08.    Diplan's struggles in 2017 were a product of inconsistent mechanics, as he all too often failed to stay on line with the plate and repeat his delivery. Club officials believe those issues were tied to his physical development, and the hope is that he'll get back on track once he better understands the limitations of his more physically mature frame. Diplan still has a chance to reach his ceiling as No. 3 or 4 starter if he can do so, though a move to bullpen appears increasingly likely.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/FoG4Cw6p5B0?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2013""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 2, 2013 - TEX""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIL""","""mil""","""MIL""","""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,40,,55,,,,40,60,50,,60,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,45,,60,,,,40

He put it all together during his 2017 full-season debut, beginning the year with Class A Lansing before advancing to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in August. Altogether, the toolsy outfielder led all Blue Jays farmhands in both runs scored (93) and triples (10) while finishing second in home runs (17) and third in RBIs (72). Olivares' performance caught the attention of the Padres, and they acquired him and reliever Jared Carkuff for Yangervis Solarte in January.  Wiry and athletic, Olivares stands out as much for his remaining physical projection as he does for his present athleticism and tools. He combines bat speed with a short right-handed swing to produce lots of hard contact, generating good extension through the ball and driving it to all fields. He began to tap into his above-average raw power and cleared fences more regularly in 2017, and scouts believe there'll be more power to come once he adds strength to his lean frame and better learns to leverage his swing.  Olivares knows how to use his well above-average speed on the basepaths as well as in the outfield, where he possesses the necessary range for all three positions and a strong enough arm to play right.

Targeting Franklin's high ceiling while also recognizing that he might be a bit of a project, the Rays made him their third-round pick that June and then signed him for $597,500. Eased into the professional ranks as the Rays often do with their young hurlers, Franklin impressed during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and built upon that performance in 2017 while helping to pace Class A Short Season Hudson Valley to a New York-Penn League title.   Franklin is physically mature for his age, with a body that's built for starting games but also requires further projection. A good athlete with a clean arm action, he's been clocked up to 95 mph with his fastball and sits comfortably in the low 90s with heavy sink, and scouts like his chances of adding more velocity.

Full Report:  This spring, Wilcox surprised scouts who were not expecting him to be such a polished, zone-pounding pitcher. Wilcox is a good athlete who repeats his (non-traditional) delivery and has plus control, but you can't project his stuff to improve much because his frame is maxed out. On the bright side, his stuff is already plenty good, sitting 92-94 with above average life most days, and running up to 98 mph in a heavily-scouted playoff matchup with Kumar Rocker that Wilcox ended up winning. Wilcox also has a nasty, plus changeup that he'll use even against poor prep hitters that can't catch up to his fastball, and his changeup moves so much they still can't hit it. His slider was an above average to plus pitch in the summer and, with a slightly different grip this spring, the pitch has been more average to slightly above. It's still effective against right handed hitters. Wilcox will need a slight delivery adjustment to fix his direction to the plate but otherwise, along with Cole Winn, offers something close to a finished product that just needs to make small improvements. Some scouts pick apart Wilcox's delivery and arm action but there's some cognitive dissonance there as both are better than Casey Mize's and Wilcox, right now, looks something like what Mize looked like a year ago. There's plenty of teams showing lots of interest in the 10-20 range and the rumored $3 million price tag will likely be met.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Slider: 55 | Changeup: 60 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50  Ethan Hankins and Kumar Rocker were the marquee names among Georgia high school pitchers entering the year, but Wilcox joined them on the Team USA pitching staff that won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup last September and has surpassed them both this spring. He outclassed Rocker and even homered off him in a state 4-A playoff game in May, cementing his place in the first round. He has the best chance of the trio of developing three solid pitches.  Wilcox's fastball already sits at 92-95 mph and reaches 98 with heavy sink and the promise of more velocity once he fills out his athletic 6-foot-5 frame. His 82-87 mph changeup is equally effective, featuring fading action and often bottoming out at the plate. He'll also unleash a plus slider at 82-85 mph, though it's not quite as consistent as his other two offerings.  Wilcox repeats his mechanics well and has advanced feel for pitching. His delivery and arm action aren't as smooth as those of Hankins and Rocker, but his stuff is so good he has won over teams leery of taking high school pitchers in the first round. If he follows through on his commitment to Georgia, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2020.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mUKE04zP5UU?autoplay=1""","""|""","""BAL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""","""Heritage HS GA""","""Georgia""","""Heritage (Ga.)

He rebounded in his return to the Class A Peoria the following year, when he finished ninth in the Midwest League in batting average and tied for third in stolen bases. Sierra built on that success in 2017, beginning the season in the Class A Advanced Florida State League before jumping to the Major Leagues in May. He ultimately batted .317 over parts of 22 games (and four stints) with St. Louis, which then dealt him to the Marlins in December with Sandy Alcantara, Zac Gallen and Daniel Castano as part of the Marcell Ozuna trade.    With his knack for making consistent, hard contact and his well-above-average speed, Sierra has the raw ingredients to become a future top-of-the-order-type hitter, and he stands to solidify that profile even more with a more refined approach and improved on-base skills. Sierra will never offer over-the-fence power but has enough strength to hit the gaps, with his speed enabling to him to routinely take extra bases. He receives high marks for his baserunning, though his ability as a basestealer leaves something to be desired. Sierra is an elite-level defender in center field, the kind who regularly makes highlight-reel plays, and he has a plus arm to boot.    While he doesn't have the ceiling of Miami's other recently acquired outfielders like Lewis Brinson and Monte Harrison, Sierra, with his four average-or-better tools, certainly has the highest floor.

Although his progress stalled a bit in 2017 due to a two-month stint on the disabled list for broken hamate bone in his right hand, Allen still made his Major League debut in September and impressed enough to land a spot on the Tribe's postseason roster.   The switch-hitting Allen has everything teams covet in a potential top-of-the-order hitter, as he consistently puts the ball in play from both sides of the plate, shows an advanced approach with strong on-base skills and knows how to utilize his plus speed once on base. And while he has well-below-average power, Allen does show occasional pop from the left side. A Minor League Gold Glove Award winner in 2016, Allen is a gifted defender in center field with range for days and solid arm strength.   Currently blocked by Bradley Zimmer in center field, Allen's clearest path to playing time in Cleveland could come at an outfield corner.

It's not that Fernandez was awful in Palm Beach in 2017; he just didn't dominate the way someone with his premium stuff should, and he was shut down at the end of July with some arm tenderness as the Cardinals decided to err on the side of caution. He still has one of the best fastballs in the system, one that reaches 99 mph, and he can combine it with a changeup that flashes plus. Two things holding Fernandez back are his lack of a consistent slider and a lack of command. His breaking ball is developing, but it's fringe-average at best right now, and he'll predictably rely on his fastball-changeup combination to get outs when he needs to. His control comes and goes, leading to elevated walk rates, while his lack of feel for pitching hasn't allowed him to miss as many bats as he should.  Fernandez will pitch all of 2018 at age 21, so there is time for him to turn his projection into performance. There's a chance he ends up in the bullpen, but he'll continue to start to work on all of his pitches and get more innings.""",,,,,"""|""","""PHI""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2014""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 2, 2014 - STL""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""STL""","""stl""","""STL""","""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,60,,40,,,,40,60,70,,45,,,,50,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,55,,45,,,,45

Suarez has always had a very strong feel for pitching, but had fringy stuff when he first started out. Then, in 2017, everything picked up a notch, starting with a fastball that he threw all year at 90-95 mph. He uses both breaking balls, an average slider and curveball, as well as an outstanding changeup at all points in the count, setting up hitters and keeping them off-balance with aplomb. He keeps his stuff down in the zone and with sink to get groundball outs and the increased velocity and sharpness of it all led to a lot more strikeouts. He's never been one to walk guys and that didn't change even as his stuff got better.    There isn't a huge separation between him and JoJo Romero, who is a few spots ahead on this list.

He can drive the ball to all fields and was less pull happy in 2017, showing more ability to stay in the middle of the field and gap-to-gap as he's matured. That's led to fewer swings and misses and allowed Gerber to tap into his close-to-average power, with the potential to hit 15-18 homers annually. An average runner, Gerber can still steal a base now and again and can capably defend in all three outfield spots.

Since Muller became a pro, his stuff had been down, with a dip in velocity. Much of that, the Braves believe, was due to a mechanical breakdown in his delivery: His arm had gotten too straight overhand, instead of a more comfortable three-quarters slot.

The Indians nonetheless took a gamble on Capel in fifth round, and then surprised the industry by signing him for slot value. Assigned to Class A Lake County for his first full season, Capel's bat heated up with the weather as he overcame a slow start and improved with each month while flashing impresses tools. He finished among the Midwest League leaders with 22 home runs (third) and slugging (.482), and paced all Indians farmhands with 73 runs scored.   Capel has already made strides as a professional in cleaning up his left-handed swing, a good sign for any young hitter. Those adjustments helped Capel tap into his plus power in full-season ball, as he showed that he could hit the ball out to the deepest part of any ballpark with his combination of strength, bat speed and an improved bat path. And although Capel's uptick in power resulted in more strikeouts, he continued to recognize spin as part of a mature approach while also making plenty of hard contact.   Capel's above-average speed and strong instincts are qualifiers for him on the basepaths and in center field, and he has the arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot. He saw time at all three outfield positions in 2017. Capel stands to offer the most value if he can remain up the middle, where his power-speed combo would be a premium, but he also should produce enough to profile as a regular in either right or left.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mWkRt0PHN0w?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""5th rd 2016""","""Seven Lakes HS (TX)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""CLE""","""cle""","""CLE""","""|""",1,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,40,55,55,45,60,45,50,55,55,55,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,55,55,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Full Report:  Most high schoolers from the Northeast are understandably behind the kids from Florida, Texas and other warm weather areas, developmentally. Vasil is not. He consistently locates a mid-90s fastball in the zone and can throw his curveball for strikes when he wants to. Though Vasil finished his 2017 summer sitting 93-95, he collected dust in the backs of teams' minds as baseball got underway everywhere but the Northeast the following spring. His season finally began in early April, then was put on hold on April 23rd when Vasil left his start with an arm injury. He returned after a month and was 93-96 in his first start back. Shortly thereafter, Vasil, whose adviser is his father, announced via Twitter that he was withdrawing from the draft and going to Virginia. Vasil submitted necessary paperwork to make himself draft-eligible weeks ago, which means he has to petition MLB to formally take him out of the draft pool. It sounds like that will happen.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 50 | Overall: 50    It's become fairly commonplace for a Northeast area high schooler to rise up Draft boards and do well come June. Last year, there was Matt Tabor in Massachusetts, who went in the third round. Ian Anderson ended up as the No. 3 overall pick in the 2016 Draft, and back in 2015, Mike Nikorak landed near the end of the first round. Vasil looked very much like he fit near the top of this list until he walked off the mound of an April start holding his elbow, which left his Draft status up in the air, though a return to the mound in May assuaged some fears.    Vasil really jumped higher onto the national landscape by throwing well at USA Baseball's Tournament of Stars, when he was named to the 18-and-under trial roster (though he didn't make the final team), and he continued to pitch well as the weather warmed up in New England. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-95 mph range, but can reach back for 96-97 mph on occasion, and his heater has good life to it. His curve is above-average and scouts feel his changeup should develop into at least a Major League average offering. He is super competitive on the mound and while he has a similar build to Nikorak's at 6-foot-4, some scouts like Vasil's arm action and delivery better. He'll have to improve his command and control, but his repeatable delivery has evaluators confident it will get there.    Committed to Virginia, Vasil made a strong impression over the summer and was moving up boards until his injury. His return helps, but teams will have to have a comfort level with his health to take him in the first round.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/m2OcV1yoX7M?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""","""Boston College HS MA""","""Virginia""","""Boston College (Mass.)

Everything clicked for Flexen while in Double-A as he mixed three, and occasionally four, pitches well to keep Eastern League hitters flummoxed. His fastball was up to 95-96 mph with regularity. He showed a plus curve at times and an improved changeup, all of which he threw routinely for strikes. In Double-A, he didn't need fine command and could get away with missing spots, but that didn't fly in the big leagues. He tried to be too fine and hit corners and it didn't work for him. His curve regressed and he started going to an average slider with New York.   The Mets don't expect Flexen to have the kind of miniscule walk rate he showed in the Minors in 2017. If he can get back to trusting his stuff and stop nibbling, he could be a No. 4 type starter.

After working at 88-92 mph in 2016, Sauer now operates with a 92-95 mph fastball and touches 97, and he maintained his improved velocity through instructional league in the fall. He also showed some power with both a curveball and a slider as an amateur, and New York will have him focus going forward on his tight curve, which has the upside of a plus pitch. His changeup will require more work because he seldom used his as an amateur.    Sauer has the size for durability and the athleticism to throw strikes and make adjustments, so the Yankees envision him becoming a mid-rotation starter.

His bat-to-ball skills helped carry him all the way to Triple-A in 2017, with the fact that it comes in a middle infielder package only helping his value.

His walk rate took a hit at the upper levels in 2017, though he still has a career .340 on-base percentage heading into the 2018 season.

He's played all over the infield, seeing considerable time at shortstop -- his original position -- third and second base. In addition, he's now been traded twice. He went from the Jays to the D-backs in the August 2015 Cliff Pennington trade. Two years later, Arizona sent him to the Tigers in the deal for J.D. Martinez.  The D-backs had moved Lugo primarily to third base after he spent most of his first few seasons playing short. When the Tigers got him, he started at third, got a few games in at short and then moved to second at the end of the season. The organization liked what that looked like and had him put in work there during instructs and now thinks he has the chance to stick there if he can continue to improve his footwork, even if his plus arm looks better at third. Detroit also liked what it saw with Lugo's bat. He makes a ton of contact, and it's often loud, with a chance to be an above-average hitter. While he's been hit over power in his approach, there is raw pop there, with 15-homer seasons a bar he could clear.  If Lugo isn't penciled in as an everyday third baseman, there is less pressure on his bat. The Tigers think he could end up being a solid offensive-minded second baseman when all is said and done, knowing he could contribute as a bat-first utility man if the need arises.""",,,,,"""|""","""SF""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2011""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 3, 2011 - TOR""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""DET""","""det""","""DET""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",45,40,60,40,45,,55,45,60,40,50,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,45,40,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He has some feel to spin a breaking ball, but has struggled to find the right grip or the right type of shape for it, lacking the confident to throw it often enough. His control is another obstacle.

The trouble is he's had a hard time staying off the disabled list, with a back issue that cut short an otherwise successful 2016 season, a shoulder impingement that delayed the start to his 2017 and Tommy John surgery in July that will likely cost him all of 2018.  Szapucki has the makings of a very effective three-pitch mix when he's healthy. His explosive fastball is electric with plus life and he throws it in the 92-97 mph range. His power breaking ball can be a second plus pitch which freezes hitters and misses bats. There's a solid changeup in there as well, one with terrific fade and sink, though it was less consistent than the other two offerings. He has a deceptive delivery with a slightly lower arm slot that can add to his effectiveness. His command comes and goes at times as he struggles with his direction to the plate.  Szapucki is plenty young enough to come back and continue his climb up the Mets ladder, though his injuries have allowed him to throw just over 83 pro innings since being drafted.

He went out and had a very solid debut playing center field for Billings in the rookie-level Pioneer League.    The Reds were pleasantly surprised with how good Fairchild's approach was during his debut. There was an expectation of more swing and miss than there was; instead he struck out just 15 percent of the time while drawing a fair amount of walks, with it looking like he should carry a Major League average hit tool with him. Fairchild hit 17 homers in his junior year, but Wake Forest is a very good place to hit for power, so it remains to be seen if those numbers will transfer to the pro game. A plus runner, Fairchild can steal a base and he had better reads in center field than he did in college.

McKinney made his big league debut in 2018, but he was sent to the disabled list after one game with a sprained left shoulder joint.  McKinney's best attributes are his smooth left-handed swing, bat speed and hand-eye coordination. He demonstrated a disciplined approach at lower levels of the Minors but his Triple-A hot streak came when he got more aggressive at the plate. Scouts who believe his late-season surge is for real see his upside as a .280 hitter with 20 homers per year, though he attained that average just once while topping out at 16 homers in his first four full seasons.  McKinney broke into pro ball as a center fielder and has spent most of the last three years as a right fielder.

Adolfo has two exceptional tools in his raw power and his arm. His combination of bat speed, strength, loft and leverage in his right-handed swing gives him massive pop to all fields. He still needs to make more consistent contact, though he improved last year when he started to recognize pitches better and became less pull-conscious.  Adolfo has the best arm strength among Chicago's position prospects, further enhancing his right-field profile. He has average speed and should be an average defender on an outfield corner.

While Wade was just a ninth-round pick in 2015 after an injury-interrupted junior year at Maryland, he just keeps on producing, including an All-Star turn in the Double-A Southern League in 2017. He was playing well in the Arizona Fall League to cap off his year when he suffered a concussion in an outfield collision, though he is expected to be 100 percent for 2018.  Wade is a bit underrated because he doesn't have one tool that jumps off the page. His biggest skill is his ability to control the strike zone and he's walked more than he's struck out in his pro career. That plus some solid bat speed has led to hitting for a high average. He hasn't hit a ton of homers, but there is some pop from the left side and the Twins think he might be able to leverage the baseball a little more to tap into that raw power. He has decent speed and has shown the ability to play all three outfield spots.  If the extra-base ability comes around a bit more as he's knocking on the big league door, he could end up surprising people and becoming an everyday guy, best suited for left field.

He did have a solid return, pitching mostly in Double-A in 2017.  Molina's stuff did back up a bit during his return season, though he was still effective. His fastball that used to touch 95 mph, was more in the 91-93 mph range, though he threw it with good sink to induce groundball outs. His slider, which flashes above-average, and his changeup, an average offering, also weren't quite as sharp, but he showed enough glimpses for there to be confidence they'll be back to pre-surgery form in the future.

He can carry a mid-90s four-seam fastball into the late innings and reach 98 mph as a starter, though it's fairly straight, which has led him to fiddle with a two-seamer as well.

It led to him being ranked as MLB Pipeline's No. 17 international prospect, and the Nationals landed the then-16-year-old in July with a $3.9 million bonus, a franchise record for an international amateur, in July. That price tag was supported by Antuna's strong pro debut in the Rookie Gulf Coast League, where he showed impact potential at the plate as part of a loaded Nats GCL squad.   The switch-hitting Antuna is more polished at the plate than Washington's other 2016-17 international signees. He does most of his damage from the left side, where he exhibits preternatural barrel ability and consistently drives the ball with a leveraged swing. It's for that reason that scouts believe Antuna, who shows present pop to the gaps, ultimately could develop average over-the-fence power. Antuna also receives praise for his plate discipline as well as his pitch recognition, both of which fuel an approach that belies his age. Presently an above-average runner, Antuna is likely to lose a step as he physically matures.  Defensively, Antuna displays soft hands and good body control at shortstop, where his strong arm is also a clean fit. He was prone to defensive lapses at both short and third base during his pro debut, and some evaluators believe he'll eventually land at the hot corner on account of his modest defensive actions.""",,,,,"""|""","""CIN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2016""","""Dominican Republic""","""July 2, 2016 - WSH""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""WSN""","""was""","""WAS""","""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,20,40,55,40,55,50,45,50,50,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,55,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

His tremendous ceiling was on display with a move from the Dominican Summer League up to full-season ball in 2017 and the Pirates noticed, acquiring the gangly infielder in the Tony Watson deal last July.  Most of Cruz's upside comes in his power. He's more power over hit right now, and the ball jumps off of his bat. He has leverage and twitch at the plate, with plus game power not out of the question if he can get stronger and learn to control his body. His swing isn't overly long, but it does get out of control from time to time. Zone discipline will be a big area of focus as a refined approach will allow him to tap into that power more consistently. Cruz was a shortstop who moved over to third primarily in 2017, though some feel he has a chance to defy expectations and play up the middle. Cruz runs well and has a very strong arm, so a corner outfield spot might be his eventual home.  Cruz will be just 19 years old for all of 2018.

That hasn't been because of a lack of performance. Quite the contrary: Quinn has been dynamic, more often than not, when he's been on the field. The main issue has been his inability to stay there, as a number of injuries have kept him from playing more than 100 games in any one season, the most recent one a damaged UCL in his non-throwing elbow that didn't require surgery.    Quinn is still one of the fastest men in baseball, with true 80 speed on the 20-to-80 scale, with four seasons of 30 or more steals, all the more impressive considering how oft-interrupted they have been. His overall approach at the plate has changed as he's learned the importance of drawing walks and getting on base and while power is never going to be a huge part of his game, he has the strength to impact the ball enough to be a solid average hitter. He is a plus defender in the outfield with a strong arm.    While most of Quinn's injuries have been unrelated to each other, he did change his routine this offseason in order to try to maximize health.

The epitome of a power-armed reliever, Munoz owns the best fastball in San Diego's system and is one of the hardest throwers in the Minor Leagues. He offered a glimpse at that impressive velocity in the AFL, where he consistently pumped upper-90s heat and was up to 101 mph with a fastball that showed explosive late life. His hard slider in the upper 80s gives Munoz a second dynamic offering, one that should continue to improve along with his feel for pitching.   Munoz did make gains as a strike-thrower in 2017, but his high-effort delivery and issues in repeating his arm slot still leads to well-below-average control, as evidenced by his 6.7 walks-per-nine in two professional seasons.

Garcia has a knack for making good contact across the entire field using a quick, hands-y swing from the left side of the plate.

Full Report:  On the Cape and the first half of this spring, Lynch was a solid 3rd round prospect that pitched at 88-92 mph with mostly average stuff and above-average feel and command. In the last month or so, Lynch's velo has ticked up, and down the stretch he's been sitting 92-94, hitting 95 mph deep into starts with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flash above-average. It's obvious from observing Lynch that he isn't a fan of the Virginia pitching style, its characteristic mechanics and reliance on breaking balls. Most scouts have viewed this as positive as they aren't a fan of it or UVA's overall track record with pitching (Hultzen, Kirby, Jones, etc.) either and like that Lynch knows how he wants to pitch. He throws a cutter, slider, curveball and changeup that all flash above-average, with his slider occasionally flashing plus. Lynch, like many college pitchers including Florida's Brady Singer, doesn't throw his changeup much but it shows enough promise that it could be an above-average pitch with greater use. The Yankees are among the teams bearing down on Lynch down the stretch and he'll likely find a home in the 20's.""","""Scouting grades: Fastball: 50 | Slider: 50 | Curveball: 45 | Changeup: 55 | Control: 50 | Overall: 45  Over his first two seasons at the University of Virginia, Lynch struggled to put up decent numbers, getting hit and not missing a ton of bats. A very strong showing last summer in the Cape Cod League changed his trajectory and the southpaw has continued to pitch well in the Cavaliers' weekend rotation.  The 6-foot-4 southpaw does have room to add some strength and thus has some projection, though the pitchability lefty thing is working for him this spring. He commands his fastball, which sits in the 88-92 mph range in most starts, often touching 93 mph. His above-average changeup, thrown with excellent deception and late sink, is his best secondary offering. On the Cape, his breaking stuff was solid, but it's been not quite as sharp back in school. He has shown a solid slider and fringy curve, though they lack real bite at times.  With his size, relatively easy delivery, ability to throw strikes and solid stuff, many feel Lynch has the tools to start long-term. Others feel he's destined to be a fastball-changeup reliever.

He posted a 0.94 ERA after arriving in Double-A last June, lowering his career mark to 2.35 with 168 strikeouts in 149 2/3 innings.  Poyner may get more swings and misses on fastballs below 90 mph than any pitcher in the Minors. He usually operates at 88-89 mph but his heater plays as a plus pitch because of exquisite command and a lot of deception. His changeup is also a weapon, and the combination of his two best offerings helped him hold right-handers to a .441 OPS and strike them out at a 35 percent clip last year.  Poyner's hybrid breaking ball is closer to a slider than a curveball and doesn't distinguish itself with power or shape, so he's not quite as dominant against left-handers (.654 OPS, 35 percent strikeout rate).

His hitting ability, on the other hand, drew mixed reviews from scouts leading up to the 2015 Draft. The Mariners, believing in his bat, selected him in the third round, and he's since rewarded them. After a stellar pro debut followed by an inconsistent first season, Bishop enjoyed his most productive and consistent campaign to date in 2017, earning All-Star honors with Class A Advanced Modesto and then continuing to perform well after receiving a promotion to Double-A in July.   Bishop impacts the baseball more consistently now after lowering his hands in his setup at the plate -- an adjustment that was at the heart of his career-best .306/.393/.413 slash line and 41 extra-base hits across two levels in 2017. He stands to improve upon those marks as he continues to clean up his swing, but it's unlikely that he'll ever offer much in the way of over-the-fence power.  A well-above-average runner and defender, Bishop is graceful in center field with his great jumps and exceptional range. That speed also makes him a threat on the basepaths, though he still has gains to make with both his technique and feel for reading pitchers.   Bishop's bat will need to continue to develop for him to reach his ceiling as a top-of-the-order center fielder. Even if it doesn't, he has the hitting ability and speed-defense combo to be a productive fourth outfielder at the highest level.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""3rd rd 2015""","""Washington""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SEA""","""sea""","""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,20,40,70,60,55,40,30,40,70,70,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,30,65,55,65,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Impressed by Merrell's tools, most notably his plus-plus speed, and overall development on both sides of the ball, the A's selected him with the No. 33 overall pick in June, and then they saved money by signing him for less than slot value. Assigned to Class A Short Season Vermont for his pro debut, Merrell was hampered by minor shoulder and foot injuries, but still hit .320 with seven extra-base hits and 10 steals in 31 games.    The only player in USF history to lead the club in hitting in three consecutive seasons, Merrell, a left-handed hitter, raked at a career-best .384 clip as a junior to finish his college career with a .353 average in 153 games. Perhaps more significant was the power uptick that produced seven homers and led scouts to believe he might be more than someone who hits for a high but empty average. Merrell's near top-of-the-scale speed -- he ran a 10.6-second 100-yard dash as a prep -- makes him a basestealing threat, one who knows his job is to get on base and wreak havoc.    Merrell manned second base before making a full-time move to shortstop in 2017. His speed translates to above-average range at the position, though his other tools, such as his average arm strength, are merely modest fits. The A's will continue to deploy him there, but most scouts see a move in his future to either second base or center field, where his speed would truly be an asset.

The Cardinals are not alone in thinking that there's still a lot to work with with Greene, despite his rough season in Double-A a year ago.

So does his lack of consistent secondary stuff. Both his power breaking ball and his changeup will show glimpses of being average, if not better, but an inability to repeat his release point has made it tougher for him to throw them effectively and has resulted in surprisingly low strikeout rates.

The White Sox think setting up on the first-base side of the rubber costs him deception against right-handers, so they may alter his starting position.

Alcala's heater sat at 93-95 mph during his 2016 U.S. debut and operated at 95-98 last year.

Taylor's lithe frame is loaded with quick-twitch athleticism. It translates to good bat speed and better-than-expected power at the plate, with Taylor showing he can consistently impact the baseball. Those qualities give him a chance to be at least an average hitter, with power that should play in games more frequently once he becomes more physical and improves his pitch recognition. An average runner, Taylor earns high marks for his baserunning but will need to improve his reads and jumps to become an effective basestealer.   Taylor's athleticism also aids him at second base, where he profiles as an above-average defender who possibly could handle shortstop in a pinch.

He was having a bit of a breakout in Double-A in 2017 when a broken hand in June kept him out until the end of the of the Eastern League playoffs. Making up for lost time in the Arizona Fall League, he got the chance to move back to shortstop.  Kramer has a very solid approach from the left side of the plate, controlling the strike zone well and barreling up the baseball consistently, all of which points to a future of hitting for average and posting solid on-base numbers. Before the hand injury, he started tapping into his raw power a little more consistently and looked like the kind of hitter the Pirates thought he was when they drafted him, one who could bang out 12-15 homers annually. An average runner, Kramer's range is somewhat limited, but he is sure-handed and he didn't commit an error at short in Arizona.  For Kramer to be an everyday player, it will likely be at second base.

Assigned to Class A Advanced Carolina in 2017, Stokes, in his age-21 season, erupted to slug 14 home runs over 100 games to earn a late-July promotion to Double-A, where he added another six homers in just 35 games. Those 20 home runs, along with his 30 stolen bases, made Stokes one of 10 players to accrue at least 20 homers and 20 steals on the season.   Stokes may be an undersized right-handed hitter -- he's listed at 5-foot-8 -- but his compact frame is loaded with strength, giving him above-average power to his pull side that he can get to in games thanks to a leverage swing. A pull-oriented approach can limit the quality of Stokes' contact at times, while also resulting in too many strikeouts, but the overall approach is sound and he's shown solid on-base skills throughout his career.   Stokes is an above-average runner and knows how to apply his wheels on the basepaths and in the outfield. While his well below-average arm strength limits Stokes to a career in left, he has the offensive profile to make it work.

Morgan makes a living by pairing his well-commanded fastball with a well-above-average changeup that scouts viewed as one of the best in his Draft class.

After playing sparingly as a freshman, Diechmann erupted to hit 11 home runs the next year, then he blew past that total with 19 homers as a junior before going to the A's in the second round. After signing for $1.7 million, Deichmann showcased his impressive power by hitting eight homers in 46 games as Class A Short Season Vermont's everyday right fielder.    Deichmann's power is his calling card. The big left-handed hitter has impressed scouts with his bat speed and strength dating back to his high school days, and he's shown that he can get to it consistently in the past year-plus after shortening his swing and adopting a more selective approach. Deichmann's improved approach also has helped him in using the entire field, though much of his power remains to his pull side. And while strikeouts will always be a part of Deichmann's game given his power-over-hit profile, he does offset some of those concerns with perennially strong walk rates and on-base skills.    A shortstop in high school, Deichmann saw time at first base at LSU before finding a home in right field, where his above-average arm and power profile are clean fits. He's a below-average runner but moves well underway, and with improved reads and routes, he could become an average defender.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/27ocOVLfiqE?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""HOU""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2017""","""LSU""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""OAK""","""oak""","""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,30,60,50,40,55,50,55,60,45,45,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,55,40,55,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

It's hard to argue with the results, as Herget has pitched his way up to Triple-A, saving 64 games in the process after leading the organization in saves in 2017.    A big part of Herget's success is his ability to come at hitters from a variety of arm angles, but to label him as a trickster would be doing his stuff a disservice. He can get his fastball up to 97 mph while throwing it from three different angles with a ton of deception. He uses that fastball and his solid slider to miss a ton of bats, while mixing in an occasional changeup for left-handed hitters.

Lowther's best pitch is a fastball that sits at 87-90 mph and tops out at 93. It plays well above its fringy velocity, as he commands it well and creates deception by hiding the ball well before generating massive extension to the plate.

Lowther's ability to pitch off of his fastball increases the effectiveness of his above-average curveball and a changeup that ranges from fringy to average.

He's had trouble staying healthy, however, missing nearly all of 2016 with an elbow bone bruise and then needing Tommy John surgery in May of 2017. The Pirates thought his arm strength was worth the gamble, sending international bonus money to get him from the Phillies, who took him third in December's Rule 5.  Burdi is rehabbing from surgery and the Pirates are hopeful he can rediscover the nasty power stuff that made him look like a future closer. His fastball sits easily in the upper 90s and has hit triple digits. He backs that up with a nasty plus slider that serves as a true strikeout pitch and can even mix in a changeup against left-handed hitters. Command has been an issue and while hit doesn't have to be pinpoint, his time missed hasn't helped him learn to find the strike zone more consistently.

Thompson generates easy velocity when he's healthy, sitting 92-93 mph and reaching 95 mph with a fastball that has arm-side run and should continue to add velocity as he grows into his lanky 6-foot-7 frame.

After an impressive pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League, club officials are cautiously optimistic that Baumann, like Hays, could move relatively fast through the professional ranks.   A big and physical right-hander, Baumann can run his fastball up to 96-97 mph, but usually sits more in the 92-94 mph range, also using his height to his advantage to work on a downhill plane. He throws two breaking balls, a fringy curveball and a slider that flashes above average, as well as a promising changeup. Baumann is adept at missing bats, although the effort in his delivery, along with his longer arm action, does raise questions about Baumann's ultimate command profile.

He signed for $300,000 as a third-round pick and had an excellent pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.

His slider is relatively new to his arsenal but shows the makings of a second average-or-better pitch, thrown with power in the upper-80s, and he's also made strides in developing his changeup since signing.    Maese's athleticism is special, and it's easy to envision the young righty growing into his projectable frame in the coming years, though first he'll need to get healthy.

Conine came into 2018 with a good chance to join Marcus Stroman as the only first-round choices ever out of Duke, but a rough first half to his junior season means that probably won't happen. He rallied later in the spring and showed that he's still one of the better power hitters available in the 2018 Draft, capable of driving the ball out to all fields thanks to his bat speed and the loft he generates with his left-handed swing.

One of the most disciplined hitters in the system, , Beaty makes consistent contact thanks to his approach and hand-eye coordination. He made some adjustments to his left-handed swing during the summer so he could hit for more power, and 12 of his 15 homers came in the final three months. He handled lefties well in his first two pro seasons before slipping to a .651 OPS against them last year, and he'll have to improve to avoid being labeled as a platoon player.  With fringy first-step quickness and an average arm, Beaty serves as a decent defender at either infield corner. He also has played second base and both outfielder corners in pro ball and did some catching as an amateur. Beating out Cody Bellinger or Justin Turner for a starting job in Los Angeles may be an impossible task, but his bat and versatility could make him a useful reserve.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""12th rd 2015""","""Belmont""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""LAD""","""lad""","""LA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",45,45,55,40,40,50,55,50,55,40,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,45,45,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

After three summers of gaining little traction in the lower levels of Chicago's system, he was dealt to the Angels in the August 2016 Joe Smith deal. Things clicked in 2017, as Castillo pitched well across three levels, reaching Double-A, and was added to the 40-man roster this past offseason.  Castillo is all about pitchability and command of his average stuff. His fastball is average from a velocity standpoint, around 90-91 mph, but he throws it with extreme sink and gets a ton of ground-ball outs as a result. Both his curve and changeup have the chance to be average pitches and he throws his upper-70s breaking ball for strikes while maintaining good arm speed on his changeup. Castillo repeats his delivery very well, leading to above-average control, and gets more swings and misses than you'd expect thanks to deception and big-time extension out front.  With the D-backs and Cubs, Castillo had both started and relieved. The Angels' decision to commit to him as a full-time starter seems to be paying off.

With a pair of pitches that grade as well above average at their best, Ferrell could become a closer if he can find some more consistency. His fastball usually ranges from 93-98 mph with late life and his mid-80s slider has two-plane break and can be more unhittable at times. The Astros may have him work on a power curveball to give hitters a different look.

Targeting college arms, the Orioles made Akin their second-round pick that June, and he immediately impressed the organization during his pro debut with Class A Short Season Aberdeen.

Akin's repeatable delivery and clean arm action allow him to paint both sides of the plate with a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and reaches 96.

A full-time move to the bullpen led to a breakout first full season for Festa, as he showed impressive bat-missing ability, garnered All-Star honors in the Class A Advanced California League, and then capped his season with a successful turn in the Arizona Fall League. However, Festa began the year in extended spring training due to a hip/sciatic issue that has kept him off the mound so far in 2018.  Festa's smooth delivery and short, clean arm action create late life on a fastball that will sit 92-95 mph while touching 96.

Festa's four-pitch mix and overall durability makes him a candidate to one day rejoin a starting rotation, should the Mariners ever choose to pursue that route.

He was sent to the Braves in December 2014 as part of the Justin Upton trade and had a bit of a breakout offensively in 2016, though a hamate injury forced him out of the start of 2017 and seemed to negate any power gains he had made.    Now 100 percent healthy, Peterson, who was not protected on the 40-man roster and not taken in the Rule 5 Draft, can show that he's more of the 2016 version of him.

At his best, he mitigates a reasonable amount of strikeouts with a fair walk rate, especially given his power potential.

They were attracted to his work behind the plate and his intangibles, traits that led them to promote him to the short-season Northwest League for his U.S. debut last summer. He was the league's best defensive catcher as an 18-year-old and showed more offensive promise than his .228/.266/.338 line might indicate.  With his agility and soft hands, Amaya is an advanced receiver for a teenager, framing and blocking pitches well. His arm strength is average but plays better than that because he makes quick and accurate throws, and he erased 41 percent of basestealers in the NWL. His arm strength has improved since he has signed and he could be a plus thrower once he's fully developed.  Amaya has yet to make the same type of impact at the plate, but he has feel for the barrel and makes contact from the right side of the plate. It's not always quality contact, so he'll have to improve his discipline and wait for pitches he can do more damage against.

He stands out as easily the best left-hander in a system that has been short on southpaws since Julio Urias graduated to Los Angeles.  Ferguson added velocity to his fastball last year, sitting in the low 90s and peaking at 95 mph, and hitters still had trouble squaring it up even though it didn't feature quite as much sink as it had in the past. He gets swings and misses with his upper-70s curveball, which can become a plus if he lands it in the strike zone more consistently. He's gaining more trust in a fading changeup that should be at least an average third offering.  Though Ferguson's walk rate jumped from 0.7 per nine innings in 2016 to 4.0 last year, it should settle somewhere in between.

It proved to be a wise decision, as Sawyer drastically improved his Draft stock with a breakout performance in his first year as a full-time starter. Intrigued by his untapped potential in the role, the A's selected Sawyer in the ninth round and signed him for $45,000. Making his full-season debut in 2017, the big left-hander spent much of his time between Class A Beloit and Class A Advanced Stockton, while making a pair of Triple-A spot starts along the way. Overall, Sawyer ranked among the A's system leaders with 140 strikeouts (third), nine wins (fourth), a 3.58 ERA (fifth) and 130 2/3 innings pitched (sixth).   After working out of the bullpen exclusively during his pro debut, Sawyer made the transition to starting in 2017 and passed all tests. A 6-foot-5 southpaw whose delivery is loaded with deception, Sawyer pitches with fringe-average velocity, usually sitting around 90 mph. A changeup and a curveball comprise his secondary arsenal, with the former grading as an above-average pitch and the latter needing further refinement. He throws a lot of strikes but needs to improve his command, especially when it comes to his fastball.   Sawyer's effectiveness against same-sided hitters is his greatest strength, and he held them to a paltry .100/.202/.127 slash line in 125 plate appearances in his first full season. That said, he'll need to figure out a way to retire right-handed hitters to remain a starter after they slugged .446 with 17 home runs against him. Sawyer's future might not be as a starter, but there's enough there for him to carve out a bullpen role at the highest level.

After passing on his commitment to Texas Christian to sign for a below-slot $950,000, he burst into pro ball with 14 hits in his first five games. He finished third in the Rookie-level Arizona League batting race at .339 and played better defense than expected.  Though Gonzalez had some of the best right-handed raw power among high schoolers in the 2017 Draft, he just focused on making quality contact in his debut. He showed advanced pitch-recognition skills, controlled the strike zone and used an inside-out swing to drill line drives from gap to gap. As he gets stronger and turns on more pitches, he should start producing more home runs.

If the early returns are any indication, Diaz, who signed for $100,000 in September 2015 out of Venezuela, will be one of those bargain finds. He hit his way out of the Dominican Summer League to make his United States debut in his first summer, then took another big step forward in the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 2017.    Gains in strength led to an uptick in power, and the D-backs think Diaz has a lot more growing to do. With increased power comes increased responsibility to understand the strike zone. Diaz's strikeout rate went up in 2017 and he didn't draw as many walks as he was too aggressive, attacking early in the count at times. As he progresses, the right-handed hitter will have to learn to lay off the steady diet of breaking stuff he's sure to get from right-handed pitching. Better selectivity should lead to even more in-game power. Diaz runs very well and can steal a base as well as cover ground in center field, where the D-backs think he could stay for a while.    Even if he outgrows the position and has to move to a corner, he could have the offensive profile to be a regular as a five-tool right fielder. The D-backs don't have to worry about that decision yet, instead focusing on getting Diaz at-bats and watching the return on the investment grow.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2015""","""Dominican Republic""","""Sept. 3, 2015 - ARI""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""ARI""","""az""","""ARI""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,30,50,55,40,60,50,50,55,55,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,40,60,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

If healthy -- and he did leave the Arizona Fall League as a precaution because of shoulder soreness last fall -- Lopez has some nasty stuff well-suited for short relief. He throws his fastball regularly in the mid-to-upper 90s with some serious late life. His slider is a true wipeout pitch that greatly contributed to his insane 16.4 K/9 rate in Visalia last year.

He'll get up to 95 mph with his fastball, throwing it anywhere in the 90-95 mph range.

He returned to Biloxi in 2016 only to require Tommy John surgery that would sideline him until July '17. He pitched at two levels upon returning, and then made up for lost time with a stint in the Arizona Fall League.    A big and physical righty, Houser operates at 93-97 mph with a fastball that has good sinking action and run that nets him ground-ball outs. His curveball, thrown with powerful 12-to-6 action in the low 80s, receives plus grades from scouts, while his changeup gives him a third pitch, albeit one that he throws too firmly and will need to improve. Houser's physicality allows him to consistently repeat his delivery and keeps him around the zone, though he still has gains to make with both his control and command.    The Brewers will continue to develop Houser as a starter, with the hope that he'll ultimately return to his pre-surgery form.

That was especially true since he was immediately moved from behind the plate, where he played at the University of Virginia, to first base. He did make his way to Double-A in his first full season and capped things off with a stint in the Arizona Fall League.    Thaiss utilizes an advanced approach at the plate to see a lot of pitches and draw walks, leading to a system-best 77 free passes in his first full season and a .375 on-base percentage. That, combined with a contact-oriented philosophy, should allow him to hit for a high average, and it was encouraging that he performed better in that category after his move up to Double-A in 2017. There are concerns that Thaiss won't have the power to fit the first base profile, but there is more pop for him to tap into and he sees value in knocking out 30 doubles annually while trying to get on base at a 40 percent clip, a pace he was keeping up in Double-A.    Thaiss has continued to work on his defense at his new position, something he prioritized in 2017, and he should be capable there.

When he didn't fare any better during his first full-season campaign with Class A Lansing in 2013, the Blue Jays began to transition the athletic right-hander to the mound. Ramirez made big gains in a bullpen role before breaking out in 2017, when he tossed 37 2/3 scoreless innings between the Double- and Triple-A levels to earn a September callup. He returned to the Majors in early 2018, only to be designated for assignment and claimed off waivers by Oakland in May.   Ramirez has improved on the mound in each season since his transition. Making considerable strides as a strike-thrower was a difference-maker for him in 2017, and he showed newfound control and command of his dynamic fastball-slider pairing. A 6-foot-5 righty, Ramirez operates comfortably at 92-94 mph with a high-spin-rate fastball that nets him whiffs inside the strike zone. He complements it with a swing-and-miss, plus slider in the low 80s, a pitch that he can throw for a strike or bury outside the zone as the situation dictates.  Set to play the 2018 season at age 27, Ramirez may be older than the traditional prospect, but he also has untapped potential in his bullpen role. He flashed much of that during his accelerated rise through the Minors and could emerge as a late-inning force as a big league reliever.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,"""Mar. 5, 2009 - TOR""","""|""",,,,,"""|""",,"""tor""","""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",55,,,55,,,,55

The right-hander got into eight big league games before being sent back to Minnesota in late April.    A lot of things clicked for Bard, the younger brother of former big leaguer Daniel Bard, at the upper levels of the Minor Leagues in 2017 and he used his fastball-slider combination to miss more bats than he had any previous point in his career. From a pure velocity standpoint, Bard's 94-95 mph average fastball is a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, but it can play up because it has plus riding movement and spin.

It was the fourth round of the 2010 Draft that Kingham was plucked from the Las Vegans prep ranks, to be precise, but Kingham dropped from the radar because of May 2015 Tommy John surgery. He did return in the second half of 2016 and pitched all of 2017 in Triple-A.  The Pirates were happy that Kingham largely got a full, healthy season in after his year was initially delayed by an ankle injury, knowing that some dead arm periods were to be expected. He was a little timid in the first half, especially in throwing his above-average changeup, the pitch he blew out on in 2015. His command came back just fine, though he was too hittable at times. He throws his low-90s fastball downhill, getting a fair amount of ground-ball outs while his curve is solid average and that changeup has very good sink.  Kingham got over the hump in the second half of 2017 and the Pirates believe he's readier than ever to contribute to the big league club.

He signed right at the July deadline because the Cubs had to wrap up negotiations with first-rounder Alex Lange to clear money for Estrada so they wouldn't lose a future first-rounder as a penalty for exceeding their bonus pool.  In his brief pro debut, Estrada showed the 92-96 mph fastball that excited scouts the previous summer, not the reduced 88-92 mph heater he had during the spring. He also reclaimed a changeup that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. His breaking pitches are less advanced after he relied more on a slider during his senior season and detracted from what had been a solid curveball.

Dunand's big, raw power was too enticing to pass over for the Marlins, who secured his future with a $1.2 million bonus after selecting him in the second round. He opened his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League but quickly hit his way up to the Class A Advanced Florida State League, where he appeared in three games before a finger injury prematurely ended his season.   Dunand's intrigue lies in his potential to hit for both average and power. The latter is more strength-driven than it is a product of his bat speed, though he does know how to get to it. Dunand hit for more average during his final two NC State campaigns, as well as in the Cape Cod League, but he'll need to control the zone better and make more contact to be successful as a pro.   As a fringy runner with a thicker lower half, Dunand isn't a clean fit on paper at shortstop. However, Marlins club officials have been impressed with his performance there so far, noting that he has the instincts and feel for the position despite a lack of outstanding defensive tools.

He has little experience throwing a changeup and figures to scrap it if he winds up in the bullpen.  The Rangers haven't given up on Speas as a starter and hope he can gain some confidence from his success as a reliever and during instructional league. His athleticism and clean arm action should help him throw strikes, but he has trouble keeping all of the moving parts in his delivery in sync. He has the ceiling of a frontline starter or closer but also the floor of a guy who can't pitch his way past Double-A, and 2018 should provide a clearer picture as to which path he'll take.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ja_dnjJCRDU?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""OAK""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2016""","""McEachern HS (GA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TEX""",,"""TEX""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",60,40,50,,,,,30,70,45,60,,,,,45,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",70,40,60,,,,,40

Rivera's hand-eye coordination and penchant for making hard contact suggest that his hitting ability is very real. He began to tap into his solid raw power more often in 2017, and he could do so even more if he adds some loft to his right-handed stroke because he hits a lot of ground balls. He also walks infrequently because he puts the ball in play so easily.  One of the best all-around players in the Royals system, Rivera also offers quality defense at third base.

He made contact against good high school pitching last summer but, this spring, it was louder and more authoritative as his swing has become more whippy and explosive, albeit somewhat long.

While he's not quite at that level, Ornelas has shown he is the clear No. 3, raising his profile considerably with strong play early in the spring while many decision-makers were in the state during Spring Training.    Even if that early helium has slowed a bit, Ornelas still has a combination of skills that should interest a number of teams. Athletic and high energy, Ornelas has a little Javy Baez to his game, both in terms of his flash and his tools. He is capable of making loud contact from the right side of the plate, though he can have trouble at times with being on time using his big leg kick. There is some swing and miss to his game, but he also has the chance to hit for a good amount of power. He has the hands and arm to stay on the left side of the infield, though many feel that he's destined to move to third because of a lack of foot speed.    A team taking Ornelas might want to send him out as a shortstop and let him play his way off, and he'd likely man the premium position should he go on to the University of Tennessee.

His curveball already had good depth and added power as well, becoming a consistent plus pitch. His changeup isn't as consistent as his other offerings but has the makings of an average pitch.  Because Alexy didn't become a full-time pitcher until his junior year in high school, he's just scratching the surface of his potential.

He gave up his last year of football to focus on baseball, and he's one of the more athletic and projectable pitchers available in the 2018 Draft.

Ashcraft has a loose, quick arm yet there were games this spring when he was pitching at 85-88 mph in the late innings. He created excitement among scouts when he began sitting at 92 mph and topping out at 94 during the postseason, and his heater also features sink and his 6-foot-5 frame creates difficult extension and angle.

He has advanced quickly, rising from Rookie ball to high Class A in less than three months in 2016 and advancing to Double-A two months into last season. He has generated infrequent and weak contact, averaging 9.8 strikeouts per nine innings and a 2.6 groundout/airout ratio in his first three years as a pro.  Valdez generates all those strikeouts and groundouts with three pitches that all tend to drop at the plate. His two-seam fastball usually sits at 91-96 mph with heavy life and his low-80s curveball has so much power and depth that it can overmatch both left-handers and right-handers. His changeup isn't as reliable but can be a solid third offering when he keeps it down in the strike zone.  Though he has cleaned up his mechanics some since signing, Valdez is still short and stocky and has significant effort in his delivery. His control took a significant step backward in 2017 and he got hit hard for the first time when he didn't locate his pitches well in Double-A, increasing the chances that he'll eventually move to the bullpen.

His stuff has improved since entering the professional ranks, enabling the right-hander to make a quick rise through the Minor Leagues. After a dominant performance with Double-A Montgomery in his second full season, Gibaut opened 2018 on the cusp of the Major Leagues in Triple-A.   One of many hard-throwing relievers in the upper tiers of Tampa Bay's system, Gibaut attacks hitters with a mid-90s fastball that consistently reaches 97 mph with late life. He throws a pair of quality secondary pitches in a power slider that's been up to 90 mph with late diving action, and a changeup that at times plays above its plus grade. The three-pitch mix makes Gibaut effective against right- and left-handed hitters alike, and he's long showed the ability to keep the ball in the park.

He tied for the Rookie-level Arizona League lead with six triples in only 32 games and ranked fourth in the short-season Northwest League with eight homers in just 23 contests, a tantalizing power display for an 18-year-old middle infielder.

If he develops more patience and uses the entire field, he could hit for a decent average while still hitting 15-20 homers on an annual basis.  Tejeda has more than enough arm for shortstop but his speed and range are average, so it's unclear if he'll stay at the position.

Rivas has plus on-base skills that stand out especially given how young he is. He walked more than he struck out in 2017 and didn't lose his approach at all with the promotion to the Midwest League and brings a career .420 on-base percentage with him into the 2017 season. A switch-hitter, Rivas is small, but isn't frail and is considered one of the stronger players, pound-for-pound, in the system, though power is never going to be a part of his game. His speed will be and he's already shown aptitude for being an efficient basestealer. With an above-average arm, good hands and plus instincts, Rivas can handle playing shortstop on a daily basis if needed.  At age 20 for all of 2018, Rivas will still see a lot of time at the premium position, but will continue to work at other positions, partially because of the presence of players like Kevin Maitan, but also to improve his value via versatility. He could be a utility man when all is said and done, but if he settled in as an everyday middle infielder, no one would be surprised.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tbf-2kCq_yI?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2014""","""Venezuela""","""July 11, 2014 - LAA""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""LAA""","""laa""","""ANA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,20,30,70,40,50,50,30,40,70,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,30,60,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He made his U.S. debut in 2017, earning Midwest League All-Star honors with Class A Fort Wayne, though overall it was a lackluster season for the physical strong outfielder.  Ona stands out on the field for his muscular physique and huge raw power. At the plate, the right-handed hitter combines strength and bat speed to generate plus power, and he's shown the ability to drive the ball out of the park across the entire field. Yet, Ona hit just 11 homers in the Midwest League as a 20-year-old in 2017, a product of an approach and swing that are both inconsistent and leave him susceptible to sequencing. That, along with his penchant for swinging and missing, leads some scouts to question the overall utility of his hit tool.

That's not the case with Blackwood, a wiry, 6-foot-5 right-handed sidearmer whom the A's drafted in the 14th round last in 2016 after three seasons of closing games at Memphis. He became the first player from the 2016 Draft class to reach a full-season level, moving up to Class A Beloit from Short Season Vermont roughly a month into his career, and then served as Class A Advanced Stockton's closer for all of '17 before an impressive showing in the Arizona Fall League.  Blackwood's velocity is atypical compared to hurlers with a similar arm slot, as he'll sit at 91-93 mph with heavy sink that results in extreme ground-ball contact but few whiffs. He pairs it with an average breaking ball as well as a changeup, both of which play up on account of his tremendous deception, although he'll need to develop the latter in order to be successful against lefties. He does an excellent job of keeping the ball in the park and enters 2018 having allowed just three home runs in 83 1/3 career innings.

He returned in 2015, then came on strong in 2016 as a redshirt junior, landing in the fifth round of that June's Draft. He put the surgery even further behind him with a strong first full season of pro ball that saw him throw more than 150 innings and reach Double-A.  More than anything, Irvin has a keen sense of who he is as a pitcher. He has a four-pitch mix, mostly average when graded out, but really knows how to use it well. His fastball is usually in the 91-92 mph range, though he can reach back for a bit more at times. He throws both a two- and four-seamer and has shown he is adept at getting weak contact on the ground. He has two distinct breaking balls, and is smart enough in his use of them to pick one over the other in any given start depending on the lineup he is facing. The changeup is just as good, if not a bit better, than the other three. He can throw strikes with any pitch at any point in the count.  Irvin has already shown some mastery of pitch sequencing and making adjustments, something the Phillies expect to see after he fell victim to the long ball in the hitting-friendly confines of Reading last year.

Gustave can operate in the upper 90s and hit 102 mph with his fastball as a reliever. However, he has more success when he dials his heat down to 95-99 and gets more run, sink and control.

The Orioles selected Stewart with their first of two picks in the first round the next year, only to see him struggle during much of his first two seasons before finishing 2016 on a positive note. A revamped swing helped Stewart to rebound in earnest in his first Double-A campaign, as he produced a .278 average with 21 homers and 20 steals over 126 Eastern League contests.   After hitting from an open, over-exaggerated crouch in college and to begin his pro career, Stewart has worked to become more upright at the plate while also closing off in his stance. It's resulted in a more fluid swing that better incorporates his hands and wrists, thus allowing him to catch up to inner-half velocity and hit for power during games. Stewart's patient approach and strong on-base skills have long been strengths, and he continues to offer value on the basepaths with his average speed.   While Stewart's speed and athleticism are better than his stocky build might suggest, he's already been relegated to left field on account of his fringy glove and below-average arm. Stewart contributes in enough facets of the game to serve as a fifth outfielder, and there's still a chance of him developing into a regular if his bat and power hold up at higher levels.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ssq2Nfrjfk?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""1st rd 2015""","""Florida State""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""BAL""","""bal""","""BAL""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,40,60,40,40,40,40,55,60,40,45,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,45,50,40,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He's one of the more stable college bats in the second/third round range.""","""Scouting grades: Hit: 50 | Power: 45 | Run: 60 | Arm: 50 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45    Isbel has been a three-year starter at UNLV, but it's been a breakout junior season, following an All-Star campaign in the Cape Cod League over the summer, that has not only helped UNLV turn things around, but has put him firmly in the conversation among teams looking for college bats in the top three rounds.    The left-handed-hitting Isbel has been raking all year in the middle of the Rebels' lineup, showing a very good approach at the plate and compact swing that sends line drives to all fields. There's some power to tap into as well, especially to the pull side, though he's capable of driving the ball the other way. He could have average power when all is said and done, with 12-15 homers a more realistic possibility. Isbel has good speed on the basepaths and in center field, and his instincts could allow him to stay there.    Isbel reminds some of Jason Kipnis as an amateur. Like Kipnis did for a couple of years at Arizona State, Isbel is a former infielder playing the outfield. Isbel played third as a freshman and saw some time at second on the Cape last summer. If teams believe he can stick on the dirt, that could raise his Draft stock even more.""",,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ED60S6KU3Bw?autoplay=1""","""|""",,,,"""|""","""KC""",94,,,,"""|""","""UNLV""","""""","""UNLV""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,1,0,0,"""|""","""""","""-""","""+""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,45,60,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He emerged as one of the organization's more promising middle-infield prospects in his first professional season, showing an advanced defensive skill set at shortstop as well a promising bat while playing in the Dominican Summer League. That performance put him on the A's radar, and they acquired him and reliever Emilio Pagan in November in exchange for Ryon Healy, further adding to the organization's glut of promising young shortstops.   Evaluators believe Campos has the potential to stick at shortstop. He's an athletic and instinctual defender with good actions and the plus arm strength needed for the position. Campos' above-average speed translates on both sides of the ball, though he has gains to make as a baserunner. At the plate, the right-handed hitter is short to the ball and has good feel for the barrel, resulting in lots of line drives and some gap power, and he already has shown on-base skills -- he recorded more walks (41) than strikeouts (39) in his pro debut - thanks to an advanced approach.  Campos has started to grow into his athletic frame since signing and should continue to tack on good strength. His defense-speed combination at an up-the-middle position gives him a possible floor as a big league reserve, though further progress at the plate could very well thrust him into the conversation as an everyday player.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2016""","""Venezuela""","""July 4, 2016 - SEA""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""OAK""",,"""OAK""","""|""",0,1,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,20,30,50,40,55,55,40,45,50,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,35,55,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The Pirates ended nabbing him in the fourth round and gave him well above pick value to sign him away from his University of Florida commitment. He's moved methodically, pitching across two rookie levels in his first two summers of pro ball.    While in the Appalachian League, Ogle's biggest focus was his focus. His energy level seemed to ebb and flow from start to start. One outing, you'd see a 94-96 mph fastball; the next, it'd be 89-90 mph as he would let his foot off the gas. As a left-hander who can throw strikes with three pitches at a low level -- his hard curve can be average and he has some feel for his changeup -- he was still able to have a modicum of success, but he was learning that he'll need more consistent energy as he moves forward. While his delivery has improved as a pro, he still needs to work on keeping his front side quieter, which should lead to better overall command.    The Pirates have drafted and developed more than a fair share of high schooler arms with ceiling.

He spent most of the previous two seasons in Triple-A, smacking a career-best 26 homers in 2017.  At 6-foot-4, Patterson has a naturally long left-handed swing but he worked to shorten it when he entered pro ball. He developed a line-drive stroke that didn't take full advantage of his strength and bat speed, then added more loft to his swing and put more balls in the air last season. The added power enhances his profile as a potential regular in the big leagues.  Patterson primarily played right field while seeing sporadic time at first base during his first four pro seasons before spending most of his time at first in 2017.

Graduating to full-season ball in 2016, Cabrera earned mid-season All-Star honors in the Class A Midwest League at age 19, though he did wear down physically late in the season. He continued to make developmental strides in 2017, beginning the season in the Florida State League and then moving up to Double-A at the midseason mark, pitching well at both stops.   Though he's thinly built, Cabrera has a live arm that produces easy velocity in the form of a 92-95 mph fastball with late life that has been up to 97 in the past. His slider registers in the mid- to high-80s, thrown with late, short slicing action that gives it a cutter-like feel, and he also has the makings of an advanced changeup that aids his effectiveness against right-handed hitters. What's more, the young southpaw is adept at changing hitters' eye levels from an over-the-top release point, though some scouts worry about his ability to create favorable downhill plane given his height.  That Cabrera already repeats his delivery well bodes well for his chances of remaining a starter, especially with so much physical projection remaining in his wiry frame. He has the arsenal and control profile to develop into a big league starter, although his fastball-slider pairing also gives him a bright future as a reliever, one who is particularly effective against same-sided hitters but also capable of recording outs on both sides of the plate.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/sKhWIR1ZYYA?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""LAN""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""J2 2013""","""Dominican Republic""","""Nov. 11, 2013 - TB""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TBR""","""tb""","""TB""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",55,45,,40,,,,30,55,55,,45,,,,40,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,45,,55,,,,50

The slender right-hander had been a Futures Game participant in 2015, but injuries and a lack of strength necessitated a move to the bullpen, and he was able to dominate two levels of A ball in 2017 pitching in shorter stints.    The D-backs had hoped Huang would be able to add strength because he had a three-pitch mix that could work as a starter. But starting with a back injury that hampered him early and followed later by other minor nicks, combined with his relative inability to add strength, the move to the bullpen was necessary. The good news is his stuff really spiked in the role. His fastball sat in the mid-90s and his curve was filthy at times, with straight downer action. He has a good changeup, but didn't throw it as much in this role, with his fastball-curveball combination more than good enough.    The D-backs didn't want to limit Huang to just one inning at a time, using almost a modified piggyback system to get him multiple innings every time out.

His fastball has touched 97 mph and now sits comfortably in the low 90s after he pitched mostly in the upper 80s prior to signing with Toronto. His curveball is a swing-and-miss offering and represents his best secondary pitch, receiving easy plus grades from evaluators, and his changeup projects to be at least average once fully developed. Pardinho's arm action is clean and efficient, and he demonstrates the ability to repeat his delivery, a good sign for any young pitcher.  Pardinho has impressed scouts with his advanced approach on the mound and experience against top competition, though there is some concern about his overall upside and durability given his smaller frame.

His career stalled when he got to Double-A midway through his first full pro season and started selling out for power, though he rebounded with a more moderate approach in 2016. After making his big league debut that year, he was poised to get regular at-bats in Kansas City in 2017, but never appeared for the Royals and appeared in just 33 Minor League games because of an oblique strain and a hamate injury.  Dozier got back on track when he recognized that he had enough strength and loft in his right-handed swing to produce at least average power without focusing on home runs. Though he tried to do too much at times in 2017 while trying to make up for lost at-bats, he's at his best when he shortens his stroke and uses the entire field. He has the upside of a .260-.270 hitter with 20 homers per season.   A shortstop at Stephen F. Austin State, Dozier moves reasonably well for a 6-foot-4, 220-pounder. A below-average runner with an arm that produced low-90s fastballs as a college reliever, he's an adequate defender at either infield corner.

Harris possesses a deep arsenal but lacks an impact pitch. He sits in the low 90s and can reach back for more with his fastball, throwing the pitch with sinking action and late arm-side life, but also catching too much of the plate too often.

He was thought to be the best pure prep hitter in that 2015 class and he hit like it during his summer debut in the Gulf Coast League. A shoulder injury interrupted his first full season, though he still showed a solid approach, then he shifted gears and started showing more power in a healthy 2017.    The increased power output was by design, as Randolph changed his hitting philosophy, going from a middle-to-opposite field approach type of hitter to one who learned how to turn on pitches and pull them out of the park. While he still drew walks, his strikeout rate spiked and his average suffered, but learning to drive the ball to the right-center gap and out will serve him well as he tries to reincorporate his natural tendency to use all fields. Randolph is going to have to hit because he is limited to left field only. He won't ever be a Gold Glover, but he's worked to be adequate there.    As a corner outfielder, his ability to hit and hit for power become that much more important.

They never got a chance as a stress fracture in his back kept him off the mound all spring.When healthy, Beck may be the most complete college pitcher on the West Coast in this class. While he has added some good weight since high school, he still is lean and wiry. He has a good feel for three pitches, all of which he can throw for strikes. His fastball sat in the 91-92 mph range. With his frame, there might be room for more velocity, but he's never going to be a power pitcher. Instead, he relies on his excellent fastball command. His best secondary pitch is an outstanding changeup, and he'll throw a solid breaking ball, though sometimes he hangs them up in the zone.The scenario this year is reminiscent of scouts waiting for Cal Quantrill to come back from Tommy John surgery last year as a Stanford junior. Quantrill didn't throw a competitive pitch, but went No. 8 overall to the Padres.

None of them throw harder than Bautista, whose pro debut was delayed because of a positive steroid test and was moved from starting to relief work in 2016. The Mets liked his arm strength enough to add him to the 40-man roster this past offseason to protect him from being selected in the Rule 5 Draft.  Bautista has top-of-the-scale velocity with his fastball, a heater that sits 98-99 mph and touches triple digits with plus life to it. He doesn't always have a feel for where it's going, however, walking 4.7 per nine innings in 2017. His slider will flash plus, but is also inconsistent, and he will need to land it for strikes to keep progressing. He also has an interesting changeup that could help him, especially against left-handed hitters, if he commits to throwing it.  Right now, Bautista is all about premium velocity and projection.

Able to shake off a rough California League performance in 2016, Jewell moved up to Double-A the following season and showed enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.

His slider flashes plus with cutter-like movement, and while his changeup is very inconsistent, he is capable of showing a solid one from time to time with split-like action.

Buttrey worked with a low-90s fastball and peaked at 96 mph in high school, but his velocity dropped for much of his time as a pro starter. He began throwing harder again after making mechanical adjustments in 2015 and harder still once he moved to the bullpen and worked shorter stints. He operated at 93-98 for much of last season before sitting in the upper 90s and touching 101 mph in the Arizona Fall League.  Buttrey's fastball isn't as overpowering as it seems because it straightens out and he doesn't command it consistently. He can miss bats with a circle changeup that features splitter action but never has come up with a reliable breaking ball, scrapping a knuckle-curve and a conventional curve in favor of a low-80s slider with modest break.

He kept hitting and showing an advanced approach at the plate in 2017, earning two promotions in the process. He continued to draw walks, and while his strikeout rate went up, he doesn't chase very often and showed some more extra-base pop, especially late in the season. He's always had good speed and used it with much greater success a year ago, leading the organization in stolen bases.  Hermosillo continues to see time in all three outfield spots, though he's played more center field than anywhere else.

Though he struggled in his 2017 professional debut in the Class A Short Season Northwest League, Almanzar also played the entire summer at 17, making him one of the circuit's youngest players.  Almanzar can hit to all fields and has a slightly uppercut swing that causes the ball to jump off his bat, leading scouts to believe that he'll hit eventually hit for average as well as for some power. He's athletic and toolsy, with good footwork and the ability to defend, and he also impresses scouts with his strong and accurate arm. Almanzar's thicker build has already led to reduced time at shortstop and more time at the hot corner, which many believe will be his final defensive home.   Should he end up at third base, Almanzar will need to hit for both average and power to accommodate the position's traditional profile.

Gatorade's South Carolina player of the year, Jones is an elite athlete with a projectable frame and the potential for five tools. He has a quick right-handed bat, but a swing that can get long at times and results in too many whiffs. However, scouts expect his hitting aptitude to improve, and for him to develop some power, now that he's strictly focused on baseball. A plus-plus runner, Jones' wheels aid him in center field, where he shows good range, but lacks instincts. His arm is strong enough to profile at all three outfield spots.

Getting away from his low-three quarters arm slot in '16 cost Medeiros both velocity and life on his fastball.

The jury is still out on whether Medeiros, with his unique arm slot and underwhelming control profile, can remain a starter long term.

A physically mature right-hander with a frame that requires minimal projection, Bednar is a reliever all the way.

Rodriguez has a chance to be a special hitter, one who projects to hit for average and already shows robust raw power during batting practice. Rodriguez does have a pre-pitch waggle in the batter's box that can get his timing out of sync at times and results in some swing-and-miss, but his advanced approach at the plate and his overall bat speed helps solve some of the issues caused by his developing batting mechanics. Overall, he has the ability to drive the ball to all fields and he consistently makes hard contact.

Decker isn't the toolshed his more famous predecessor is, but he does have one strong carrying tool: his raw power. It's legitimate and it shows up presently. He's very physical now, without a ton of projection. He's more power over hit, with some length to his swing, but he does have good rhythm at the plate, giving him a better shot of tapping into that strength. Decker will be an average runner in the future with a decent arm, likely profiling as a left fielder in the future.    Committed to Maryland, Decker fits the corner outfield profile.

There's no question, though, that Cate's future is as a starter, though while he began 2018 as the Huskies' Friday night guy for the second season in a row, a cloud hung over his Draft stock as forearm tightness forced him to miss several starts.    Cate might have the best breaking ball in the entire Draft class, the kind of 12-to-6 hammer he could tell hitters was coming during his sophomore year and they still couldn't put it in play. He throws it from the same plane as his fastball so effectively, hitters never have a chance to pick it up well. He'll throw it whenever he wants in the count and can command it very well in the strike zone. That allows his 90-93 mph fastball to be more effective. It has more run than sink, with average life overall, but he can throw it to both sides of the plate consistently. His changeup is a little firm, but he shows enough feel for it to be a future average offering.    Cate isn't the biggest guy in the world at 6 feet, and concern about overuse during his time at UConn certainly wasn't assuaged with his 2018 injury.

The hulking first baseman subsequently emerged as one of the organization's better pure hitters, delivering a career-high 23 home runs and finishing second and third in the Eastern League in on-base percentage (.387) and slugging (.530), respectively in 2016. Though he was unable to build on that success in his first Triple-A campaign, Tellez also spent the entire season as a 22-year-old at the Minors' highest level.   A physically strong left-handed hitter, Tellez possesses the requisite bat speed to turn on premium velocity as well as the barrel control to drive the ball out of the park the other way. He became trapped between the two approaches often in 2017, and the result was less impactful contact as well a drop-off in his power, as Tellez's six home runs marked his lowest output at any full-season level. Said approach continued to net him a healthy number of walks, though, and Tellez's manageable strikeout rate suggests he'll resume hitting for both average and power. He'll need to show more utility against same-sided pitching (.148/.235/.213 in '17) to be a regular.  Though a fringy defender at first base, Tellez has worked hard to upgrade his defense to where it should at least be serviceable. Meanwhile, Blue Jays officials rave about Tellez's work ethic and makeup, citing his determination to improve his body and defense as examples. The first-base-only profile is a notoriously difficult one to achieve, but Tellez has the hitting ability and power to make it happen.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/jEnF7574CyA?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""SF""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""30th rd 2013""","""Elk Grove HS (CA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""","""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",40,50,60,40,40,30,50,55,60,30,45,30,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,20,45,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

When he returned to the mound in July 2017, Fenter showcased much of his pre-surgery stuff during a strong stint back in the GCL.   Fenter gets the most out of his stocky frame to produce a plus fastball that reached 95 mph late in the season. The pitch typically sits in the low 90s with sinking action that fuels his ground-ball tendencies. Fenter has good feel for spinning a curveball, giving him a second above-average pitch, and he also mixes in a fringy slider. He threw both sparingly upon returning from surgery, and the same goes for a fading changeup that should continue to get better with greater usage.  Fenter has a strong frame and repeats his delivery well, though there is effort to his delivery.

He homered in three of his first games at Rookie-level Grand Junction and ranked second in the Pioneer League with 19 homers, one behind teammate Casey Golden.    Spanberger garners some comparisons to Chris Davis because he's a first baseman with big-time left-handed power and swing-and-miss concerns. His bat speed, strength and leverage give him massive raw power to all fields, and he doesn't get cheated with an aggressive approach. While he probably won't hit for a high average, he did make strides with using the entire field and made more consistent contact in 2017.

While the former has yet to play a game above the Rookie level, Feliciano played his entire full-season debut as an 18-year-old in the Class A Midwest League, showing a combination of hitting ability and raw-but-improving defensive skills that have the Brewers excited about what his future may hold.    Feliciano stands out for his potential at the plate. With a clean right-handed swing, feel for the barrel and good strength to his frame, Feliciano knows how to generate hard contact, and he does so to all fields. Those qualities, as well as his advanced approach, give Feliciano a chance to hit for average. And although his raw power translates to mostly doubles right now, he's expected to develop at least modest over-the-fence power as he gets stronger and learns to better leverage his swing.    Feliciano is an impressive athlete who runs well, especially relative to his position. That athleticism aids him behind the plate, where he's an agile but fundamentally raw defender with an above-average arm.

But sometimes such adversity can work to a team's advantage. Case in point is Mitchell, who entered his senior year at powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego as one of the best prep bats in the country. When he scuffled for a chunk of the season, his stock fell and the Pirates were thrilled he slipped far enough for them to grab him in the second round with the 50th overall pick in the 2017 Draft.  Mitchell did look more like the hitting prospect people thought he was during his pro debut in the Gulf Coast League. He has an advanced approach at the plate and drew a ton of walks, controlling the strike zone very well for his age, with the chance to be a Major League average, if not better, hitter from the left side of the plate. There is plenty of power to tap into, though trying to muscle up led to him being too pull happy in high school, one of the main reasons for his struggle. The Pirates tend to preach hit over power in the Minors, so that should be a good fit.  The bat will have to play because he's an average defender with a fringy arm who is likely limited to left field as a pro. The good news is it looks like he's rediscovered his swing and should have the profile for an outfield corner spot in the future.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/yal8ZxNmuHI?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""COL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2017""","""Rancho Bernardo HS (CA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""PIT""","""pit""","""PIT""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,20,50,40,40,40,50,45,55,40,50,40,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,50,45,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The Pirates only got to see him play two games in the Gulf Coast League during his pro debut with a hamstring injury ending his summer after just seven at-bats.  Uselton did return to health in time to head to the organization's instructs in the Dominican Republic, where he was able to play for a couple of weeks before embarking on his offseason plan. The outfielder is more power over hit at this point, with some strength and leverage in his right-handed swing.

The North Georgia native struggled with the move to full-season ball in 2015, hitting just .231 with a Midwest League-leading 162 strikeouts at Class A Fort Wayne. Gettys fared much better in his return to Fort Wayne in 2016, however, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Midwest League before advancing to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in late June and finishing in the Arizona Fall League. Returning to the California League in 2017, Gettys continued to show loud tools but regressed overall as he finished as the circuit leader in both strikeouts (191) and strikeout rate (37.2 percent).  Gettys' swing is explosive and produces plus raw power that he can apply in games -- he hit a career-best 17 home runs in 2017 -- despite holes in his bat path and overall approach. He continues to strike out at a disconcerting rate, a product of his subpar pitch recognition and strike-zone management, and thus faces questions about the future utility of his hit tool. Plus speed allows Gettys to impact games on the basepaths as well as in center field, where he's a plus defender, with range for days and a cannon arm.  With raw power, speed, arm strength and defensive ability that all grade as average or better, Gettys has an undeniably impressive ceiling. The jury is still out on whether he can make the necessary swing adjustments to become an everyday player, but his speed, center-field defense and strong track record against left-handed pitching could still make him a valuable fourth outfielder.""",,,,,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,"""sd""","""SD""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",40,50,60,70,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Targeting his upside in the latter role, the Rays selected him in the fourth round in June and signed him for $367,500.

His slider can be inconsistent but has the makings of at least an above-average pitch, while further strides in developing his changeup could give Strotman a third Major League-average offering at maturity.

He almost immediately thrust himself into the discussion for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 Draft, but as that event approaches he's the most polarizing prospect in the class. Some teams believe in his lofty offensive ceiling and see him as a sure first-rounder, while other clubs question his ability to hit with wood and play a position.  His proponents point to Beer's production with the Tigers: .333/.506/.651 with 34 homers and more than twice as many walks (126) as strikeouts (62) in his first two years, with similar numbers in his third. Few college players can match his combination of strength and patience at the plate. For those sold that his left-handed power will play at the next level, it can be a carrying tool.  Beer's detractors don't like his less-than-smooth stroke and his wood-bat history, which includes some struggles on the high school showcase circuit and a .208/.344/.287 line in two years with Team USA. All of his value lies in his bat because he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner whose position options are first base and DH.

The southpaw opened the season on the 10-day disabled list with a left knee sprain.  What Merritt lacks in stuff he makes up for with pitchability and excellent command. The left-hander adds and subtracts from his upper-80s fastball and complements it with an above-average changeup.

Everything he throws plays up thanks to plus control and command that has helped him produce just 1.5 walks-per-nine nine innings in over 800 career frames in the Minors.

Givin's lean, athletic frame makes him one of the more projectable pitching prospects in Miami's system, with some club officials even comparing his overall profile to Zack Greinke.

He also was one of the best starters on the U.S. national collegiate team last summer, but his junior campaign ended early when he blew out his elbow in February and had Tommy John surgery.  Gingery's money pitch is a fading changeup that might be the best in the entire 2018 Draft crop. He has below-average fastball velocity, sitting at 88-92 mph and occasionally popping 94, yet the pitch is effective because it has quality sink and he can locate it on either side of the plate.

The Twins liked Pearson in the Draft, but the Angels got to him first, so they're happy to have his athleticism and offensive potential in the fold. There's a power-speed mix to tap into, with 20-20 potential if everything clicks. A left-handed hitter, Pearson utilizes a simple approach with good bat speed and an ability to backspin the ball when he's locked in, pointing to hitting for average and power.

New York has introduced him to a four-seamer to work the upper portion of the strike zone, and he has shown the ability to carry mid-90s velocity into the late innings. He also has a breaking ball with the power of a slider and the depth of a curveball, as well as a changeup that counteracts left-handers.   Whitlock showed decent control in college but has pounded the strike zone since turning pro. He's even more difficult to hit because he uses his 6-foot-5 frame to generate impressive extension, and a low-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and deception.

Longo is a toolsy college product with remaining upside. Hitting from an open stance, he creates leverage to the ball and keeps his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time.

He's an above-average runner who gets out of the box well and finished fourth in the Indians' system with 20 steals in 2017 despite limited action.   Longo's speed also plays well in right field, where he spent his entire full-season debut, and his above-average arm strength is a natural fit at the position.

His changeup is his best secondary pitch, a tick above average and he can mix in an effective slider and curve.

He returned to the Cal League in 2017, this time as full-time reliever, and promptly turned in a breakout campaign as part of a loaded Modesto bullpen. That success followed Warren to the Arizona Fall League, where he put a bow on his season by tossing 11 1/3 scoreless frames while closing games for the Peoria Javelinas.  Warren's stuff has ticked up out of the bullpen, where he'll operate with a 94-98 mph fastball that previously sat in the low-90s as a starter. The pitch has late life, which enables him to pitch effectively up in the zone, and he complements it with a hard, late-breaking slider that serves as a swing-and-miss out pitch, and a less-consistent curveball. Warren's changeup was a pitch he had focused on developing as a starter, though that has become a bit of a moot point after his move to the bullpen.   Warren's struggles in consistently repeating his high-effort delivery result in below-average control and too many free passes, some of which he's able to offset with his ability to induce whiffs.

At the plate, Barley, with a slight upstroke swing and decent bat speed, turns on the ball well and already shows game power at a young age. Though he struggled to make contact during his pro debut, Barley has made significant strides as a hitter since signing, and the Padres expect continued improvement on that front as he gains experience.  Barley's athleticism and speed translate to a quick first step at shortstop, where he displays good, soft hands and a strong arm. His footwork, body control and throwing accuracy can be inconsistent and resulted in 30 errors in 43 games in his debut.

Though Fernandez has enough raw power to hit at least 20 homers per season, he'll have to tone down his approach at the plate to get there. His left-handed swing is relatively sound but he's overly aggressive, resulting in a 29 percent strikeout rate last year. He could have a huge year in 2018 at high Class A Lancaster, perhaps the best hitting environment in the Minors, but his all-out mentality may lead to struggles at higher levels.    Fernandez possesses average speed out of the box, is a little quicker once he gets going and can steal an occasional base. He has enough arm strength to play right field, though he spent much of 2017 in left in deference to teammate Willie Abreu.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""10th rd 2016""","""UC Riverside""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""COL""",,"""COL""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,30,60,45,45,50,45,50,60,45,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",40,50,50,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He spent two summers in the Dominican Summer League and one in the Gulf Coast League before hitting full-season ball in 2016. He has yet to pitch above A ball and has topped 100 innings just once, in 2016, though a strong finish to his 2017 season, including a handful of relief appearances, were enough to convince the Cardinals to protect him on the 40-man roster.    Gonzalez will throw his fastball in the mid-90s and can reach back for more at times, especially in shorter stints, with average movement. His curveball is at least average, and flashes better than that, an effective breaking ball that he can use as an out pitch. He has a changeup, though it is below-average, as he learns how to change speeds effectively. He has a strong 6-foot-3 pitcher's frame that he is still learning to get in sync for a repeatable delivery. That leads to command issues, though he threw more strikes in Palm Beach in 2017.

It looked like they were starting to with a huge 2016 season in Double-A Reading's friendly ballpark, but while he still hit for power in the move to Triple-A in 2017, much of the rest of his offensive game went in the wrong direction.

He turned the trick again during his United States debut in 2016 and again in his full-season debut a year ago when he was dealt to the Phillies in the Pat Neshek trade last July.    Gomez doesn't have loud tools, but he does have a very good feel to hit, with low strikeout rates, that has led to a .312 career average heading into the 2018 season. He's continuing to work on adding strength, something he'll need so he can impact the baseball more consistently as he moves up the ladder. An average runner, Gomez is aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal, though he gets caught too frequently. He's moved all over the infield for much of his career to date and while he played more shortstop than anywhere else the last two seasons, the Phillies plan to go back to having him play there, second and third.    Gomez is the kind of player who won't wow you the first time you see him, but over time you'll notice his feel for the game and his ability to do the little things. Added strength will make him a more interesting prospect, but he at least can be a solid-hitting utilityman in the future.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ruujCc6loYI?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2013""","""Venezuela""","""July 2, 2013 - COL""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""PHI""",,"""PHI""","""|""",1,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,20,40,50,40,50,55,30,45,50,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,35,50,50,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He made his U.S. debut two years later with Seattle's Rookie-level Arizona League affiliate and advanced to Class A Short-Season in 2017, excelling in the second half after a slow start. It will now be up to the Marlins to further Torres' development after they acquired him, Nick Neidert and Robert Dugger in December in the Dee Gordon trade.   The switch-hitting Torres shows more impact potential from the left side of the plate, the side from which he hit five of his six Northwest League home runs (all coming during the second half). Equally impressive was his progress as a righty, especially considering there was talk about him scrapping switch-hitting prior to the season. Torres could hit for a solid average as well as some power with additional gains in each batter's box, while his above-average speed should net him plenty of doubles and triples as well as stolen bases.  On the other side of the ball, Torres draws raves for his upside at shortstop, where he projects as a plus defender with plenty of range and arm strength for the position. He also receives high marks for his intensity and leadership, both on and off the field. Torres will need time to develop, but the profile could be that of an everyday middle-infielder who contributes in all facets of the game.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/FmEjQsxE-rc?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""J2 2014""","""Dominican Republic""","""Aug. 21, 2014 - SEA""","""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIA""","""mia""","""MIA""","""|""",1,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",30,20,45,50,40,60,40,45,50,50,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,40,60,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

But he slumped as a junior at Arizona and fared better on the mound, leading all Division I pitchers with 41 strikeouts during the NCAA tournament and surrendering just two earned runs in two College World Series starts as the Wildcats finished second.

Dalbec has the most raw power in the Red Sox system -- even more than Michael Chavis, who ranked fifth in the Minors with 31 homers last year -- thanks to his strength, bat speed, loft in his right-handed stroke and take-no-prisoners approach. He kept his aggressiveness in check during his debut, using the middle of the field and letting pitches travel deep, but tried to do too much while making up for lost time last year and struck out in a whopping 37 percent of his plate appearances. He has holes in his swing and always will rack up a lot of whiffs, but he'll need to be more disciplined to tap into it.  Though Dalbec lacks speed, he has a surprisingly quick first step and has worked to add range at third base. He should be an average defender there once he improves his consistency.

The Rockies decided to shift him from starter to reliever when he returned to the mound this season, and the initial results in low Class A were encouraging.  Tyler could sit in the mid-90s with his fastball while working in the rotation and pitches at 96-99 mph coming out of the bullpen. Besides its overpowering velocity, his heater also features run, sink and downhill plane that make it tough to square up. His second-best pitch is a changeup with sink and fade that's a plus offering at times.  Tyler has struggled to come up with a reliable breaking ball and currently employs a knuckle-curve.

That effort netted them Tyler Glasnow, who is trying to establish himself as a big leaguer, in the fifth round, and Holmes, who signed for $1.2 million, in the ninth. Tommy John surgery forced Holmes to miss all of 2014 and most of 2015, though he's knocking on the door to join Glasnow in Pittsburgh.  Throughout his career, Holmes has been an extreme groundball machine, with a 2.27 groundout-to-airout ratio that has gone up in his two full years since returning from elbow surgery. He gets all of that weak contact with his heavy power sinking fastball, thrown in the low 90s. He throws a solid changeup and will flash an average curveball at times, though he still doesn't command consistently. Holmes added a 90-91 mph cutter with slider action that was very effective against left-handed hitters in 2017 and allows his fastball to play up more, though he doesn't miss a ton of bats.  There has been talk about moving Holmes to the bullpen, where that sinker-cutter combination could be extremely effective.

Garcia's outstanding bat speed and strength give him top-of-the-scale raw power, though it remains to be seen how much he'll be able to tap into it against more advanced pitching. He still has trouble with recognizing pitches and handling offspeed offerings, and he has yet to prove he can make consistent contact. He has displayed a willingness to accept walks, though he still chases pitches out of the strike zone with alarming frequency.  Garcia has to deliver on his power potential because almost all of his value comes from his bat.

High, Rizzo proved a divisive 2016 Draft prospect due to his lack of size as well as concerns surrounding his future position. The Mariners, however, were thrilled to find him still on the board in the second round, as they selected Rizzo with the No. 50 overall pick and then signed him for more than slot value at $1,750,000. Assigned to Class A Clinton for his first full season, Rizzo held his own in the Midwest League at age 19 before advancing to Class A Advanced Modesto late in the season. His bat came alive at the more advanced level, as Rizzo erupted to hit .421 in the postseason to garner honors as the California League Championship Series MVP.  Rizzo shows feel to hit from the left side, with good bat speed and hand-eye coordination as well as a discernable eye. Club officials believe he'll develop into an above-average hitter with at least average power, though a penchant for swinging and missing has resulted in little pop early in his career. Whereas some scouts believe Rizzo can become an adequate third baseman, others feel he's destined for first base or left field, where his below-average speed and average arm strength would be less of an issue. Rizzo is thickly built and doesn't require much physical projection, so he will need to focus on conditioning and adding good strength to his 5-foot-9 frame in future seasons.   Beyond Rizzo's physical tools, the Mariners rave about the makeup and baseball IQ, noting that it has already helped him to overcome adversity as a professional. He has many gains to make on both sides of the ball and is likely to move down the defensive spectrum, but the potential is there for him to develop into an everyday player.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VU5-CG99f8E?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""BAL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2016""","""Oakton HS (VA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""SEA""","""sea""","""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",35,20,45,30,30,50,60,40,45,30,40,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,45,40,50,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Hinojosa has fared better in pro ball because he shortened his right-handed swing and stopped worrying about hitting home runs. He has a quick bat and makes contact more easily than any Giants farmhand, though that also cuts into his walk totals. He uses the entire field, has some gap power and can hit an occasional homer to his pull side.  Though he's a well-below-average runner who lacks the quickness to play shortstop, Hinojosa manages to make plays there thanks to his solid arm and good internal clock.

After being asked to serve pitches to the opposite field by his college coaches, O'Hearn now just worries about hammering the ball. His strength and leverage create above-average raw power and allow him to drive pitches out of the park to all fields. Strikeouts are part of the package because he has a long left-handed swing and an aggressive approach, though he will take walks when opponents try to pitch around him.

Though Hernandez likely will need time to refine his all-around game and come into his own as a player, he has the raw tools needed to develop into a Major Leaguer.

He was back in the Majors with the Mariners on three separate occasions in 2017, but otherwise spent much of the season in Triple-A.

Further complicating Vogelbach's profile is his inability to hit same-sided pitching, something he did at a .234/.290/.328 clip over 138 plate appearances in 2017.   As a bottom-of-the-scale runner and a well-below-average defender at first base, Vogelbach's value is tied to his offensive output.

He missed the first 50 games in 2017 because of a suspension for testing positive for a stimulant, then posted the worst OPS of his career (.607) in his first exposure to low Class A before recording his best OPS yet (.704) in the short-season New York-Penn League.  Arauz's modest statistical performance thus far is a result of being much younger than his competition and not a knock on his offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter with discipline and a propensity for making line-drive contact. His quick hands hint at untapped power, and he could produce double-digit home run totals as he adds strength and starts using his lower half more often in his swing.  Though he's just an average runner, Arauz has a quick first step and good range that may enable him to stay at shortstop. His solid arm works at short and enables him to play all over the infield should he become a utilityman.

The Braves didn't add him to the 40-man roster, but he was not selected in last December's Rule 5 Draft.    While his 2017 season was a disappointment, there were some positive signs, including a reduced strikeout rate and a strong August that saw him hit .316/.393/.481, numbers that perhaps can be used as a springboard. He was adjusting to the Braves' approach to hitting, and the organization thinks there's more pure hit tool than he's shown. The raw power is legit, and if he can make more consistent contact, it will show up in games more often.    Demerirtte has already shown he can be an excellent defender at second and has more than enough arm for third.

Of the trio, it is Alcantara who is a sure-fire shortstop, though it's unclear if he'll hit enough to be an everyday one at the big league level.  There are no questions about Alcantara's ability to defend, however. He can flat out play the premium position with an easily plus arm and excellent hands. While he's an average runner at best, he has enough range thanks to his instincts and a terrific first step. His defense is so highly regarded, he was the regular shortstop for Licey in the Domincan Winter League this offseason. At the plate, Alcantara does put the ball in play, keeping his strikeouts down, and will even draw some walks.

He struggled out of the gate during his debut in the New York-Penn League, showing there's work to be done.  Rivera has legitimate raw power, but the question is whether he'll be able to make the adjustments necessary to tap into it consistently. The mechanics of his swing led to him having trouble with balls on the inner part of the plate and a fair amount of swings and misses as a result. He'll have to smooth out those rough edges to become a serious offensive threat from the left side of the plate. Largely a first baseman at Chipola, the Tigers had the Puerto Rico native play a lot of right field during his debut. He'll continue to play both spots in 2018, likely more at first, but it's hard to walk away from his strong arm in an outfield corner.

Matijevic got away from his normal approach in his introduction to pro ball and the Astros believe he'll hit for average and power once he reverts to what worked for him in the past. He needs to work counts better and focus on making hard contact. His pop should come naturally because he's strong and his left-handed swing creates plenty of bat speed and loft.

He stood out most for his offensive potential as an amateur, but as is the case with so many prep catchers, his bat has lagged behind his defense in the professional ranks. A hand injury sustained in June 2016 affected Ciuffo's development on both sides of the ball, but he returned fully healthy in '17 to enjoy his best all-around season, all of which he spent in Double-A. Left off the Rays' 40-man roster after the season, Ciuffo received a 50-game suspension in February after his second positive test for a drug of abuse.  The Rays' defensive player of the year in back-to-back years, Ciuffo has made considerable strides in improving his blocking and receiving since signing. His plus arm strength and advanced catch-and-throw skills help him control the running game, a notion supported by his career caught-stealing rate of 46 percent in 263 games behind the plate. Meanwhile, club officials are quick to praise Ciuffo's leadership qualities and feel for handling a staff, even in the wake of his suspension.   Ciuffo is less advanced from the left side of the plate, where he employs an up-the-middle approach and produces good bat speed. He did a better job controlling the strike zone in 2017 and had his walk rate jump to a full-season best 10.1 percent as a result. Ciuffo also began to tap into some of his raw power, as his seven home runs surpassed his career total (five) from his previous 253 games spanning four seasons. Even if Ciuffo's bat is merely average, he still stands to carve out a role as at least a big league backup based on his defensive merits.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/-KELTvpMYp4?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""ATL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""1st rd 2013""","""Lexington HS (SC)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TBR""",,"""TB""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",45,40,55,20,50,55,50,45,55,20,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,40,30,60,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Overall, Franco's approach is advanced for his age, providing him with a solid foundation for offensive growth.

He had impressed the Dodgers on the showcase circuit, and they popped him in the fifth round and paid him second-round money ($918,600). He spent most of his first two full pro seasons in low Class A and came to the Rangers in the Yu Darvish trade last July.   Davis remains highly projectable three years after that trait led Los Angeles to draft him.

He made his big league debut in April 2017 in the wake of Adam Eaton's season-ending injury, though Bautista's season as a whole was one of disappointment as he batted .160 over three big league stints, struggled in Triple-A and missed time with a hamstring injury along the way. Injuries plagued Bautista once again in 2018, when a torn ACL, LCL and meniscus suffered while in Triple-A effectively ended his season in May.     Bautista's double-plus speed is easily his top tool and gives him impact potential on both sides of the ball. He's always a threat to run when on base, as his track record indicates, though he did regress on that front in 2017 at Triple-A, swiping just nine bags in 14 attempts. He shows solid contact skills from the right side, where he looks to slash the ball and let his speed take over, and he's long been a skilled bunter who knows how to work counts. Power will never be a part of Bautista's game, as he's totaled just 12 home runs over 537 Minor League games spanning seven seasons.    Defensively, Bautista gets good reads off the bat and has range for days in center field.

The Blue Jays preferred Danner in the latter role, drafting him in the second round and then signing him for close to $500,000 above slot value. But after a pro debut that saw him hit just .160 with a 26.5 percent strikeout rate over 34 games in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, the jury is still out regarding Danner's positional future.   Danner is raw behind the plate but has the chance to be a special catcher. He has good hands and a plus arm defensively -- he was up to 94-95 mph on the mound as a prep -- and while he's a below-average runner, his athleticism helps him move well behind the dish. He swings the bat well from a crouch set up, with quiet pop that could end up being average power in the future, but he'll need to distance himself from his current pull-heavy approach to be successful against pro arms.   The one thing scouts agree on is that Danner's grades will improve now that he's focused solely on catching and hitting. At the same time, Danner's pro debut indicated that he would need considerable time to refine his game on both sides of the ball. At the worst, Danner's power arm represents an interesting fallback option should he have trouble sticking as a catcher.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/zOSvxofwJBY?autoplay=1""",,"""|""","""MIL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,"""2nd rd 2017""","""Huntington Beach HS (CA)""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""TOR""",,"""TOR""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",20,30,55,50,40,60,40,50,60,40,50,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,45,30,60,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

After a 15-month absence, the big right-hander finally returned to the mound in July 2017 in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he issued 14 walks in just 3 2/3 innings.

He throws his heater with heavy sinking action that leads to many groundouts and few home runs.

He did make some strides with the former before getting hurt, throwing it with improved depth and power.  The Marlins worked with Kolek to refine his delivery during his rehab process with the hope that it would help him regain some velocity, as well as better command. Unhappy with those results, they will now attempt to further simplify his delivery.

Hall made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he tallied six hits in nine at-bats before an oblique injury prematurely ended his season.   Hall might be a bit unpolished, but he has considerable tools and upside. He has a decent approach at the plate for his age and experience level, with a natural feel to hit and good bat speed. There should be some gap power in the future as well, and he should compile plenty of doubles and triples thanks to his plus speed and sharp baserunning. Hall is capable of making the spectacular play defensively, and while his arm might grade out as average, he can reach back for more when needed and he's usually very accurate.

He spent the next four seasons refining his craft in Rookie ball before joining the Yankees via the Minor League phase in the 2015 Rule 5 Draft.

He improved in each of his three seasons with the Fighting Irish, ultimately earning a $300,000 signing bonus as the Blue Jays' fifth-round pick in 2016. After an up-and-down first full season in the Class A Advanced Florida State League, Biggio emerged as a rising prospect in Toronto's system in 2018 behind a torrid start to his first Double-A campaign.   Biggio's offensive game is built around his plus plate discipline and approach, as he's long showed a knack for drawing walks and getting on base at a high clip. He has natural hitting ability from the left side of the plate, with feel for the barrel that encourages his use of the entire field, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. An adjustment to Biggio's hands in his stance has enabled him to hit the ball in the air more consistently and tap into his raw power, and it took him just 33 Double-A games in 2018 to surpass his career-high home run total from the previous year.  That Biggio's primary position is second base adds even more value to his offensive profile. He's a solid if unspectacular defender there, making up for modest range with sure-handedness, sound footwork and good instincts.

Other college hitters in the area may have passed him, but he was coming on strong as the Draft approached.    Keirsey has excellent bat to ball skills and makes consistent hard contact. It's more of a line drive approach at present, though the left-handed hitter has some extra-base thump. While he might run into a few homers along the way, he's definitely an average over power kind of hitter. Before the injury, Keirsey's athleticism and speed were by far his best tool, with some putting a 70 on his run tool.

He missed nearly six weeks with a right thumb injury during his full-season debut and underwent surgery to repair a broken hamate bone in his left hand that fall. Though healthy for all of 2016, Reyes was overmatched as the youngest everyday player in the Class A Advanced Carolina League.

Reyes generates plus raw power from the right side of the plate with his above-average bat speed and natural feel for driving the ball to all fields.

There are questions about his ability to hit for average, though Orioles club officials were pleased with the mechanical adjustments he made late in the season and then during fall instructional league.   Reyes has improved his glove work and has the plus arm strength needed for third base, but as a well-below-average runner who will only get bigger, it might be a challenge for him to remain at the position.

He can be overly aggressive at times in the box, but overall he has a good approach and controls the strike zone well.    Pentecost's blend of athleticism and tools still gives him upside as a catcher, and he's looked fine back there in limited action since returning the field. However, he has yet to appear in back-to-back games at the position, a challenge he'll obviously need to overcome soon. Should Pentecost not stick behind the plate, his bat could also make him a fit in left field or at first base.""",,,,,"""|""","""TAM""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,"""tor""","""TOR""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,45,45,55,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He made his pro debut in the United States, in the Gulf Coast League in 2015, and has been making incremental progress in sharpening his considerable raw tools since, reaching full-season ball for the first time in 2017.  Wilson was a shortstop as an amateur, but the Braves moved him to the outfield right after he signed and he took to it immediately, with the range and instincts to stay in center and enough arm to play right, seeing time in both spots so far. He's made strides in his overall approach at the plate and could eventually be close to an average power, which will help him tap into considerable raw power, especially as he continues to add strength. Wilson has worked to be more than the pure pull hitter he was when he started, learning to use the middle of the field. The in-game power he has displayed is still to the pull side, but he should be able to drive the ball to all fields in time.

The Rockies were encouraged by the progress he was making in Spring Training last year until he injured his elbow and required Tommy John surgery that cost him the entire 2017 season.    Before he got hurt, Nikorak was throwing in the mid-90s with a simplified delivery. When he's at his best, he can throw two-seam fastballs in the low 90s with sink, four-seamers that reach 98 mph, spin a hammer curveball and even flash a plus changeup. During his first two pro seasons, however, he often worked with a fastball sitting around 90 mph and diminished secondary pitches.    Nikorak has trouble keeping his delivery in sync and maintaining a consistent arm slot, leading him to pitch tentatively and lose the strike zone. He did make some improvements in 2016 and more last spring, and the Rockies thought he was on the verge of a breakthrough before his elbow gave out.

With enough arm and instincts, Ward has the chance to stay in center long-term, unless he fills out his 6-foot-5 frame too much, in which case he could fit a corner outfield profile from a power perspective just fine.

A physically strong left-handed hitter, Noda generates above-average raw power with his combination of strength and bat speed, and impressed with his ability to drive the ball out of the park to the opposite field during his pro debut. His patient approach continues to result in elevated strikeout totals but also fuels his on-base skills, as Noda's 59 walks were far and way the most among Appy League hitters. Whether Noda will hit for average remains a divisive topic among evaluators.  Primarily a first baseman at Cincinnati, Noda continued to receive the bulk of his playing time there during his pro debut.

A move to second might work, with others suggesting third or left field, where his arm would probably play up to average.

He honored his commitment to Nebraska and turned in three strong seasons for the Huskers before the Rays made him the highest-drafted position player to come out of the program since Alex Gordon in 2005 by selecting him in the second round of the 2016 Draft.  After making his pro debut in the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League, Boldt made the jump straight to Class A Advanced Charlotte in 2017 and impressed over a full season in the Florida State League, where he ranked among the circuit leaders with a .295 average (third), 130 hits (third) and 23 steals (eighth). His left-handed swing has a level plane that helps him use the entire field and deliver power to the gaps, and club officials believe he'll eventually develop some over-the-fence power as he gains experience and adds more strength to his projectable frame. Boldt has good speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school, though he did make noticeable gains with his basestealing technique and reading pitchers in '17.   Boldt can hold his own in center field, where he gets good jumps and takes efficient routes on fly balls, but he likely profiles better at an outfield corner long-term. He's seen time at all three spots early in his career, portending a potential career as a fourth or fifth outfielder in the big leagues.""",,,,,"""|""","""MIA""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""TB""","""|""",1,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",50,40,55,50,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

That prompted to a full-time move to the bullpen as in junior in 2017, a role in which Marks thrived. He struck out 100 batters and yielded just 29 hits in 59 1/3 innings to lead all Division I hurlers in both strikeouts-per-nine (15.17) and hits-per-nine (4.40). That overwhelming success earned him a 13th-round selection by the A's in June, and after signing for $110,000, Marks continued to miss bats with ease across two levels in his pro debut.   Marks gets the most out of his two above-average pitches, missing bats inside and outside of the zone easily with each. He won't shy away from challenging hitters up in the zone with his low-90s fastball that he can also spot to both sides of the plate. His curveball is a hammer when it's on, registering in the low 80s with tight spin, and it serves as an ideal bat-missing complement to his fastball. Marks has a strong track record as a strike-thrower, but he'll need to improve his fastball command for continued success at higher levels.  Though he started seven of his 13 games during his pro debut, Marks' future is in the bullpen.

He was traded once again in March the following year, this time going to the Mariners in exchange for Drew Jackson and Aneurys Zabala. Though De Jong would ultimately crack Seattle's Opening Day roster and make his Major League debut on April 5, the right-hander scuffled on the season overall, posting a 6.35 ERA in seven outings with the Mariners, and a 5.99 ERA over 20 starts across the Double- and Triple-A levels.   De Jong compensates for a lack of stuff by showing good feel for a four-pitch mix. His curveball is his lone above-average pitch, and he throws it good downer action. His four-seam fastball has below-average velocity, usually sitting at 88-92 mph, but it tends to play up thanks to the extension in his delivery. He also mixes in a fringy cutter and changeup.

The Clemson product went in the second round as a result, then saw his prospect stock plummet with a dreadful first full season in 2017.    A natural leader who prides himself on being tough behind the plate, it turned out Okey had hid a right hand and wrist injury from the organization, self-treating it at night and playing through it. It clearly impacted his hitting as he batted only .185 and slugged .265. The Reds are hoping he can get back to the average hitter that he was pre-injury, one with some power to tap into. While he couldn't handle the bat, Okey did impress the organization with his defensive play. He's great working with pitchers, calling a good game to go along with solid blocking and receiving skills. His throwing has improved, and he's thrown out just over 33 percent of potential base stealers in his career heading into 2018.

Richards may pitch with a tick below average velocity, usually sitting 90-92 mph, but his fastball plays up because he creates a good downhill angle to the plate with a deceptive delivery and locates it well. His changeup is above average, features good velocity separation and is effective against hitters on both sides of the plate. A fringy curveball gives Richards a third pitch that club officials say improved in his first full season.  Richards gets the most out of his three-pitch mix because he's a consistent strike-thrower who has feel for changing speeds and keeping hitters off balance.

Finally healthy, he has broken out in a big way in 2018, leading NCAA Division I in slugging (.944) and OPS (1.456) and all D-I Draft-eligible players in homers (22) through the end of the regular season.  Spillane's 6-foot-5, 210-pound build gives him strength and leverage, which combined with his solid bat speed produces prodigious raw power. A right-handed hitter, he excels at crushing the balls to the opposite field, though some scouts wonder how he'll have the same success against quality inside fastballs in pro ball. His size adds length to his swing and his aggressiveness leads to strikeouts, so he'll hit more for power than average at the next level.

While Brodey doesn't possess any plus tools, he can do a number of things well.

Davis was a surprise part of the big league rotation at the start of the season, but was struck by a line drive early on. He had dealt with a groin injury in 2016 and then had a back strain in 2017.

If healthy, the hope is Davis can return to being able to extend fully out front and get the most out of his stuff. An inability to do so has forced his velocity of his slightly above-average fastball to fluctuate. He used to have a plus curveball, but that lack of extension caused that to vanish as well.

Know more for his hitting ability and power that produced a .904 OPS with 29 home runs in three seasons with the Beavers, Harrison intrigued teams in the 2017 Draft with his upside as a bat-first catcher. Hoping that his defense would develop, the Brewers drafted Harrison in the third round and signed him for pick value. And while he was raw as expected behind the plate during his pro debut, Harrison still made a statement with his bat by connecting on 10 home runs and slugging .546 across 48 games in the Rookie-level Pioneer League.   Harrison showed the ability to hit for average and power at times for the Beavers, reaching double digits in home runs as both a freshman and sophomore. He added nine more homers as a junior while showing a more refined approach at the plate that carried over into his pro debut. Harrison's penchant for striking out raises questions about the future utility of his bat, though that figures to be a lesser issue so long as he continues to hit for power.   Harrison caught a few times as a junior, but not enough for teams to have a real comfort level with how he looks back there. The Brewers, however, are willing to give him a chance behind the plate, though it's fair to wonder if it might slow down his advanced bat too much. Being able to remain there would obviously increase his value, but it's his bat that will have to carry him to the Major Leagues.""",,,"""http://www.youtube.com/embed/z-yadgX651I?autoplay=1""",,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,"""3rd rd 2017""","""Oregon State""",,"""|""",,,,,"""|""","""MIL""","""mil""","""MIL""","""|""",0,0,1,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",25,30,55,30,30,45,40,50,60,30,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,50,30,50,45,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Johnson has a tremendous toolbox to work with and they were sharpening as the spring wore on. The right-handed hitter managed just a .218 average as a freshman, but has improved markedly since then, showing the ability to impact the baseball consistently. The better he's gotten at getting the barrel to the ball, the more his raw power is showing up in games, and he was clearing fences a lot more as the Draft approached. At one point, it seemed like Johnson might need to move to an outfield corner, but his defense has improved to the point where most see him staying on the dirt. Some might even send him out as a shortstop, with moves to third or second a possibility as well.    Committed to Cal State Fullerton, Johnson is the kind of toolsy player that can be polarizing, with some buzz about him going as high as the end of the second round along with some teams viewing him more as a fifth or sixth-round pick.""",,,"""|""",,,,"""|""","""MIA""",53,,,,"""|""","""Encinal HS CA""","""Fullerton""","""Encinal (Calif.)

In Gordon's case, hockey was the other sport, but the Canadian gave up the ice in high school to focus on the diamond. He improved enough to catch the Reds' eye and was taken in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft. A repeat of the Pioneer League in '17, after a '16 campaign that was interrupted by a shoulder injury, led to a bit of a breakout for the young outfielder.    Gordon's raw tools started to come into focus in 2017, and he hit for both average and extra-base power. The left-handed hitter has largely had a pull-oriented approach at the plate, and that's where most of his pop has come, though he is quick to the ball and showed solid plate discipline last season. An above-average runner, Gordon has played all three outfield spots in his career, focusing on right and center in '17. He has the skills to play up the middle regularly, but the Reds' depth at that spot could push him to a corner.    Just 20 for all of the 2018 season, Gordon will show what he can do in full-season ball for the first time.

Mahan's breakout campaign in college baseball's best league stood out in a thin crop of college hitters, and the Marlins were thrilled to find him still on the board in the third round. He made his pro debut with Class A Greensboro, though a groin injury limited him to just six games.   Mahan has a nice left-handed swing, shows good feel for the barrel and drives the ball across the entire field.

An above-average runner, he moves well once underway but doesn't figure to be a stolen-base threat.   Defensively, Mahan has looked comfortable at second base after previously struggling as a shortstop.

Perez's strength gives him plenty of raw power to all fields, and he did a good job of translating it into game production early last year. When he got tired, his right-handed stroke got longer and he expanded his strike zone. The Rangers believe that with better conditioning, he'll get back to the compact swing and approach he showed in low Class A and hit for both power and average.  After playing third base, second base, first base, right field and left field in Cuba, Perez spent time at all of those positions except for second base in his pro debut. The best-case scenario would be the hot corner, where he has a strong arm but so-so range and is prone to errors, but right field is more realistic and first base is the fallback.

Making the jump to Class A Advanced Stockton for his first full season, Ramirez garnered midseason All-Star honors in the California League before advancing to Double-A, where his bat and glove helped the RockHounds secure a Texas League title. Altogether, he finished first among A's farmhands in walks (73) and on-base percentage (.398), second in hits (148) and third in runs scored (tied-80) and batting average (.304).

He's adept at driving the ball to all fields from the left side of the plate and shows more power in the gaps than true over-the-fence pop despite totaling 11 homers in his full-season debut. A feel for controlling the strike zone leads to plenty of walks and fuels Ramirez's strong on-base skills, but he also leaves a lot of outcomes on the table with his penchant for striking out. On the other side of the ball, Ramirez is an average runner but an above-average defender at all three outfield spots -- a distinction that earned him a Minor League Gold Glove Award in 2017.

He changed that perception in 2016 with a breakout performance at age 24 in the Florida State League, and then he held his own the following year over a full season in the Double-A Eastern League before a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League.    Though he stands a diminutive 5-foot-8, Davis has excellent strength for his size and creates above-average bat speed from the right side. The result is sneaky power to all fields, though he does most of his damage to the pull side. That he finished third in walks in both the FSL and EL in back-to-back years highlights his ability to control the strike zone and work deep counts, although his patient approach does lead to some swing-and-miss. Davis' on-base skills also help him contribute on the basepaths, where his plus speed makes him a threat to steal 15-plus bases annually.    Davis spent much of his time between the outfield corners before shifting to center field in 2017. Though he took quickly to the position and made overall strides as a defender in the process, he's likely to be a better long-term fit in left field on account of his below-average arm.

Thought to be a potential top 10 pick in the 2016 Draft, he slid after a positive test for a performance-enhancer. The Cardinals took a chance and drafted him closer to the end of that first round, but while he did show some tools during his pro debut that summer, he struggled in 2017 and his summer ended with a broken hand in early August.  That's the bad news. The good news is the shortstop had a productive offseason once his hand healed. That included playing for Team Puerto Rico, and manager Yadier Molina, in the Pan American U-23 Baseball Championship to earn a spot in next fall's World Cup. In addition to getting him more playing time, the Cardinals wanted to make sure he worked on getting more physical. Perez has solid bat-to-ball skills and drew some walks, even when struggling, but a serious lack of strength kept him from impacting the baseball. Some evaluators worry he won't be able to add the strength necessary to hit, but the Cardinals see strength in his hands and forearms and think his build will allow him to add good weight.  There's no question about Perez's defense. He has plus speed and outstanding range as a result, to go along with above-average hands and a plus arm when he needs to.

His ability to play up the middle defensively and control the strike zone offensively interested the Pirates enough to take him in the third round of the 2016 Draft. While a thumb injury kept him out of a large chunk of his first full season, he was able to make his way from A ball to the Class A Advanced Florida State League.  Despite the missed time, Alemais has shown a bit more bat than expected when he was coming out of Tulane. He has good feel to hit and recognizes pitches well and if he stays within his approach, he has the chance to be a Major League average hitter. Though power isn't a big part of his game, he does occasionally get too big and try to leave the yard, something he didn't do when he moved up to Bradenton in 2017. He has very good hands at shortstop, with solid range, plus instincts and at least a solid average arm, meaning he can play shortstop full time in the future.  Alemais was drafted by Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League this offseason and the infielder was able to work out with the team for a spell.

That Jorge did not pitch particularly well in the big leagues, or during his time in Triple-A, speaks to an issue about his lack of pure stuff to get upper level hitters out. He's an extreme strike-thrower with a career 2.2 walks per nine ratio in his Minor League career, but there is concern he doesn't have the weapons to miss enough bats in the big leagues. He will throw his fastball anywhere in the 90-95 mph range and the Twins think he could throw harder more consistently if he employed his lower half better and have more extension in his delivery.

Detroit sent him to Tampa for Mikie Mahtook in the spring and the Rays shipped Smith to the Mets at the Trade Deadline last July in the Lucas Duda trade.    Smith relies mostly on his fastball-curveball combination in short relief. His heater will sit comfortably in the mid-90s, and he can reach back for more, all from a clean and easy delivery.

Smith doesn't throw his changeup enough, and he'll need to improve his feel for the pitch and use it more in the future, though he did make strides as a strike-thrower in his second full season as he stayed healthy.

The White Sox thought he could reach the big leagues quickly after drafting him in the third round that spring and he did, requiring just 107 innings in the Minors. However, he had to have his elbow reconstructed a second time and moved from the rotation to the bullpen before arriving in Chicago last September.    As a starter, Fry was a finesse left-hander whose solid control was his best attribute. Since becoming a reliever he has added about three mph to his fastball, which now sits at 92-94 mph and induces a lot of grounders. His secondary pitches gained some power as well, and there are times when his slider/cutter is his most effective offering.    Fry also throws a curveball that he sometimes has trouble landing in the strike zone, as well as a changeup he employs to keep right-handers honest.

Machado sits at 92-95 mph and tops out at 97 with riding life on his four-seam fastball. His changeup shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch but also can get too firm at times and couldn't prevent left-handers from batting .300/.365/.525 against him last year. His mid-80s slider features more velocity than tilt and got hammered during his brief time in the big leagues, when he surrendered nine runs and got 11 outs.  Machado's walk rate dropped from 4.7 per nine innings before he had his elbow reconstructed to 2.6 in the first two years afterward. While he's providing more strikes, his command lags behind his control and his delivery lacks deception, so he's fairly hittable.

Norwood generates big pull-side raw power with his strong core and quick bat. He sells out for it too often, though, pulling off the ball with a long swing that limits his use of the opposite field and results in too many strikeouts.

Ignored in the Rule 5 Draft, Sherriff finally got added to the roster and called up to the big leagues for the first time in August of last year.    It was an opportunity well-earned and Sherriff largely did what he was supposed to do, keeping left-handed hitters to a .080 batting average over 25 at-bats. That should come as no surprise, given he'd kept lefties to averages under .200 in Triple-A the last two seasons. Sherriff comes at hitters with a funky arm angle that brings in fastballs up to 93-94 mph and thrown with a ton of sink that gets a lot of groundball outs. He complements that with a very good slider, which when coming from his lower arm slot, is death to lefties.    This has the chance to be one of those outstanding player development stories of perseverance.

He's a strike-thrower, but not quite with the precision Eshelman or Seabold showed during their days anchoring the Titans rotation.     Eastman missed a good chunk of his sophomore season with elbow inflammation and has not pitched over the summer in either of the past two years. He's shown no ill effects this year, though, and a team that believes he could have two above-average secondary offerings to go along with his feel for pitching could snag him early as a back-end starter type who could move quickly.""",,,"""|""",,,,"""|""","""PHI""",107,,,,"""|""","""Fullerton""","""""","""Cal State Fullerton""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""","""""","""""","""++""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",50,55,50,,,,,50

He opened his freshman season as a midweek starter before becoming a dominating closer in April and playing a key role in the Tigers' runner-up finish at the College World Series. He moved into the weekend rotation this spring to fill a need, and though most scouts still envision him as a reliever, he's talented enough to go in the first three rounds as a Draft-eligible sophomore.  As a starter, Hess usually works with a 91-95 mph fastball and a solid slider. When he came out of the bullpen last year, he repeatedly ran his heater into upper 90s and backed it up with a wipeout slider. He uses his low-three-quarters arm slot and 6-foot-6 frame to create angle and life that make both pitches difficult to contend with.   Hess has yet to show much aptitude for a changeup, but also hasn't really needed one yet. He has toned down his delivery some but still throws with effort, and his arm action and fringy control may have him ticketed for the bullpen in pro ball.

He instead signed with the Blue Jays in September, and did so for just $10,000. Castillo made both his pro debut and U.S. debut the next year and then in 2017 advanced to Rookie-level Bluefield, where, at age 18, he won six of his 10 starts and posted strikeout and walk rates of 26.0 and 3.5 percent, respectively.    Castillo is already physically mature for his age, with a stocky frame that leaves little room for projection. His feel for pitching is similarly advanced, as Castillo operates at 89-92 mph with a fastball that has run and late sinking action that nets him both whiffs and ground balls. Castillo can spin a solid breaking ball but does so inconsistently, while a changeup gives him a distinct third pitch.

Velocity-wise, Woodford's fastball is about average, with a four-seamer that tops out at around 94 mph, but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. His changeup is solid average and his slider, while inconsistent, might get to Major League average as well. But more than anything, Woodford is a strike-throwing groundball pitcher, one who is efficient with his pitches and able to log innings when he's at his best.

While Walls didn't hit for average in his junior year, he did as a sophomore, capping that year with a solid performance for Team USA. His best offensive skill is his plate discipline, as Walls compiled more walks (178) than strikeouts (145) during his 196-game Seminoles career. He's a switch-hitter who grinds out at-bats, with a line-drive approach and some extra-base ability, albeit with little over-the-fence power.

The fact he had moved to the Class A Advanced Florida State League in 2017 really put him ahead of that curve, though he struggled there, with his season ending a bit early due to a scapula stress fracture. His future became even more clouded when open heart surgery to repair a faulty valve ended his season, though the Pirates are optimistic he'll be ready to go in 2019.    It's unclear how long he had been dealing with the shoulder injury, which could have impacted his overall performance in Bradenton in 2017. He's still a bit of a project, but there are the makings of a three-pitch mix in an excellent pitching frame. He's a physical power pitcher who sits close to the mid-90s with his fastball. When he's right, he throws with sink to get ground-ball outs. He's continuing to develop his secondary stuff, with a good feel to spin a power curveball and a changeup that is a work in progress. He throws strikes, but gets too much of the zone at times, leading to elevated hit rates.

Naughton's stuff is largely average across the board, though movement and deception in his delivery allow it to play up.

He backed that up by pitching most of his first full season of pro ball in Double-A after the Pirates took him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. A combination of so-so performance and injuries have caused him to stall a bit.  Waddell does have a good feel to pitch and knows how to move the ball around the zone. But he tends to nibble too much and work off the plate, leading to a much higher walk rate than is desirable from a finesse lefty. He has average stuff across the board, with a fastball that sits around 90-91 mph and works best when he keeps it down in the zone to get groundball outs, an average slider and a changeup that usually has good fade to it. The Pirates have preached to him about being more efficient and force contact earlier in counts because he is not overly physical and long innings will make it harder for him to hold up as a starter. He did have two disabled list stints with a forearm strain in 2017.  Waddell made up for some lost innings and pitched largely in relief in the Arizona Fall League, throwing better during that limited stretch.

What Walton lacks in tools he makes up for with excellent instincts and all-around consistency. He's a capable switch-hitter but does most of his damage from the left side, showing good bat speed and feel to hit as well as surprising power given his size. His average speed plays up on the basepaths due to his aforementioned instincts, and he's adept at reading pitchers and picking his spots to run.    Defensively, Walton saw more time at shortstop than second base in 2017, though most scouts view him as a second baseman long term because he has below-average arm strength.

However, shoulder fatigue combined with a team-imposed inning cap limited the right-hander to just five starts with the Braves, who then sent him and Max Povse to the Mariners for '14 first-rounder Alex Jackson in late November. He returned to the big leagues in 2017 with Seattle, but also missed considerable time with leg and knee injuries early in the season before taking the rest of the year off in July to address mental health issues.  Whalen pitches with an average fastball, sitting at 90-93 mph, but it plays up thanks to heavy sinking action that yields a high number of ground balls. His curveball is his lone above-average pitch, and he also mixes in a slider and a usable changeup. The right-hander is around the strike zone with all of his pitches and knows how to keep hitters off balance and guessing by effectively changing speeds.  With an advanced feel for four pitches as well as a bulldog mentality on the mound, Whalen shows the makings of becoming a backend starter at maturity.

Young relies on a three-pitch mix and his ability to throw them for strikes, rather than any one true out pitch. His fastball is average, thrown around 91-92 mph.

Assigned to Rookie-level Bluefield for his pro debut, Smith continued to intrigue with his power potential while holding his own at a premium position.   A .267 hitter in college who batted .271 during his pro debut, Smith's lack of average is a product of a swing that, while impactful, comes with too much swing-and-miss tendencies.

It was there where he was stationed when Seattle dealt him, Luis Rengifo and a player to be named later to Tampa Bay in August. However, Misiewicz's time with the Rays was short lived, as the Mariners re-acquired the left-hander in December in exchange for international slot money.   Misiewicz stands out more for his pitchability and durability than his stuff. He pitches with an 88-92 mph fastball that has decent life but also plays relatively straight. Misiewicz's curveball is his only above-average pitch, registering in the low 80s with downer action, and he rounds out his three-pitch mix with a low-80s changeup that has late sink as well as some fading action. Meanwhile, Misiewicz's ability to repeat his delivery enables him to throw strikes with consistency, albeit with more control than command.   Though he finished the season with a career-high 141 strikeouts, Misiewicz did miss fewer bats after moving up to Double-A, a trend that likely will continue at higher levels.

He has hit better than anticipated in pro ball and didn't look out of place in Double-A when a shortage of middle infielders necessitated his promotion there last June.  In little more than a year, Robinson has established himself as the best defender among the system's infield prospects. He has nice actions, solid range to both sides, soft hands and the arm to make all of the throws.

Even if he doesn't, Laureano's strong track record against left-handed pitching could help him carve out a reserve role.  Provided he can get back on track with his bat, Laureano could fit nicely in the leadoff spot because he pairs his on-base skills with plus speed and the know-how to steal bases.

The younger brother of C.J. and son of former professional player and coach Chris has now hit at least 25 home runs in each of his three full seasons of pro ball. Improvements in his approach led to even better offensive results in Double-A in 2017, leading to him earning Southern League MVP honors.  At 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, Cron's strength is obvious, and his raw power is at least plus. Swing-and-miss issues and a lack of plate discipline had previously held him back and forced him to repeat at Double-A in 2017. His pitch recognition improved tremendously in his second go-round in the Southern League, with the increase in walks helping to offset what will always be a healthy strikeout total. With his size and below-average speed, Cron is a little limited defensively, but he has good hands and the D-backs actually think he's deceptively strong as a fielder. He has a strong arm and could even see a little time at third in 2018.  It will be Cron's bat that gets him to The Show, and the power will have to keep showing up for him to be a regular first baseman in the big leagues.

Palka's bat speed and strength give him considerable raw power from the left side of the plate, and it translates into game production. However, he employs an all-or-nothing approach that resulted in a 27 percent strikeout rate in his first five pro seasons, so there's concern about his ability to make consistent contact against big league pitching. Palka does show a willingness to draw walks, so he could post respectable on-base percentages despite subpar batting averages.  Palka will have to keep mashing to claim and hold onto a big league role, because he doesn't offer much beyond his offense.

His slider has improved and now gives him a solid breaking ball that misses bats. He also has a developing changeup that he mixes in effectively.

While he's mostly lived up to that reputation in the pro ranks, Martin's bat remains a work in progress. Knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus sidelined Martin early in his first full season, and he produced uneven results at the plate in the Class A Advanced California League once finally healthy before a late-season promotion to Double-A Midland based on his defensive merits. Returning to the Texas League in 2017, Martin's offensive woes deepened. He mustered just a .224 average in 86 games in Texas League, prompting a demotion from the A's back to Stockton. Martin began 2018 in extended spring training as he recovers from his second offseason knee surgery in the past three years to repair a torn meniscus.  Martin's impressive range at shortstop is a product of his athleticism and above-average speed, and scouts rave about his first-step quickness as well as his overall instincts. His arm is a clean fit at the position and enables him to make highlight-reel plays, but he's also capable of getting rid of the ball quickly while on the move, without sacrificing any accuracy.  There's still some hope for Martin's bat, but his .235 average and .330 slugging percentage in his first three seasons certainly is not what the A's were expecting. He shows good bat-to-ball skills, doesn't strike out much and reaches base at a solid clip. His right-handed swing, however, yields excessive weak contact, as he all too often rolls over balls on the ground while offering little in the way of gap power, let alone over-the-fence pop. Martin's defense can still carry him to the big leagues, but not without a modicum of improvement at the plate.""",,,,,"""|""","""MIL""",0.500,"""XXX""","""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,30,55,60,60,"""|""",,,,,,,,

The Pirates leaned on Pacific Northwest scout Max Kwan, who was on Martin's offensive upside from the get-go and knew what it would take to sign him. The Pirates gave Martin well above the $100,000 threshold in the 17th round to sign him away from his Gonzaga commitment and he promptly went out and led the Gulf Coast League in home runs, on-base percentage and slugging.  Martin impressed immediately, and throughout his pro debut, with his professional at-bats. He has an advanced approach from the left side of the plate, particularly for a high schooler, drawing walks and not even giving in to left-handers on the mound. He has the chance to be at least an average hitter with above-average power if this continues, and was hitting balls over the center field wall in Pirate City during instructs. The son of a body builder, Martin is no stranger to the weight room and could approach plus power eventually.  A well below-average runner, Martin played some outfield during his pro debut, but he is likely a first baseman only long term, with work to do to be adequate defensively.

Vicuna's abilities as a shortstop are obvious. He's ultra athletic in his actions, at times flashy, with quick, twitchy hands that help him absorb anything hit his way and execute a quick release, causing his average arm strength to play. Vicuna, like many young shortstops, can be error prone at times, but consistency should come more naturally for him once he has better feel for controlling his body.    Vicuna's bat lags well behind his glove. He's punchless from the right side of the plate, with little extra-base pop despite good bat-to-ball skills and a sound approach.

Reinheimer has a reputation of being a scrappy gamer who contributes more than his tools say he should. While that's far from faint praise, he's more athletic than people give him credit for. His speed allows him to have more range defensively than many think, regardless of what position he plays. While he's played far more shortstop than anywhere else, and he's capable there, he slides over to second when needed without any difficulty. His time in the Arizona Fall League has helped him add to his versatility, with him continuing to work on playing third, and he even saw some time in the outfield in Triple-A as well.  Reinheimer knows who he is as a hitter, with advanced plate discipline and a willingness to draw walks, albeit without much power.

It took a little longer than expected, but they finally got their man at the start of the 2016 signing period for a bonus of $7 million. During his full-season debut in the Florida State League, Rodriguez both lived up to his defensive reputation and down to concerns about his potential with the bat.    It wasn't all bad offensively for the middle infielder as he wasn't overwhelmed in a pitching-friendly environment and he did hit .270 in the first half before running out of gas. More than anything, Rodriguez needs to refine his approach, learning the strike zone better and working counts more. He does have some raw power to tap into and he needs to try to do more damage rather than just playing for contact.    On the other side of the ball, the Reds feel Rodriguez is one of the best defensive shortstops in the Minors. He has tremendous instincts and a strong arm, making all of the routine plays and then frequently making a play you don't expect he can.

Morimando's fastball sits in the low 90s with good arm-side run, especially when working down in the zone. When working up, however, the left-hander can be very hittable and prone to surrendering home runs. His plus slider is a legitimate out pitch, thrown in the low 80s with hard downer action, and he's also adept at mixing in an average changeup and a fringy curveball. Morimando misses his share of bats, though many of those strikeouts are offset by his below-average command.   Morimando has proved plenty durable in career, as the 2017 season marked his fourth straight campaign with at least 150 innings pitched.

While things haven't been all bad -- he did reach Triple-A for the first time in 2017 -- it hasn't gone quite as well as planned. The Twins left him unprotected from the Rule 5 Draft this offseason and he went undrafted.  The hope had been that Stewart, as he focused on pitching only and matured, would find increased velocity and be a power-type frontline starter. He has both a four- and two-seamer, with the former topping out at around 95 mph and the other thrown with decent sink in the low 90s. He's been a groundball pitcher for much of his career, but he gets too reliant on the two-seamer at times. That's not just in relation to his four-seam fastball, but also in terms of how he incorporates his other pitches, a slider that can be above-average and fringy curveball and changeup.  As Stewart has struggled, invariable rumors of him returning to football have cropped up.

A strong Cape Cod League showing last summer catapulted him into the Friday night role for the Ducks, where he's had a bit of an up-and-down season.  At his best, Mercer stands out with his arm strength and power arsenal. His fastball will typically sit around 92-93 mph, but he can reach back for more, flashing a plus 97-mph heater at times, both on the Cape and occasionally this spring, and he does maintain his velocity throughout starts. His secondary stuff, however, has backed up some. In the past, he'd show a short, quick, deep breaking ball with late break at the plate. It's been more of a slurvy pitch this spring with more of a loopy break to it, leading to hitters laying off of it and sitting on what is a largely true fastball. He has a changeup, but doesn't throw it much.  While he does largely throw strikes, Mercer does need to refine his command within the zone.

Huff employed a more discipline, contact-oriented approach in his first year as a pro before becoming more aggressive and homer-conscious in his second.

Gatto made a living in 2017 getting hitters to beat his low-90s two-seamer into the ground. His curve can be at least above-average; it's a weapon he needs to commit to using as an out pitch more frequently in the future. That's especially important because he's yet to develop a consistent feel for a third pitch. While the progress has been encouraging, the right-hander will have to improve his control and command as he moves forward, issuing too many walks for a pitcher who doesn't miss a ton of bats.

That, along with his potential to hit for power, earned him a fifth-round selection by the A's in 2017, and he made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona League after signing an above-slot bonus of $450,000.  Sanchez's defense is his calling card. He moves much better than his stocky frame suggests, with plenty of agility and lateral quickness that aids him as a blocker. But it's his well-above-average arm strength that draws the most raves, and scouts regarded it to be among the best in his Draft class at the position. Offensively, Sanchez offers some raw power from the right side of the plate, albeit with an overly aggressive approach that he'll need to tone down in order to hit for average in the professional ranks.  Viewed as somewhat of a lottery ticket due to his impressive raw tools, Sanchez has the ingredients to develop into a glove-first catcher at the highest level, though not without first making considerable gains on both sides of the ball.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""OAK""","""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,45,,65,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,

Aiken passed on signing and enrolled in IMG Academy's (Bradenton, Fla.) post-graduate program in 2015, only to leave his first outing with elbow pain that required subsequent Tommy John surgery. The Indians still selected Aiken in the first round that June, and he signed for $2,513,280. Since turning pro, however, Aiken has looked like a shell of his former self, as the struggles he endured during his 2016 debut only worsened in '17 over a full season in the Class A Midwest League.   After showing the potential for three plus-or-better pitches as an amateur, Aiken's stuff has been average at best in the professional ranks. His fastball, which touched 97 mph in high school, now sits mostly in the upper 80s, and he has little feel for where it's going. His curveball, though no longer a hammer, still shows some promise, and he's made progress in developing his changeup.   Aiken's physical maturation in recent years has detracted from his overall athleticism, leading to problems repeating his delivery and at times resulting in a complete lack of control. That manifested in the form of 101 walks in 2017, the second-highest total in the Minor Leagues.

Despite the increased defensive responsibilities, he finished second in the low Class A South Atlantic League in doubles (35) and slugging (.489) and slammed a pair of homers in the playoffs to help Greenville win the championship. He broke a bone in his right thumb when he was hit by a pitch in Spring Training this year, missing most of the season's first month before reporting to high Class A.  Baldwin's offense is ahead of his defense. He's strong and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate, though his lack of patience could be exploited by more advanced pitchers as he rises through the Minors. Most of his power comes to his pull side and he might generate more if he adds some loft to his swing and hits fewer ground balls.

A tall and physical righty with an electric arm, Rodriguez boasts an effortless plus-fastball that touches 97 mph and sits 93-95 with angle and sink. His above-average curveball is a hammer, standing out for its power as well as the late downer action that helps him miss bats. Better control should enable Rodriguez to generate even more whiffs, though he currently struggles to repeat his delivery and arm action.   Rodriguez's PED suspension certainly hurt his progress, but the Nationals were still excited by the progress he had made up to that point.

While he hasn't quite lived up to those comps, his power bat did start showing up a bit more in 2017 as he hit his way to Double-A for the first time.    The power showed up particularly in the first half in a return engagement in the Florida State League, when he hit 15 homers and slugged .538 over 61 games to earn that promotion. He struggled a bit, with a spike in strikeouts, as he tried to adjust to the new level. He's a power-over-hit player at this point, with nearly all of his over-the-fence pop coming to his pull side. He'll need a more consistent approach, with better plate discipline, in order to find success at the upper levels and profile as an everyday corner infielder.    LaValley played first base exclusively in 2017 because of the presence of top prospect Nick Senzel at third.

A true gamer taken in the third round of the 2015 Draft out of Louisiana-Lafayette, Trahan can do a lot of the little things well to help a team win.    One thing he didn't do in 2017 was hit. The shortstop does have excellent contact and on-base skills, keeping his walk rate high and his strikeout rate low. But he tried to do too much at the plate and get too big. Power is never going to be a part of his game, so he needs to get back to the line-drive approach that served him better previously in his Minor League career. Trahan is a very solid defender at shortstop and could stay there if needed, but after seeing time at second base during his stint in the Arizona Fall League, he's going to start moving all over the field more.    The Reds are confident that Trahan, a plus-effort, high-energy sparkplug, will play in the big leagues.

He has struggled to show much else, however, struggling to make consistent contact and to handle the defensive responsibilities behind the plate.  With his bat speed, strength, leverage and pull-crazy approach, Vallot can mash tape-measure shots to left field. But selling out for power leads to a lot of swings and misses, which is why he carried a career .226 batting average and 35 percent strikeout rate into 2018. He's willing to take walks when pitchers won't challenge him, so he posts respectable on-base percentages.  Though it's not a matter of effort, there are few scouts who think Vallot can play the position in the big leagues. He doesn't move well, struggling with his receiving and his solid arm strength plays down because he has a slow transfer and lacks accuracy.

Breaux has well above-average raw power to all fields and an aggressive right-handed swing that generates uncommon bat speed. He has a maximum-effort approach at the plate (and on the mound), and while he doesn't strike out excessively, his lack of patience is a cause of concern.

Soto made his pro debut in the United States last summer, playing in the Gulf Coast League and while the slash line of .225/.332/.254 doesn't exactly jump off the page, there were some things to like with Soto's first offensive foray into pro ball. The teenaged infielder showed a really advanced approach, especially that he was 17 years old at the time, walking more often than he struck out. He makes a lot of contact with a line-drive approach, but lacks current strength to do much more than put the ball in play. Believers feel he will be able to add to his frame, which will allow him to become a more impactful hitter. Defensively, Soto has a strong arm and good hands, with the chance to be a plus defender at a premium position.    Given his age and lack of physicality, it's clear Soto has a long way to go before being a finished product.

Genoves caught for touted Padres right-handed pitching prospect Anderson Espinoza as an amateur, helping him get accustomed to handling quality stuff at a young age. He has the makings of a solid receiver with a plus arm that helped him throw out 33 percent of basestealers in his U.S. debut last year. He moves well behind the plate, had a durable frame and shows leadership ability.  Genoves has a lower ceiling offensively and how much he hits will determine whether he's a starter or a reserve. He employs a contact-oriented approach from the right side of the plate, giving him a chance to hit for a decent average.

A shoulder injury in 2016 after he hit over .300 the prior summer forced him out for most of the season. He returned in 2017, though his ability to impact the baseball did not.  Carpio was never going to be a big power guy, but he had shown enough strength to not have the bat knocked out of his hand. He has a solid feel to hit with a good approach at the plate and a willingness to draw walks, but in his first year back he didn't have the strength to approach being an aveage hitter. The Mets are hoping he can get back to occasionally driving the ball another year removed from his shoulder surgery. He had the defensive chops to play shortstop regularly, but primarily played second base because of the shoulder in 2017. An average runner, he's smart enough to swipe some bases.  Carpio is still plenty young enough to get headed back in the right direction.

Over his first two years, he was a glove-first backstop, but his Draft profile really jumped when his bat caught up to his defense as a junior, landing him in the third round. He was tired during his pro debut and the Tigers think they'll be getting a look at the real Joey Morgan in 2018.  Morgan built a strong defensive reputation at Washington, showing good receiving and blocking skills and an above-average arm. It looked more like average during his summer pro debut, though he still threw out just over 30 percent of potential basestealers in the New York-Penn League. While he was a much better hitter in his junior season, it remains to be seen how the bat will play at this level. He makes consistent contact, but didn't show much in the way of the extra-base ability that raised his profile in college.   Morgan will have to show how he can stand up to the rigors of a long season, while continuing to add strength and showing he can be an all-around catcher.

While the Orioles still took a flyer on him in the 26th round in June, it appeared that the two sides were unable to strike a deal prior to the July 7 signing deadline. It later was revealed, however, that Baltimore actually had submitted its $605,000 deal with Bishop nearly five minutes after the deadline had passed, and a corresponding investigation by Major League Baseball determined that the signing was valid because the parties agreed to a contract before the deadline. Spending most of his pro debut with Class A Short Season Aberdeen, Bishop pitched to a 0.78 ERA with 38 strikeouts in 35 innings.   A 6-foot-4, 215-pound left-hander, Bishop can run his fastball up to 95 mph, albeit with little feel for where it's going. He features a pair of breaking balls in a curveball and slider, both of which currently grade as fringe-average but stand to improve with experience. The same can be said for his changeup, too.   Bishop's feel for pitching leaves quite a bit to be desired, as both his control and command grade out as below average. At the same time, he does have the raw components needed to start games at the next level, as well as the pure arm strength to become a late-inning reliever should that not work out.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""BAL""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,45,45,45,,,,40

The Nationals drafted him in the fourth round the following year, making Reetz the first Nebraskan prep to be picked in the top five rounds since 1996. While he has made progress in the subsequent years, especially as a defender, injuries in back-to-back years have kept Reetz from developing as hoped.   Despite having a quick right-handed swing that yields line drives across the whole field, Reetz has struggled to hit for average as a pro. The same can be said about Reetz's power, though he does hit the ball consistently harder now after learning how to better apply his lower half in 2016. Reetz continues to show plate discipline and a solid approach at the plate, qualities that some within the organization believe will help his bat to eventually come around.   Defensively, Reetz stands out most for the arm strength and catch-and-throw skills that produced a career-best caught-stealing rate of 31 percent in 2017.

A three-time Florida state champion with powerhouse Archbishop McCarthy High School, Gonzalez pitched to mixed results during his 2015 full-season debut with Class A Delmarva before wearing down late and finishing the year on the disabled list. He proved plenty durable the following year, logging a career-high 147 2/3 innings with Delmarva, and tacked on another 106 1/3 frames in 2017 before a left hand injury suffered in late July prematurely ended his year.   While he's not overpowering, Gonzalez does generate good life on a fastball that sits in the low 90s and touches 93-94 mph, all while creating good downhill angle to the plate that makes his heater difficult to lift. The effectiveness of Gonzalez's secondary offerings is predicated on his fastball command, which has improved in the past two seasons, but remains below average overall. He does have good feel for a changeup, a pitch that will flash above average with late fading action, and his curveball gives him a usable third pitch.

The Nationals have challenged Ward with aggressive full-season assignments, and he made steady progress before advancing to Double-A at age 21. Making his return to the Eastern League in 2017, Ward's production declined across the board as he battled through a wrist injury that ultimately required offseason surgery.   Ward is a patient left-handed hitter who sees a lot of pitches and takes his walks. That in turn leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss, highlighted by his career-high 27 percent strikeout rate in 2017, while also limiting the quality of his contact. Raw power was Ward's calling card as an amateur, and he started to tap into it in 2016. He didn't show that kind of pop back in Double-A, though club officials believe he'll eventually learn to get to it with regularity.  A shortstop in high school, Ward has played third base almost exclusively in the Minor Leagues.

Putting that adversity behind him, McCullough has been extremely hard to hit as a pro, though he has struggled to consistently find the strike zone.  Left unprotected in the Rule 5 Draft last December, McCullough wasn't selected largely because of those command issues. There is absolutely no question about whether his pure stuff can get people out, as evidenced by his career 11.8 K/9 rate and .188 batting average against (14.1 and .158 in 2017 across two levels). His fastball is at least plus, typically in the upper 90s. Hitters don't see his slider and he misses a ton of bats with it.

He was able to use his on-base and defensive skills to work his way to Double-A. Sent to the Arizona Fall League to make up for some of that lost time, he was sent home early with a shoulder impingement. He was good to go to start the 2018 season, which included a position switch to third base.    Ward had a quietly solid season in 2017 in some areas, most notably in terms of his plate discipline. He has a very advanced approach at the plate, with nearly as many walks as strikeouts a year ago, leading to a career .366 on-base percentage heading into 2018. He utilizes a contact-first, line-drive approach to his hitting and rarely chases, though his power started to show up in 2018. Ward's strong arm, which allowed him to throw out just over 34 percent of potential basestealers from behind the plate, is an asset at the hot corner.    Now in the upper levels of the Angels system, Ward should be ready to help out in the near future.

A breakout 2015 full-season debut quickly made him a popular name in trade talks, and he became the key return for Oakland in the July trade that sent Scott Kazmir to Houston. After being traded once again that offseason, this time to Milwaukee in the Khris Davis deal, Nottingham struggled to find consistency on both sides of the ball during a full season in Double-A, and then once again in his return to the level in 2017.  Nottingham's big raw power was once viewed as his carrying tool, but he has struggled to apply it in games since advancing to Double-A, where he's totaled 20 homers in 213 games over two full seasons. Some of that is tied to pitchers being able to exploit his aggressive approach, though he did make gains in that regard in 2017 by improving both his strikeout and walk rates. Yet, those adjustments haven't stopped evaluators from questioning the future utility of his offensive profile.   Nottingham's stagnation at the plate hasn't kept him from making significant strides behind it, though, and club officials were very impressed with his improved catch-and-throw skills and overall progress as a blocker and receiver in 2017, when he threw out 40 percent of attempted basestealers in the Southern League.

The tall right-hander was a first-team all-WAC performer as a sophomore, then used a strong performance in the Cape Cod League to springboard to an even better junior year to put him firmly on the Draft radar.  There's a lot to like with this Arizona native's size and stuff. The 6-foot-4 righty has a fastball-curve combination that's attractive to many teams. He'll sit 92-94 mph with his fastball, and can touch 96 mph at times. He has a big 12-to-6 curve, thrown in the 76-80 mph range, that he uses effectively as his out pitch, and he mixes in a changeup. A big x-factor for Bradsish might be his cutter-like slider, thrown in the upper-80s, that could develop into a much better pitch in the future. All of it comes from a catapult-like delivery with a lot of moving pieces. The positive of that is deception; the negative is spotty command, which gets away from him when he tries to go up and down in the zone or gets off to the side in his delivery.  There's a split camp among scouts about Bradish's future role. With the potential for a four-pitch mix, a team taking him in the top three rounds is bound to let him head out as a starter, but knowing that his fastball-curve combination could tick up in shorter relief stints provides a nice backup plan.""",,,"""|""",,,,"""|""","""LAA""",121,,,,"""|""","""New Mexico State""","""""","""New Mexico State""","""Junior""","""|""",,,,"""|""",0,0,0,1,"""|""","""+""","""+""","""""","""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",60,45,50,50,,,,45

But an inconsistent prep senior season and worries about his mechanics rendered him unsignable, so he headed to North Carolina after turning down the Red Sox as a 38th-rounder in the 2016 Draft. Now a similar scenario is unfolding this year, when Berger has followed a banner summer in the Cape Cod League with an up-and-down spring and may not get picked high enough as a Draft-eligible sophomore to turn pro.  Bergner can show flashes of three plus pitches but doesn't produce that kind of stuff on a regular basis. He often worked with a mid-90s fastball on the Cape, but he sat in the low 90s this spring, and his heater is hittable because it lacks much life. His best secondary offering is a mid-80s changeup with fade, though he lacks feel to spin and doesn't trust his curveball.  The biggest issue with Bergner is his delivery, which is long in back and short in front. It affects the quality and command of his pitches and also allows hitters to get a good look at them.

It's true again this spring with Halvorsen, which may make him follow through on a commitment to Missouri. He wants to play shortstop and pro teams clearly prefer him on the mound.  Halvorsen throws harder than most high schoolers, hitting 96 mph while earning a save in the Perfect Game All-American Classic last August and pumping the second-quickest fastball (95.4 mph) at the World Wood Bat Assocation World Championship last October.

He generates his velocity with arm speed rather than effort and has some armside run on his heater.

Though Williamson still needs to develop further, the progress he has made at North Iowa Area CC is encouraging. He repeatedly has worked at 90-92 mph and topped out at 95 all spring despite brutal weather in the Midwest, and his fastball gets swings and misses in the strike zone with its late life and downhill plane.

He sits around 90-93 mph with life on his fastball and usually touches 95-96 with less movement a couple of times each game.

Defensively, Decolati has a strong arm and will show the ability to make tough plays, but will boot routine ones at times. Primarily a shortstop in college, he might be better suited for third base, with some thinking a corner outfield spot would work.

Mangum's best tool is his speed, which grades as plus-plus out of the batter's box but doesn't play quite that fast and hasn't translated into elite basestealing or defensive ability. A switch-hitter, he concentrates on making contact and getting on base, an approach that leaves him with almost no power.

Although his velocity was down during his junior year, the Mariners believed he had more in the tank and were happy to gamble on his upside in the sixth round. Wilcox pitched out of the bullpen exclusively in his pro debut, when he ranked second in the Northwest League with nine saves and held opposing hitters to a .185 average. He saw some time as a starter the following year before returning to a bullpen role in 2017 with Class A Clinton, where he was enjoying his best professional campaign until a strained right rotator cuff in early July prematurely ended his season.  An athletic and projectable right-hander, Wilcox generates easy velocity with a loose, quick arm, as he'll sit between 89-93 mph and top out at 94. He doesn't get on top of his curveball consistently, which detracts from its shape and action, but it will flash above average at its best. He also has a changeup, though it's become a seldom-used offering since his move back to the bullpen.  While the Mariners gave some thought to developing Wilcox as a starter out of the Draft based on his athleticism, arm strength and three-pitch mix, his age, injury history and below-average control all portend a full-time bullpen role moving forward.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""SEA""","""|""",0,0,1,1,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",55,40,50,,,,,40

After pitching in middle relief as a freshman, he emerged as the Wolverines' best starter the last two seasons. His 119 strikeouts as a junior matched Michigan's single-season record (Jim Burton, 1970) and also ranked 17th among all NCAA Division I hurlers. That knack for missing bats earned Jaskie a selection in the fourth round by Seattle, and he made his pro debut with Class A Short Season Everett after signing for $245,600.    Jaskie's standout pitch is a changeup that arrives in the low 80s and drops off the table as it approaches the plate. While he has gotten stronger, he won't overpower hitters with a fastball that tops out at 93 mph and usually settles in at 88-90. It plays above its velocity, however, because he commands it well and because his funky delivery leads to some awkward swings.    Though his mechanics are unorthodox, Jaskie repeats them well and doesn't have any problem finding the strike zone. His biggest need is to improve his fringy slider, and he's committed to using it so he'll have a true three-pitch mix. His durable frame lends itself well to an innings-eating role at the back of a rotation or as a swingman.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",50,50,,45,,,,50

The Mariners selected Taylor from Arizona in the Minor League portion of the Rule 5 Draft in December and assigned him to Double-A, where he put together his best and most complete offensive season to date in the Texas League, earning All-Star honors for the first time in his professional career at age 23.    Taylor has shown feel to hit throughout his time in the Minors. A switch-hitter, he has good bat speed, makes consistent contact and demonstrates good plate discipline as well as a knowledge of the strike zone. He's equally productive from both sides of the plate, a notion supported by his .286 and .270 averages last season as a right- and left-handed hitter, respectively. His uptick in the power department in 2017 was a major development, though he'll likely always offer more pop to the gaps than true over-the-fence thump. And while he may not be a burner, Taylor does have average speed and earns praise for his baserunning ability.    Taylor is best suited for left field defensively on account of his below-average arm strength, though he does have experience at all three outfield positions. That versatility, along with his late-blooming bat, could help him carve out a role as fifth outfielder at the highest level.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,40,50,45,50,"""|""",,,,,,,,

He split his first full season between the Midwest League, where he was a midseason All-Star, and the California League, and then spent all of 2017 pitching out of the bullpen for Double-A Arkansas. Among Texas League relievers, Gillies ranked fifth in opponent average (.231) and 11th in appearances (39). Following the season, Gillies represented the Mariners in the Arizona Fall League.    A tall and physical right-hander, Gillies employs a clean delivery with short arm action on the backside that causes his 92-94 mph four-seam fastball to jump on opposing hitters. His slider represents a second average-or-better offering, registering at 82-83 mph with late, hard sweeping action. Gillies demonstrates confidence and feel for locating both pitches, especially the slider, though his current command profile leaves something to be desired.    Gillies experienced a dip in his strikeout rate with the move up to the Texas League, but the right-hander still showed the ability to miss bats on both sides of the plate with his fastball-slider combo. That quality, as well as better fastball command, could lead to a seventh-inning role at the highest level.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",55,,,50,,,,45

The Mariners selected Brigman with the No. 87 overall pick in the third round, and he signed for $700,000. Making his full-season debut in 2017, Brigman, despite being an older player in the Class A Midwest League, showed little impact potential at the plate but excelled with his glove at both middle-infield positions.    Brigman does a lot of things fairly well, though no single tool is plus. He has a solid approach, makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate and can steal some bases now and again. The quality of Brigman's contact leaves something to be desired, though, leading some scouts to question whether he'll ever be strong enough to consistently drive the baseball. He's a capable defender at shortstop, though most believe he'll need to move over to second base, where his below-average arm strength is a better fit. But he was impressive with his glove on both sides of the second-base bag in the Northwest League, committing just two errors apiece at the positions.     The Mariners intend to give Brigman the chance to stick at short, but his ability to play second should work in his favor and ultimately could help him carve out a role as a quality backup at both spots. To achieve that, however, he'll first need to make gains at the plate.""",,,,,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,"""|""",,,,,"""|""",,,"""SEA""","""|""",0,0,0,0,"""|""",,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""|""",45,30,55,45,55,"""|""",,,,,,,,
